Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: A positive integer \( X \) (2 ≤ \( X \) ≤ \( 10^{18} \)).
2. **Output**: An array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists.
3. **Constraints**:
   - The array length should be at most 200.
   - All elements of the array should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the integer \( x \) for the current test case.
   - It initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of the subsequences.
   - It also initializes `mx` to keep track of the maximum length of the subsequences.

3. **Handling \( x = 2 \)**:
   - If \( x \) is 2, the program prints 1 and 0. This is correct because the array [0] has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence [0].

4. **Decomposing \( x \)**:
   - The program uses a while loop to decompose \( x \) into a sum of powers of 2.
   - It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( x \) and appends the corresponding exponent to `subseq_lens`.
   - It then subtracts this power of 2 from \( x \) and updates `mx` to the maximum exponent found.

5. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The program constructs the array `ansv` by first adding integers from 0 to `mx - 1`.
   - It then appends the elements of `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of `ansv`.
   - It prints the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Decomposition of \( x \)**:
   - The program correctly decomposes \( x \) into a sum of distinct powers of 2. This is a valid approach because any positive integer can be represented uniquely as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (binary representation).

2. **Array Construction**:
   - The program constructs the array by adding integers from 0 to `mx - 1`, which ensures that the array has a strictly increasing subsequence.
   - It then appends the elements of `subseq_lens`, which are the exponents of the powers of 2 used in the decomposition. This ensures that the array has exactly \( x \) increasing subsequences.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case \( x = 2 \) correctly by printing a single element array [0].
   - For other values of \( x \), the program should always find a valid decomposition and construct a valid array.

4. **Constraints**:
   - The length of the array is at most `mx + len(subseq_lens)`, which is at most 200 for \( x \leq 10^{18} \).
   - The elements of the array are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by decomposing \( x \) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 and constructing an array that has exactly \( x \) increasing subsequences. The constraints are also respected.

Correctness: **True**
