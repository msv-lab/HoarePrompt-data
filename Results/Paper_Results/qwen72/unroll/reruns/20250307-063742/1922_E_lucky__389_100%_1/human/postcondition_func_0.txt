The function `func_1` reads an integer `x` from the user input, where `2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18`. If `x` is 2, it prints "1" and "0" and then returns without further processing. For other values of `x`, it calculates the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to `x`, and stores these lengths in a list `subseq_lens`. It then constructs a list `ansv` that contains integers from 0 to the maximum length of these subsequences minus 1, followed by the elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end. The function prints the length of `ansv` and then prints the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
