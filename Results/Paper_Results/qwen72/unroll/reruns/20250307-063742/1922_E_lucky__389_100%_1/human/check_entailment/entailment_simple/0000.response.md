Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over them. However, the function `func_1()` is called without passing the input `x` to it. This is a mistake because `func_1()` needs to know the value of `x` to solve the problem. The function should be called with `x` as an argument, like `func_1(x)`.

2. **Base Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the base case where `x` is 2. It prints 1 and 0, which is a valid solution since the array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`.

3. **Subsequence Calculation**: The program attempts to decompose `x` into a sum of distinct powers of 2. This is a valid approach because any integer can be uniquely represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (this is the binary representation of the number). The program correctly appends the exponents of these powers to the list `subseq_lens` and subtracts the corresponding power of 2 from `x`.

4. **Array Construction**: The program constructs the array `ansv` by first adding integers from 0 to `mx-1` (where `mx` is the maximum exponent found in the decomposition). This ensures that the array has a strictly increasing subsequence of length `mx`. Then, it appends the elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end of `ansv`. This is incorrect because it does not ensure that the array has exactly `x` increasing subsequences. The correct approach should be to append the elements of `subseq_lens` to `ansv` directly, without the initial range from 0 to `mx-1`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the length of `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv`. However, due to the incorrect array construction, the output may not be correct for all values of `x`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where `x` is 1, which is outside the given range but should be considered for completeness. The problem specifies that `2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18`, so this case is not strictly necessary, but it would be a good practice to handle it.

7. **Correctness of the Algorithm**: The algorithm for decomposing `x` into powers of 2 is correct, but the construction of the array `ansv` is flawed. The array should be constructed by appending the exponents directly to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.

Given these points, the program is incorrect due to the flawed array construction and the incorrect handling of the function call.

Correctness: **False**
