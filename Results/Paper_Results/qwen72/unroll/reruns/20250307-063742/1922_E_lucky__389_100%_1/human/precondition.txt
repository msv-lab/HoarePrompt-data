The function `solve` is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should either return -1 if no valid array exists, or return a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) followed by a list of n integers that form an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. Each element of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
