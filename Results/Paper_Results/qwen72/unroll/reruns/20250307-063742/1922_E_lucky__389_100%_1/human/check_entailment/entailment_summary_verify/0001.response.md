### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the function summary and the original assessment.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and calls `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the integer \( x \) for the current test case.
   - It initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of the subsequences.
   - It also initializes `mx` to keep track of the maximum length of the subsequences.

3. **Handling \( x = 2 \)**:
   - If \( x \) is 2, the program prints 1 and 0. This is correct because the array [0] has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence [0].

4. **Decomposing \( x \)**:
   - The program uses a while loop to decompose \( x \) into a sum of powers of 2.
   - It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( x \) and appends the corresponding exponent to `subseq_lens`.
   - It then subtracts this power of 2 from \( x \) and updates `mx` to the maximum exponent found.
   - This approach is correct because any positive integer can be uniquely represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (binary representation).

5. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The program constructs the array `ansv` by first adding integers from 0 to `mx - 1`.
   - It then appends the elements of `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.
   - This ensures that the array has a strictly increasing subsequence from 0 to `mx - 1`, and the elements of `subseq_lens` are appended to ensure the total number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( x \).

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of `ansv`.
   - It prints the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces.

### Edge Cases and Constraints:
- **Edge Case \( x = 2 \)**:
  - The program correctly handles this case by printing a single element array [0].
- **Other Values of \( x \)**:
  - The program should always find a valid decomposition and construct a valid array.
- **Array Length**:
  - The length of the array is at most `mx + len(subseq_lens)`, which is at most 200 for \( x \leq 10^{18} \).
- **Element Range**:
  - The elements of the array are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

### Potential Issues:
- **Handling \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \)**:
  - The problem description specifies \( 2 \leq x \leq 10^{18} \), so the program does not need to handle \( x = 0 \) or \( x = 1 \).
- **Handling \( x = 3 \)**:
  - For \( x = 3 \), the program should decompose \( x \) into \( 2^1 + 2^0 \). This results in `subseq_lens = [1, 0]` and `mx = 1`.
  - The array constructed is `[0, 1, 0]`, which has 3 increasing subsequences: [], [0], [0, 1], [0], [1], [0, 1].
  - This is correct, but the array `[0, 1]` would also be a valid and simpler solution.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly decomposes \( x \) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 and constructs an array that has exactly \( x \) increasing subsequences. The constraints are respected, and the program handles the specified range of \( x \) values correctly.

Final: **True**
