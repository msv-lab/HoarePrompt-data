Based on the initial state provided:

- The function is designed to take an integer \( X \) (where \( 2 \leq X \leq 10^{18} \)) as input.
- The number of test cases \( t \) is an integer (where \( 1 \leq t \leq 1000 \)).
- The variable `x` is assigned the value of the input integer \( X \).
- The current value of `x` is 2.
- `subseq_lens` is an empty list.
- `mx` is 0.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(0)
```

The `print` statement is simply printing the integer 0. The values of `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx` do not affect the output of this statement.

Output: **0**
