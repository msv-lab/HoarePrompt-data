Postcondition: **The function should take an integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) as input, and the input should be provided through multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). `x` is assigned the value of the input integer. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0. Additionally, `x` is not equal to 2.**
