Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `x == 2` Case**:
   - The program prints `1` and `0` when `x == 2`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2` and `0 1` because the array `[0, 1]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[0]` and `[1]`.

2. **Incorrect Subsequence Length Calculation**:
   - The program uses a loop to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` and then subtracts it from `x`. However, this approach does not correctly handle the construction of the array to ensure exactly `x` increasing subsequences.
   - The program should construct the array in a way that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `x`. The current logic may not always achieve this.

3. **Incorrect Array Construction**:
   - The program appends the indices of the subsequence lengths to the array, but this does not guarantee that the array will have exactly `x` increasing subsequences.
   - The array elements should be chosen in a way that ensures the correct number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Handling of `x == 1`**:
   - The problem description states that `2 \le X \le 10^{18}`, so the program does not need to handle `x == 1`. However, the logic should be consistent and correct for all valid inputs.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you can use the following approach:
- For a given `x`, find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` and subtract it from `x`.
- Repeat the process until `x` becomes 0.
- Construct the array such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `x`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    if x == 2:
        print(2)
        print(0, 1)
        return
    subseq_lens = []
    while x > 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        i -= 1
        subseq_lens.append(i)
        x -= 2 ** i
    ansv = []
    for i in subseq_lens:
        ansv.extend([i] * (i + 1))
    print(len(ansv))
    print(*ansv)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Handling `x == 2`**:
  - Directly prints `2` and `0 1` for `x == 2`.
- **Subsequence Length Calculation**:
  - Uses a loop to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` and subtracts it from `x`.
  - Appends the corresponding subsequence length to the list `subseq_lens`.
- **Array Construction**:
  - Constructs the array by extending it with the subsequence length repeated `i + 1` times.
  - This ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `x`.

This corrected program should work correctly for all valid inputs as described in the problem.
