Precondition: **The function should take an integer X (2 \le X \le 10^{18}) as input, and the input should be provided through multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer (1 \le t \le 1000).** 

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept the number of test cases and the integer X for each test case. A more appropriate function definition would be:

```
def find_array_with_subsequences(t, X_list):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases and `X_list` is a list of integers, each representing X for a test case. Each integer X in `X_list` should satisfy the precondition: **X is an integer (2 \le X \le 10^{18})**.
