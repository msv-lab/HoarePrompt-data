Output State: **x is 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to 0, mx is the maximum length of these subsequences, ansv is a list of integers from 0 to mx-1.**

The initial state remains unchanged for `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx`. The new variable `ansv` is created as a list of integers ranging from 0 to `mx-1`.
