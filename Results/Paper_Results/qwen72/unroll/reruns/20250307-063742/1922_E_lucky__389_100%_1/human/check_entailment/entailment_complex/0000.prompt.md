Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

# Annotated Program:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer X (2 \le X \le 10^{18}) as input, and the input should be provided through multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer (1 \le t \le 1000).
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: The function should take an integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) as input, and the input should be provided through multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). `x` is assigned the value of the input integer. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0. Additionally, `x` is not equal to 2.
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: x = 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to the initial value of x, and mx is the maximum length of these subsequences.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: x is 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to 0, mx is the maximum length of these subsequences, ansv is a list containing the integers from 0 to mx-1 followed by the elements of subseq_lens from index 1 to the end.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: - The `print(len(ansv))` statement will print the total length of the `ansv` list.
    #
    #Output:
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: x is 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to 0, mx is the maximum length of these subsequences, ansv is a list containing the integers from 0 to mx-1 followed by the elements of subseq_lens from index 1 to the end.
    print()
    #This is printed: (newline character)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `x` from the user input, where `2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18`. If `x` is 2, it prints "1" and "0" and then returns without further processing. For other values of `x`, it calculates the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to `x`, and stores these lengths in a list `subseq_lens`. It then constructs a list `ansv` that contains integers from 0 to the maximum length of these subsequences minus 1, followed by the elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end. The function prints the length of `ansv` and then prints the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
