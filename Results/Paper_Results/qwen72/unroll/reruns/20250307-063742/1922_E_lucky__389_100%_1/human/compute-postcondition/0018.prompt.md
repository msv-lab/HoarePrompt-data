You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer X (2 \le X \le 10^{18}) as input, and the input should be provided through multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer (1 \le t \le 1000).
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: The function should take an integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) as input, and the input should be provided through multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). `x` is assigned the value of the input integer. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0. Additionally, `x` is not equal to 2.
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: x = 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to the initial value of x, and mx is the maximum length of these subsequences.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: x is 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to 0, mx is the maximum length of these subsequences, ansv is a list containing the integers from 0 to mx-1 followed by the elements of subseq_lens from index 1 to the end.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: - The `print(len(ansv))` statement will print the total length of the `ansv` list.
    #
    #Output:
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: x is 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to 0, mx is the maximum length of these subsequences, ansv is a list containing the integers from 0 to mx-1 followed by the elements of subseq_lens from index 1 to the end.
    print()
    #This is printed: (newline character)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
