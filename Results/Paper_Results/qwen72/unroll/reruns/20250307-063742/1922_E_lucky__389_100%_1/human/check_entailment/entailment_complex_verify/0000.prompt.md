You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer X (2 \le X \le 10^{18}) as input, and the input should be provided through multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer (1 \le t \le 1000).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `x` from the user input, where `2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18`. If `x` is 2, it prints "1" and "0" and then returns without further processing. For other values of `x`, it calculates the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to `x`, and stores these lengths in a list `subseq_lens`. It then constructs a list `ansv` that contains integers from 0 to the maximum length of these subsequences minus 1, followed by the elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end. The function prints the length of `ansv` and then prints the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly handle the case where `x` is a power of 2. For example, if `x = 4`, the program will output an incorrect array. Here is the detailed reasoning:

1. **Input: `x = 4`**
   - The program will enter the while loop and find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 4, which is 4 itself.
   - It will then append `i - 1` (which is 2) to `subseq_lens` and subtract `2 ** (i - 1)` (which is 4) from `x`.
   - `x` becomes 0, and the while loop exits.
   - The program then prints the length of `ansv` (which is 2) and the array `[0, 2]`.

However, the correct output for `x = 4` should be an array that has exactly 4 increasing subsequences. The array `[0, 2]` only has 3 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, and `[2]`. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
