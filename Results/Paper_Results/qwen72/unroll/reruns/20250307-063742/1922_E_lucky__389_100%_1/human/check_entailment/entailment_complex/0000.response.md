Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one. This matches the problem's requirement for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Special Case Handling**: The program handles the special case where `x` is 2 by printing "1" and "0". This is correct because the only array of length at most 200 that has exactly 2 increasing subsequences is `[0]`, which has the subsequences `[]` and `[0]`.

3. **Subsequence Calculation**:
   - The program uses a while loop to break down `x` into a sum of powers of 2, storing the exponents in `subseq_lens`. This approach is based on the fact that any positive integer can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (binary representation).
   - The loop correctly calculates the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` and subtracts it from `x`, appending the exponent to `subseq_lens`.

4. **Array Construction**:
   - The program constructs the array `ansv` by first including integers from 0 to `mx-1`, where `mx` is the maximum exponent found in the breakdown of `x`.
   - It then appends the elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end of `ansv`. This ensures that the array contains the necessary elements to form the required number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces, followed by a newline. This matches the required output format.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `x` is 1, which is outside the problem's input range (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). However, since the problem guarantees that `x` will be within the valid range, this is not a concern.
   - The program does not handle the case where `x` is greater than the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed with an array of length 200. However, the problem does not specify an upper limit on `x` other than 10^18, and the program's approach should theoretically handle any valid `x` within that range.

7. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach of breaking down `x` into a sum of powers of 2 and constructing the array based on these exponents is mathematically sound and should produce the correct number of increasing subsequences.
   - The constructed array `ansv` will have a length of at most 200, as the maximum number of distinct powers of 2 that can sum up to 10^18 is much less than 200.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct in terms of logic and implementation for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
