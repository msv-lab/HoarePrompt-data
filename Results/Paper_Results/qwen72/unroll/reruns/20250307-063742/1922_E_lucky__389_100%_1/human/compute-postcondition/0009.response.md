Output State: **x = 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to the initial value of x, and mx is the maximum length of these subsequences.**

### Explanation:
- **x**: The loop continues to subtract the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` until `x` becomes 0. Therefore, after all iterations, `x` will be 0.
- **subseq_lens**: This list will contain the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2 that were subtracted from `x` during each iteration of the loop. Each element in the list represents the exponent of the power of 2 that was subtracted from `x`.
- **mx**: This variable keeps track of the maximum length of the subsequences (i.e., the highest exponent of 2 that was subtracted from `x`). After the loop, `mx` will be the largest exponent of 2 that was used in the decomposition of `x`.

For example, if the initial value of `x` is 10, the loop will subtract 8 (2^3), 2 (2^1), and 0 (2^0) in that order. The final state will be:
- `x = 0`
- `subseq_lens = [3, 1, 0]`
- `mx = 3` (since 3 is the largest exponent used)
