Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is 0.
   - `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to 0.
   - `mx` is the maximum length of these subsequences.
   - `ansv` is a list containing the integers from 0 to `mx-1` followed by the elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `x` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `subseq_lens` is a list of integers. The exact values are not provided, but we know they represent the lengths of subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to 0.
   - `mx` is the maximum value in the `subseq_lens` list.
   - `ansv` is constructed by first including integers from 0 to `mx-1` and then appending the elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end.

3. **Constructing `ansv`:**
   - The first part of `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1`. This means if `mx` is 5, the first part of `ansv` will be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - The second part of `ansv` is the elements of `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 to the end. This means if `subseq_lens` is `[3, 2, 1, 4]`, the second part of `ansv` will be `[2, 1, 4]`.

4. **Combining the Parts:**
   - If `mx` is 5 and `subseq_lens` is `[3, 2, 1, 4]`, then `ansv` will be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 4]`.

5. **Calculating the Length of `ansv`:**
   - The length of the first part of `ansv` is `mx`.
   - The length of the second part of `ansv` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`.
   - Therefore, the total length of `ansv` is `mx + (len(subseq_lens) - 1)`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(len(ansv))` statement will print the total length of the `ansv` list.

Output: **mx + (len(subseq_lens) - 1) (where mx is the maximum length of the subsequences in subseq_lens and len(subseq_lens) is the length of the subseq_lens list)**
