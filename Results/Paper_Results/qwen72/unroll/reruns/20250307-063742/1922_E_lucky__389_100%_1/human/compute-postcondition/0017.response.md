The function `func_1` is described with parameter constraints and relationships that indicate it should take an integer `X` (where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) as input, and the input should be provided through multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). However, the function signature provided does not include any parameters. Given this, the function as described does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.**
