The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `start`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the number of nodes in a tree. `edges` is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n, and each tuple represents an edge connecting two nodes in the tree. `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, representing the starting node for some operation within the tree. The function returns one of two strings based on the input parameters and the structure of the tree:
- Case_1: If certain conditions are met, the function returns the string 'Ron'.
- Case_2: If the conditions for Case_1 are not met, the function returns the string 'Hermione'.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, a list of tuples `edges`, and an integer `start`. It returns 'Ron' if certain conditions are met, otherwise it returns 'Hermione'.**
