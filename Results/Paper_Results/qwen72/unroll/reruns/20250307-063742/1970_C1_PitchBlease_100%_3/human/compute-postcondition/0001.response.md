Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, and the tree is represented as a dictionary or adjacency list where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors. `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.**

The initial state is updated to include the `visited` set, which now contains the integer `start`. The other variables (`start`, `target`, `n`, and `queue`) remain unchanged.
