For the loop to execute the first time, the condition in the `while` loop head must be true. The loop head is `while queue:`, which means the loop will execute as long as the `queue` is not empty.

State right before the loop:
- `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`.
- The tree is represented as a dictionary or adjacency list where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors.
- `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`.
- `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.

The `queue` is already initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`, which means it is not empty. Therefore, the condition `while queue:` is already true, and no adjustments are needed for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, and the tree is represented as a dictionary or adjacency list where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors. `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.**
