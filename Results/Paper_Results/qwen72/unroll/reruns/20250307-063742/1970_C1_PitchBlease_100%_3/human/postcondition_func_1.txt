The function `bfs` accepts two integers `start` and `target` representing node indices in a tree. It performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is reachable from the `start` node, the function returns the shortest distance as an integer. If the `target` node is not reachable, the function returns -1. The function does not modify the tree or any external state.
