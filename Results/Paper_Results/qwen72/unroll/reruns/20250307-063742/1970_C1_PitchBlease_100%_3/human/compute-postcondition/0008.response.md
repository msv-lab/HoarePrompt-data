Postcondition: **`tree` is a defaultdict of type list where each key is an integer from 1 to n, and the value for each key is a list of integers representing the nodes directly connected to that key by an edge in the tree. The lists are populated based on the edges provided, and each edge (u, v) is represented twice: once in `tree[u]` and once in `tree[v]`. `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged. `leaves` is a list of nodes that have exactly one connection in the tree. `dist1` is the shortest distance from `start` to the first node in `leaves` as calculated by the `bfs` function. `dist2` is the shortest distance from `start` to the second node in `leaves` as calculated by the `bfs` function. Both `dist1` and `dist2` are even numbers.**
