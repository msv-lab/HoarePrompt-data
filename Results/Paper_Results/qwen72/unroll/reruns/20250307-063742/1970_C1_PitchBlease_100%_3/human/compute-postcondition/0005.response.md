The function `bfs` accepts two parameters: `start` and `target`. Both `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in a tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. The tree is represented as a dictionary or adjacency list, where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors. The function returns -1 if the target node is not reachable from the start node in the tree.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `start` and `target` representing node indices in a tree and returns -1 if the target node is not reachable from the start node.**
