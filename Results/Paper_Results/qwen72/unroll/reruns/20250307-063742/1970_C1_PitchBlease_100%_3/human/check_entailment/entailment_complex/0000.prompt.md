Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

# Annotated Functions:
from collections import deque, defaultdict

(n, t) = map(int, input().split())
edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
starts = list(map(int, input().split()))
start = starts[0]
print(func_1(n, edges, start))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, edges is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n and each tuple represents an edge in the tree, and start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `tree` is a defaultdict of type list where each key is an integer from 1 to n, and the value for each key is a list of integers representing the nodes directly connected to that key by an edge in the tree. The lists are populated based on the edges provided, and each edge (u, v) is represented twice: once in `tree[u]` and once in `tree[v]`. The variables `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 1 or dist2 % 2 == 1) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n`, a list of tuples `edges`, and an integer `start`. It constructs a tree representation from the `edges` and identifies the leaves of the tree. The function then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the `start` node to the first two leaves found. If the distance from `start` to either of the first two leaves is odd, the function returns 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns 'Hermione'. The input parameters `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged after the function execution.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n, and the tree is represented as a dictionary or adjacency list where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The `queue` will be empty, and `visited` will contain all the nodes that were reachable from `start` in the tree, including `start` itself. The loop returns the shortest distance `dist` from `start` to `target` if `target` is reachable, otherwise, the loop would have exited with `queue` empty and `dist` not returned.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node is not reachable from the start node in the tree.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `bfs` accepts two integers `start` and `target` representing node indices in a tree. It performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is reachable from the `start` node, the function returns the shortest distance as an integer. If the `target` node is not reachable, the function returns -1. The function does not modify the tree or any external state.
