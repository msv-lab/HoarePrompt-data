Output State: **The `queue` will be empty, and `visited` will contain all the nodes that were reachable from `start` in the tree, including `start` itself. The loop returns the shortest distance `dist` from `start` to `target` if `target` is reachable, otherwise, the loop would have exited with `queue` empty and `dist` not returned.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes executing, the `queue` will be empty because all nodes that could be visited have been processed. The `visited` set will include all the nodes that were reachable from the starting node `start`, including `start` itself. If the `target` node was found, the loop would have returned the shortest distance `dist` from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node was not found, the loop would have exited with the `queue` empty, and no distance would have been returned.
