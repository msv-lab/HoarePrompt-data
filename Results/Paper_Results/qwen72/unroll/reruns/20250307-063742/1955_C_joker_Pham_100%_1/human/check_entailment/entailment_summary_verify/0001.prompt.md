You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of elements in the list), `k` (a positive integer), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers). It processes the list `a` by reducing the values of its elements based on the available value of `k`. The function returns the number of elements that have been fully processed, meaning their values have been reduced to zero or removed from the list. After the function concludes, `l` is greater than `r`, `sunks` is the count of fully processed elements, and `k` is the remaining value after the operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - The first line contains two integers `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
     - The second line contains `n` integers representing the durability of each ship.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken.

3. **Behavior:**
   - The Kraken attacks the first ship, then the last ship, and repeats this pattern.
   - Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1.
   - If a ship's durability reaches 0, it sinks and is no longer attacked.
   - The process continues until all ships have sunk or the Kraken has made `k` attacks.

### Program Analysis:
The program is structured as follows:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes `n`, `k`, and the list `a` as arguments.
   - It initializes two pointers `l` (left) and `r` (right) to the first and last indices of the list `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `k` is 0. If so, it breaks the loop.
   - If `l` equals `r`, it means there is only one ship left. If `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of this ship, the ship sinks, and the loop breaks.
   - If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, it handles the attacks on the first and last ships:
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[l]`, it subtracts `2 * a[l]` from `k`, reduces the durability of the last ship by `a[l]`, and updates the pointers and `sunks` accordingly.
     - If `k` is exactly `2 * a[l] - 1`, it means the last ship will sink after the next attack, so it increments `sunks` and breaks the loop.
     - If neither condition is met, it breaks the loop.
   - If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, it handles the attacks on the last and first ships similarly:
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[r]`, it subtracts `2 * a[r]` from `k`, reduces the durability of the first ship by `a[r]`, and updates the pointers and `sunks` accordingly.
     - If `k` is exactly `2 * a[r]`, it means the first ship will sink after the next attack, so it increments `sunks` and breaks the loop.
     - If neither condition is met, it breaks the loop.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Handling of Single Ship:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where there is only one ship left (`l == r`).

2. **Handling of Multiple Ships:**
   - The program correctly reduces the durability of the ships and updates the pointers and `sunks` counter.
   - However, the logic for handling the attacks is overly complex and can be simplified. The current logic has multiple break statements and conditions that can be merged for clarity.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle cases where `k` is less than the total number of attacks needed to sink all ships.
   - The program should also handle cases where `k` is exactly enough to sink a specific number of ships.

4. **Simplification:**
   - The logic can be simplified by using a more straightforward approach to simulate the attacks and count the number of ships sunk.

### Simplified Approach:
- Use a while loop to simulate the attacks.
- Decrement the durability of the first and last ships alternately.
- If a ship's durability reaches 0, increment the `sunks` counter and adjust the pointers.
- Continue until `k` attacks are made or all ships have sunk.

### Conclusion:
The given program is logically correct but can be simplified for better readability and maintainability. However, it does handle the problem as described and should produce the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
