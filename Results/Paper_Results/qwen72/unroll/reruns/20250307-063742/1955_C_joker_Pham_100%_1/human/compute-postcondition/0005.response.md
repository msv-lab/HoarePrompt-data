The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `a`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`. `k` is a positive integer where `1 <= k <= 10^15`. `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, each element `a_i` satisfying `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`.

The function returns the number of elements that have been fully processed (either removed or reduced to zero) from the list `a`.
