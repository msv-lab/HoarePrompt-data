### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`, and then the list `a` of ship durabilities.

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the appropriate arguments for each test case.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the list `a`, respectively, and a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.
   - **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`, which ensures that the function processes the ships from both ends until there are no more ships to attack.
   - **Single Ship Case**: If `l` equals `r`, it means there is only one ship left. The function checks if the remaining attacks `k` are enough to sink this ship. If so, it increments the `sunks` counter and breaks out of the loop.
   - **Attacking from Both Ends**:
     - If the durability of the ship at the left end (`a[l]`) is less than or equal to the durability of the ship at the right end (`a[r]`), the function checks if `k` is sufficient to attack both ships. If `k` is enough to attack both ships, it reduces `k` by `2 * a[l]`, reduces `a[r]` by `a[l]`, and increments the `sunks` counter. If `a[r]` becomes zero, it is considered sunk, and the right pointer `r` is decremented.
     - If the durability of the ship at the right end (`a[r]`) is less than the durability of the ship at the left end (`a[l]`), the function checks if `k` is sufficient to attack both ships. If `k` is enough to attack both ships, it reduces `k` by `2 * a[r]`, reduces `a[l]` by `a[r]`, and increments the `sunks` counter. If `a[l]` becomes zero, it is considered sunk, and the left pointer `l` is incremented.
   - **Break Conditions**: The function breaks out of the loop if `k` becomes zero or if the remaining attacks are not enough to sink the current ship being attacked.

4. **Output**: The function returns the number of ships sunk, which is stored in the `sunks` counter.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The function correctly handles the case where there is only one ship left.
- The function correctly reduces the durability of the ships and updates the pointers and the remaining attacks `k`.
- The function correctly increments the `sunks` counter when a ship is sunk.
- The function correctly breaks out of the loop when `k` becomes zero or when the remaining attacks are not enough to sink the current ship.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Ship**: The function correctly handles the case where there is only one ship.
- **All Ships Sunk**: The function correctly handles the case where all ships are sunk.
- **No Ships Sunk**: The function correctly handles the case where no ships are sunk.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It processes the ships in the correct order, updates the durabilities and remaining attacks, and correctly counts the number of ships sunk.
