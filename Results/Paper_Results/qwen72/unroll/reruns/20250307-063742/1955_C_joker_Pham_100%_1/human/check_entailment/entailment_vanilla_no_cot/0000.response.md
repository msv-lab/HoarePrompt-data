Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Attacks on the First and Last Ship**: The program attempts to handle attacks on both the first and last ship in a single iteration, which is incorrect. The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship, and the program should reflect this behavior.

2. **Redundant Checks**: The program has redundant checks for `if k == 0` within the loop, which can be simplified. The loop should naturally break when `k` is exhausted.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Sinking Ships**: The logic for determining when a ship sinks and adjusting the indices `l` and `r` is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the case where the Kraken attacks the first ship and then the last ship in a single iteration, which can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when `k` is very large and all ships are sunk, or when `k` is small and only a few ships are sunk.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while k > 0 and l <= r:
        if l == r:
            if k >= a[l]:
                sunks += 1
            break
        if k >= a[l]:
            k -= a[l]
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
        else:
            break
        if k >= a[r]:
            k -= a[r]
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
        else:
            break
    return sunks

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, k, a))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**: Initialize `l` and `r` to point to the first and last ship, respectively, and `sunks` to count the number of sunk ships.
2. **Main Loop**: The loop continues as long as there are ships left to attack (`l <= r`) and the Kraken has attacks remaining (`k > 0`).
3. **First Ship Attack**: If the Kraken has enough attacks to sink the first ship, it does so, reduces `k` by the durability of the first ship, increments `l`, and increments the sink count.
4. **Last Ship Attack**: Similarly, if the Kraken has enough attacks to sink the last ship, it does so, reduces `k` by the durability of the last ship, decrements `r`, and increments the sink count.
5. **Break Conditions**: The loop breaks if the Kraken runs out of attacks or if there are no more ships to attack.

This corrected program should handle all the test cases correctly and efficiently.
