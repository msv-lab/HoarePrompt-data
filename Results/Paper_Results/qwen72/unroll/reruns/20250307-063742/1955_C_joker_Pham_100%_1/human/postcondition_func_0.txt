The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of elements in the list), `k` (a positive integer), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers). It processes the list `a` by reducing the values of its elements based on the available value of `k`. The function returns the number of elements that have been fully processed, meaning their values have been reduced to zero or removed from the list. After the function concludes, `l` is greater than `r`, `sunks` is the count of fully processed elements, and `k` is the remaining value after the operations.
