The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. The variable `cnt` is not part of the loop head, so it cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for the loop to start, `i` should be initialized to 1, and `m` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1**
