### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\) and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The state after the function call is that \(a\) is the GCD of the initial values of \(a\) and \(b\), and \(b\) is 0.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The loop iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\).
   - It then increments `cnt` by \(\left\lceil \frac{x}{y} \right\rceil\) plus 1 if \(x\) is exactly divisible by \(y\).

4. **Mathematical Analysis**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer \(k\).
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - For \(a\) to be a positive integer, \(k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1\) must be a positive integer, and \(a\) must be less than or equal to \(n\).

5. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop in `func_2` is trying to count the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\).
   - The expression \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\) is derived from the condition:
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1) \le n
     \]
     which simplifies to:
     \[
     k \cdot \gcd(a, b) \le \frac{n + b}{b}
     \]
   - The loop then counts the number of valid \(k\) values, which is \(\left\lceil \frac{x}{y} \right\rceil\) plus 1 if \(x\) is exactly divisible by \(y\).

6. **Initial Value of `cnt`**:
   - The initial value of `cnt` is set to -1, which is incorrect. It should be initialized to 0 because we are counting the number of valid pairs, and the count should start from 0.

7. **Correctness of the Loop**:
   - The loop logic is flawed. The expression \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\) does not correctly capture the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The correct approach should involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition directly.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because the loop logic and the initial value of `cnt` do not correctly implement the required condition for counting valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
