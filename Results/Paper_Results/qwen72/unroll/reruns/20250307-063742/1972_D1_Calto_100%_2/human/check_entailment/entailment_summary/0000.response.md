Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers \(a\) and \(b\). It uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is a well-known and efficient method for finding the GCD.
   - **`func_2(n, m)`**: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. However, the logic in `func_2` does not seem to align with the problem description.

3. **Detailed Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - The function initializes `cnt` to -1, which is unusual and suggests a potential off-by-one error.
   - It iterates over `i` from 1 to `m` inclusive.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `x` as \(n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and `y` as \(i \cdot i\).
   - It updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y)` and 1 if `x % y == 0`.

4. **Logical Issues**:
   - The calculation of `x` and `y` does not directly relate to the conditions \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The use of `math.ceil(x / y)` and the condition `x % y == 0` does not seem to correctly count the valid pairs.
   - The initialization of `cnt` to -1 and the subsequent addition of 1 for each valid pair is incorrect and will result in an off-by-one error.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be done by iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition for each pair.

Given the logical issues and the incorrect approach in `func_2`, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
