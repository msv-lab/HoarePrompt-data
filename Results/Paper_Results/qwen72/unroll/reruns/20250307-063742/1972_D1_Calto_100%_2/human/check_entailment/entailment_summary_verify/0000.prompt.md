You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) and returns an integer `cnt`. The value of `cnt` is computed by iterating through the range from 1 to `m` inclusive, where for each iteration, it calculates a value based on `n` and the current iteration index `i`, and updates `cnt` accordingly. After the loop completes, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the function returns the final value of `cnt`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). The function `func_2` seems to be attempting to solve the problem, but it does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description.

For example, consider the input (n=2, m=3). The correct output should be 3, as the valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2). However, the function `func_2` returns 4, which is incorrect.

Let's break down the logic in `func_2`:

1. The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`.
2. It calculates `x` and `y` in a way that does not directly relate to the conditions specified in the problem.
3. The expression `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is used to update the count, but this does not correctly reflect the condition that `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds for each pair. The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
