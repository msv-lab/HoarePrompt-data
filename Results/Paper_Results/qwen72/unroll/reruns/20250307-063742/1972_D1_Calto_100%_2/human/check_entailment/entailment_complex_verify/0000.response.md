### Reasoning

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Analysis of `func_1`

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
  - The state annotations are correct: `a` and `b` are positive integers, and after the loop, `a` holds the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`, while `b` is 0.
  - This function is not used in the main logic of the program, but it is correct.

#### Analysis of `func_2`

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - The function iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`.
  - It calculates `x` and `y` as follows:
    - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
    - `y = i * i`
  - It updates `cnt` using the expression `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

However, the logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the required conditions:

1. **Calculation of `x` and `y`**:
   - The expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not directly relate to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The values of `x` and `y` are derived in a way that does not reflect the problem's requirements.

2. **Update of `cnt`**:
   - The expression `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is used to update the count, but this does not correctly reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The use of `math.ceil(x / y)` and the check `(x % y == 0)` are not aligned with the problem's conditions.

#### Example Verification

Let's consider the example input \((n=2, m=3)\):

- The correct output should be 3, as the valid pairs are \((1,1)\), \((2,1)\), and \((2,2)\).
- However, the function `func_2` returns 4, which is incorrect.

#### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

1. Iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. For each pair, compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

The current implementation in `func_2` does not follow this approach and instead uses a different, incorrect logic.
