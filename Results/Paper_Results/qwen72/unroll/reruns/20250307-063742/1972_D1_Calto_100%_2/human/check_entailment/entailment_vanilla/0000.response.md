Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\). It uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is correct for finding the GCD.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.

Let's break down `func_2(n, m)`:
- The function initializes `cnt` to -1.
- It iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
- For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (b \cdot b - b)\) and \(y = b \cdot b\).
- It then updates `cnt` by adding \(\left\lceil \frac{x}{y} \right\rceil\) and 1 if \(x \% y == 0\).

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Initialization of `cnt`**:
   - The initialization of `cnt` to -1 is incorrect. The count of valid pairs should start from 0, not -1.
   
2. **Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**:
   - The expression \(x = n - (b \cdot b - b)\) and \(y = b \cdot b\) does not align with the problem's requirement. The problem requires \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but the program is not correctly implementing this condition.

3. **Update of `cnt`**:
   - The update `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is not correct for the given problem. This update is based on a different logic and does not ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. For each \(b\), iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

However, this brute-force approach is inefficient for large values of \(n\) and \(m\). A more efficient approach involves:
1. For each \(b\), find the possible values of \(a\) that satisfy the condition.
2. Use the properties of GCD and multiples to optimize the counting.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The initialization of `cnt` and the calculations within the loop do not align with the problem's conditions.

Correctness: **False**
