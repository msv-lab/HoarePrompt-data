### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program:

1. **Initialization of `cnt`**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that initializing `cnt` to -1 is incorrect. The count of valid pairs should start from 0, not -1. This is a clear mistake in the program.

2. **Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**:
   - The original assessment correctly states that the expressions \(x = n - (b \cdot b - b)\) and \(y = b \cdot b\) do not align with the problem's requirement. The problem requires \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but the program is using a different and incorrect logic.

3. **Update of `cnt`**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the update `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is not correct for the given problem. This update is based on a different logic and does not ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. For each \(b\), iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

However, this brute-force approach is inefficient for large values of \(n\) and \(m\). A more efficient approach involves:
1. For each \(b\), find the possible values of \(a\) that satisfy the condition.
2. Use the properties of GCD and multiples to optimize the counting.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The initialization of `cnt` and the calculations within the loop do not align with the problem's conditions. The function `func_2` is fundamentally flawed and does not solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
