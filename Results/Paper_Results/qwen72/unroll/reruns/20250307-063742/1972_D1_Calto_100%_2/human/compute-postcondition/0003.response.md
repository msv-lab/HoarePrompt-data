Output State: **The program returns the value of `cnt` which is the result of the loop's computation.**

In natural language: The program returns the value of `cnt`, which has been computed through a loop. The specific value of `cnt` depends on the loop's operations and the initial values of `n` and `m`, but since the initial state only mentions that `cnt` will be the result of the loop's computation, the exact value of `cnt` is not specified.
