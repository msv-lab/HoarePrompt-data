You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) and returns an integer `cnt`. The value of `cnt` is computed by iterating through the range from 1 to `m` inclusive, where for each iteration, it calculates a value based on `n` and the current iteration index `i`, and updates `cnt` accordingly. After the loop completes, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the function returns the final value of `cnt`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\). It uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is correct for finding the GCD.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.

Let's break down `func_2(n, m)`:
- The function initializes `cnt` to -1.
- It iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
- For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (b \cdot b - b)\) and \(y = b \cdot b\).
- It then updates `cnt` by adding \(\left\lceil \frac{x}{y} \right\rceil\) and 1 if \(x \% y == 0\).

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Initialization of `cnt`**:
   - The initialization of `cnt` to -1 is incorrect. The count of valid pairs should start from 0, not -1.
   
2. **Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**:
   - The expression \(x = n - (b \cdot b - b)\) and \(y = b \cdot b\) does not align with the problem's requirement. The problem requires \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but the program is not correctly implementing this condition.

3. **Update of `cnt`**:
   - The update `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is not correct for the given problem. This update is based on a different logic and does not ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. For each \(b\), iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

However, this brute-force approach is inefficient for large values of \(n\) and \(m\). A more efficient approach involves:
1. For each \(b\), find the possible values of \(a\) that satisfy the condition.
2. Use the properties of GCD and multiples to optimize the counting.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The initialization of `cnt` and the calculations within the loop do not align with the problem's conditions.
