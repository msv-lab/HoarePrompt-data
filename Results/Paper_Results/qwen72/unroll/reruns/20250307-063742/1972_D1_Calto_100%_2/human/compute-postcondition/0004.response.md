The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers with the constraint that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. After executing the function body, the function returns the value of `cnt`, which is the result of the loop's computation.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) and returns the result of a computation performed in a loop, stored in the variable `cnt`.**
