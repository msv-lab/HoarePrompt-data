The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) and returns an integer `cnt`. The value of `cnt` is computed by iterating through the range from 1 to `m` inclusive, where for each iteration, it calculates a value based on `n` and the current iteration index `i`, and updates `cnt` accordingly. After the loop completes, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the function returns the final value of `cnt`.
