Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). The function `func_2` seems to be attempting to solve the problem, but it does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description.

For example, consider the input (n=2, m=3). The correct output should be 3, as the valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2). However, the function `func_2` returns 4, which is incorrect.

Let's break down the logic in `func_2`:

1. The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`.
2. It calculates `x` and `y` in a way that does not directly relate to the conditions specified in the problem.
3. The expression `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is used to update the count, but this does not correctly reflect the condition that `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds for each pair. The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
