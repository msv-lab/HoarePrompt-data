Reasoning: 

The original assessment is correct. The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The state annotations for `func_1` are accurate: `a` becomes the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` becomes 0.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`.
   - It calculates `x` and `y` as follows:
     - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
     - `y = i * i`
   - It updates `cnt` using the expression `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

However, this logic does not align with the problem requirements:
- The problem requires counting pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- The current implementation of `func_2` does not check the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for any pair `(a, b)`.
- Instead, it performs some arithmetic operations that do not directly relate to the problem's conditions.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`.
2. For each pair, compute `gcd(a, b)`.
3. Check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
4. Count the number of pairs that satisfy this condition.

The current implementation of `func_2` does not perform these steps, leading to incorrect results.

For example, with the input `(n=2, m=3)`, the correct pairs are `(1,1)`, `(2,1)`, and `(2,2)`. The function `func_2` returns 4, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
