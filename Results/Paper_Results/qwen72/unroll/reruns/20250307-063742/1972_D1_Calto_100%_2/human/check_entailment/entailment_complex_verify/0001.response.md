### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. The annotations confirm that the function returns the GCD of the initial values of \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **`func_2(n, m)`**: This function is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. Let's break down the logic:
   - **Initialization of `cnt`**: The variable `cnt` is initialized to -1. This is incorrect because the count of valid pairs should start from 0.
   - **Loop over \(b\)**: The function iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - **Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**: For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (b \cdot b - b)\) and \(y = b \cdot b\). This calculation does not align with the problem's requirement. The problem requires \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but the program is not correctly implementing this condition.
   - **Update of `cnt`**: The update `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is based on a different logic and does not ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program before `func_2(n, m)`**: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).
- **Loop behavior**: The loop iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m\). For each \(b\), it calculates \(x\) and \(y\) and updates `cnt` based on these values.
- **Output state**: The function returns the value of `cnt` after the loop completes.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. For each \(b\), find the possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. Count the number of valid pairs.

A more efficient approach involves:
1. For each \(b\), find the possible values of \(a\) that satisfy the condition using the properties of GCD and multiples.
2. Use mathematical insights to optimize the counting process.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The initialization of `cnt` to -1 and the calculations within the loop do not align with the problem's conditions. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
