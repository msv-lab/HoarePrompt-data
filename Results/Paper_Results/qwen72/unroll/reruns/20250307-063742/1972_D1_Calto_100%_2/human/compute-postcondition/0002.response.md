To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the loop step-by-step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
   - `cnt` is -1.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = m`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `x` is calculated as \( n - (i^2 - i) \).
     - `y` is calculated as \( i^2 \).
     - `cnt` is updated by adding `math.ceil(x / y)` and `1` if `x % y == 0`.

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - For each iteration `i`, `x` is the value of `n` minus a quadratic term \( i^2 - i \).
   - `y` is the square of `i`.
   - `math.ceil(x / y)` calculates the ceiling of the division of `x` by `y`.
   - `x % y == 0` checks if `x` is divisible by `y`, and if so, adds 1 to `cnt`.

4. **Output State Calculation:**
   - After the loop, `cnt` will be the sum of `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`.
   - The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged because they are not modified inside the loop.

5. **Final Output State:**
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `cnt` will be the result of the loop's computation.

Given the initial state and the loop's behavior, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **`n` and `m` remain the same, and `cnt` is the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + (n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0` for all `i` from 1 to `m`.**
