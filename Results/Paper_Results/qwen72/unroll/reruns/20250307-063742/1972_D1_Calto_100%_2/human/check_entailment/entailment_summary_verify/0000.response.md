Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It is a standard and correct implementation of the gcd function.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`, which is correct in terms of iterating over possible values of `b`.
   - However, the calculations inside the loop are incorrect:
     - `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not seem to have any direct relationship to the problem's conditions.
     - The expression `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is used to update the count, but it does not correctly reflect the condition that `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
   - Iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m.
   - For each pair, compute `gcd(a, b)` using `func_1`.
   - Check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, increment the count.

The current implementation of `func_2` does not perform these steps correctly. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

Final: **False**
