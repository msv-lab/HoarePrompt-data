Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is intended to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`. It correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD.
   - However, the function is not used in `func_2`, which is the main function for solving the problem.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The logic in `func_2` is incorrect. Specifically, the expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not correctly capture the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:
- **GCD Calculation**: The `gcd` function correctly computes the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
- **Counting Valid Pairs**: The `count_valid_pairs` function iterates over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges and checks if the condition \((a + b) \% (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\) is satisfied. If it is, the pair \((a, b)\) is counted.
- **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `m` and printing the result of `count_valid_pairs(n, m)`.

This approach ensures that all valid pairs are correctly counted and the output matches the problem description.
