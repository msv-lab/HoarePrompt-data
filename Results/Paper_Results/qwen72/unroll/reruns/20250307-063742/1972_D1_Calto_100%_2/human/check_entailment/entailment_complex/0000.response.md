### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. The state comments are accurate, and the function works as intended.
   - **`func_2(n, m)`**: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. However, the logic inside the loop is not correct for the problem statement.

3. **Loop Analysis in `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - Inside the loop, the variables `x` and `y` are calculated as follows:
     - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
     - `y = i * i`
   - The variable `cnt` is updated by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
   - This logic does not correctly count the pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Correct Logic for `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - For each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), we need to count the number of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be simplified by noting that if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), then \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b\).
   - However, the current implementation does not follow this logic and instead uses a formula that does not align with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation of `func_2(n, m)` does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic inside the loop is flawed and does not count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as required.

### Correctness:
**False**
