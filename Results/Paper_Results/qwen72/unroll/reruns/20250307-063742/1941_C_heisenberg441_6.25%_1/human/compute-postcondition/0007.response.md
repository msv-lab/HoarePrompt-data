Output State: **s is a string with all occurrences of the substring 'pie' removed, and ans is the number of times 'pie' was removed from s.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'pie' is found in the string `s`.
- During each iteration, the loop finds the first occurrence of 'pie' in `s` and removes it by slicing the string before and after 'pie', effectively reducing the length of `s` by 2 characters each time 'pie' is found and removed.
- The variable `ans` is incremented by 1 each time 'pie' is removed, keeping track of the total number of times 'pie' was found and removed from `s`.
- The loop stops when there are no more occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.
- Therefore, after the loop finishes, `s` will be a string with all occurrences of 'pie' removed, and `ans` will be the number of times 'pie' was removed from `s`.
