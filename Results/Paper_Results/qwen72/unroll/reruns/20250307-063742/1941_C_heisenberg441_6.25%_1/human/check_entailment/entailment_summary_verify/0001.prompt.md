You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    if s == 'mapie':
        return 1
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns an integer. If the string `s` is exactly 'mapie', the function returns 1. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' from `s`, and returns the total number of times these substrings were removed. The final state of the program is that the string `s` has been modified to no longer contain these substrings, and the integer returned represents the count of removals.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - The program should handle multiple test cases, each with a different string `s`.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the string and the string `s` itself.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
   - The function starts with a special case check: if the string is exactly "mapie", it returns 1. This is a specific edge case that is not generally necessary for the solution, but it does not affect the correctness for other cases.
   - The function then uses a loop to find and remove occurrences of the substring "map" from the string `s`. Each time it finds "map", it removes the first two characters of "map" and increments the deletion count `ans`.
   - Similarly, it uses another loop to find and remove occurrences of the substring "pie" from the string `s`. Each time it finds "pie", it removes the first two characters of "pie" and increments the deletion count `ans`.

4. **Deletion Logic:**
   - The logic of removing the first two characters of "map" and "pie" is incorrect. To make the string beautiful, we should remove the entire substring "map" or "pie" each time it is found.
   - The correct approach should be to remove the entire substring "map" or "pie" and increment the deletion count by the length of the substring (3 characters).

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it only removes the first two characters of the substrings "map" and "pie" instead of the entire substrings. This will not always result in the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 3:]
        ans += 3
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 3:]
        ans += 3
    return ans
```

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
