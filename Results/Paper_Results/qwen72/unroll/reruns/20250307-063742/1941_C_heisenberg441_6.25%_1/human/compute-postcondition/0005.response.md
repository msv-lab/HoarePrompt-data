Output State: **s is a string with all occurrences of the substring 'map' removed, and ans is the number of times 'map' was removed from s.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the string `s` will no longer contain any instances of the substring 'map'. The variable `ans` will hold the count of how many times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s`.
