To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `s.find('pie') != -1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition in the Loop Head**: The loop will execute if `s.find('pie')` does not return `-1`. This means that the string `s` must contain the substring `'pie'` for the loop to execute.
2. **State Before the Loop**: The state provided is:
   - `s` is a string with all occurrences of the substring `'map'` removed.
   - `ans` is the number of times `'map'` was removed from `s`.

3. **Adjustment Needed**: For the loop to execute, `s` must contain the substring `'pie'`. The current state does not specify whether `s` contains `'pie'` or not. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `s` contains `'pie'`.

### Conclusion:
The state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `s` contains the substring `'pie'`.

State: **`s` is a string with all occurrences of the substring 'map' removed and `s` must contain the substring 'pie', `ans` is the number of times 'map' was removed from `s`**
