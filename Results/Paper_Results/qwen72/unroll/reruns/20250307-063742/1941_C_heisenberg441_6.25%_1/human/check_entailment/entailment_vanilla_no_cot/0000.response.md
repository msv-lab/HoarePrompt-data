Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it only handles specific cases of the substrings "map" and "pie" and does not correctly account for all possible positions of these substrings within the string. Additionally, the function `func_1` has a special case for the string "mapie" which is not necessary and does not handle all possible inputs correctly.

### Issues:
1. **Special Case Handling**: The function `func_1` has a special case for the string "mapie" which returns 1. This is not a general solution and will fail for other strings that contain "map" or "pie" but are not exactly "mapie".
2. **Incorrect Substring Removal**: The program removes only the first two characters of the substrings "map" and "pie" when found, which is incorrect. It should remove the entire substring to ensure the string becomes beautiful.
3. **Inefficient Looping**: The program uses a while loop to repeatedly find and remove substrings, which can be inefficient and may not handle overlapping substrings correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you should:
- Identify all occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie".
- Remove the minimum number of characters to ensure no occurrences of these substrings remain.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    # Initialize the count of characters to be removed
    ans = 0
    
    # Use regular expressions to find all overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie"
    import re
    matches = re.finditer(r'(?=map|pie)', s)
    
    # Create a list of positions where "map" or "pie" starts
    positions = [match.start() for match in matches]
    
    # Initialize the previous position to -1
    prev_pos = -1
    
    for pos in positions:
        if pos == prev_pos + 1:
            # If the current position is the next character after the previous position,
            # it means the substrings are overlapping, so we only need to remove one character
            ans += 1
        else:
            # Otherwise, we need to remove the entire substring
            ans += 3
        prev_pos = pos
    
    return ans
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Regular Expressions**: The `re.finditer` function is used to find all overlapping occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie".
- **Position Handling**: The program keeps track of the positions where these substrings start and ensures that overlapping substrings are handled correctly.
- **Character Removal**: For each non-overlapping occurrence, the program adds 3 to the count (since "map" and "pie" are 3 characters long). For overlapping occurrences, it adds only 1 to the count.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies and removes the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.
