Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of making a string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters to eliminate the substrings "pie" and "map". The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of deletions required to achieve this. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Special Case Handling**: The program checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie" and returns 1. This is incorrect because the problem does not specify any special handling for the exact string "mapie". Instead, the string "mapie" should be treated like any other string and should be processed to remove both "map" and "pie" substrings. For example, "mapie" should require 2 deletions to become "mie", which is beautiful.

2. **Substring Removal Logic**: The program attempts to remove "map" and "pie" substrings by replacing them with a modified string. However, the logic for removing "pie" is flawed. When removing "pie", the program only removes the first two characters of the substring, which is incorrect. The correct approach would be to remove all three characters of "pie" to ensure the substring is completely eliminated.

3. **Efficiency and Correctness**: The program uses a `while` loop to find and remove substrings, which is generally correct in terms of logic. However, the program should ensure that it correctly handles overlapping substrings and that it counts the total number of characters removed, not just the number of times the substrings are found.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 3:]  # Remove all 3 characters of 'map'
        ans += 3
        
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 3:]  # Remove all 3 characters of 'pie'
        ans += 3
        
    return ans
```

This corrected version ensures that all occurrences of "map" and "pie" are fully removed, and the count of characters removed is accurate.

Correctness: **False**
