Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` incorrectly processes the string by removing only the first two characters of the substrings "map" and "pie" when it finds them. This can lead to incorrect results in cases where the substrings overlap or where the removal of characters should be more carefully managed to minimize the number of deletions.

For example, consider the string "mappie". The program will first remove "map" and then "pie", resulting in the string "pie" and "m", respectively, and will output 2 deletions. However, the correct answer should be 3 deletions, as removing the characters at positions 1, 4, and 5 (0-based index) will make the string "ppe" which is beautiful.

Another example is the string "mapie". The program will output 1 deletion, but the correct answer should be 2 deletions, as removing the characters at positions 1 and 4 (0-based index) will make the string "mie" which is beautiful.

These cases demonstrate that the program does not always produce the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
