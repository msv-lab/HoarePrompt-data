### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - The program should handle multiple test cases, each with a different string `s`.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the string and the string `s` itself.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
   - The function starts with a special case check: if the string is exactly "mapie", it returns 1. This is a specific edge case that is not generally necessary for the solution, but it does not affect the correctness for other cases.
   - The function then uses a loop to find and remove occurrences of the substring "map" from the string `s`. Each time it finds "map", it removes the first two characters of "map" and increments the deletion count `ans`.
   - Similarly, it uses another loop to find and remove occurrences of the substring "pie" from the string `s`. Each time it finds "pie", it removes the first two characters of "pie" and increments the deletion count `ans`.

4. **Deletion Logic:**
   - The logic of removing the first two characters of "map" and "pie" is indeed incorrect. To make the string beautiful, we should remove the entire substring "map" or "pie" each time it is found.
   - The correct approach should be to remove the entire substring "map" or "pie" and increment the deletion count by the length of the substring (3 characters).

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the result for each test case, but the result is incorrect due to the flawed deletion logic.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **Initial State:**
  - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies \(1 \le n \le 10^6\).

- **Special Case Check:**
  - The check `if s == 'mapie': return 1` is a specific edge case and does not generally affect the correctness of the program for other cases. However, it is not necessary and can be removed for simplicity.

- **First Loop:**
  - The loop `while s.find('map') != -1:` correctly identifies the presence of the substring "map".
  - The line `s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]` only removes the first two characters of "map", which is incorrect.
  - The line `ans += 1` increments the deletion count by 1, which is also incorrect.

- **Second Loop:**
  - The loop `while s.find('pie') != -1:` correctly identifies the presence of the substring "pie".
  - The line `s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]` only removes the first two characters of "pie", which is incorrect.
  - The line `ans += 1` increments the deletion count by 1, which is also incorrect.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it only removes the first two characters of the substrings "map" and "pie" instead of the entire substrings. This results in an incorrect count of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

### Final Correctness:
Final: **False**
