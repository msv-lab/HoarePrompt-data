The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns an integer. If the string `s` is exactly 'mapie', the function returns 1. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' from `s`, and returns the total number of times these substrings were removed. The final state of the program is that the string `s` has been modified to no longer contain these substrings, and the integer returned represents the count of removals.
