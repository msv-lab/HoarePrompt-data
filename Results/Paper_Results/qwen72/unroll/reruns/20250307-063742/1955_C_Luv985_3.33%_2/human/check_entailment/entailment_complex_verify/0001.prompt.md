You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It modifies the list `a` by reducing pairs of elements from the ends of the list until the sum of the reductions equals `k` or no more pairs can be reduced. The function then prints the number of elements in the list `a` that have been reduced to zero. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the variable `T` is 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the durability of each ship and converts them to integers.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the first and last ship, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `ans` to keep track of the number of sunk ships.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The program uses a while loop to simulate the Kraken's attacks. The loop continues as long as there are ships left to attack (`l < r`) and there are attacks remaining (`k > 0`).
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the minimum durability between the first and last ship (`mi`).
   - If the Kraken can attack both ships without running out of attacks (`mi * 2 <= k`), it reduces the durability of both ships by `mi` and decreases `k` by `2 * mi`.
   - If the durability of the first ship drops to zero, it increments the `ans` counter and moves the left pointer `l` to the next ship.
   - If the durability of the last ship drops to zero, it increments the `ans` counter and moves the right pointer `r` to the previous ship.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If the Kraken cannot attack both ships in one go (`mi * 2 > k`), it calculates the remaining attacks and checks if the last ship can be sunk with the remaining attacks.
   - If the remaining attacks are enough to sink the last ship, it increments the `ans` counter and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Single Ship Case:**
   - After the main loop, if there is only one ship left (`l == r`), it checks if the remaining attacks are enough to sink this single ship. If so, it increments the `ans` counter.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of sunk ships for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correctness of the Main Loop:**
  - The main loop correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks by alternating between the first and last ships.
  - It correctly handles the case where the Kraken can attack both ships in one go and updates the pointers and the counter accordingly.
  - The edge case handling for when the Kraken cannot attack both ships in one go is also correct.

- **Single Ship Case:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where only one ship is left and checks if the remaining attacks are enough to sink it.

- **Overall Logic:**
  - The logic of the program aligns with the problem description. It correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of sunk ships.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.

Correctness: **True**
