The provided code snippet consists of comments and does not contain any executable Python code that would modify the state of the variables. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, or the list `a` are affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.**
