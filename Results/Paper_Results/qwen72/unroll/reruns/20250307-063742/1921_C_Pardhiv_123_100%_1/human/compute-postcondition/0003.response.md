Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by four integers (n, f, a, b) and a list of n integers (m_1, m_2, ..., m_n). It returns the minimum total charge consumption required to send all messages in each test case, considering the initial phone charge, charge consumption per unit of time, and the consumption when the phone is turned off and on sequentially.**
