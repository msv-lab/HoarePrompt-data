### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It reads the list of moments `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` and prepends a 0 to it to handle the initial state at moment 0.

2. **Charge Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through each message moment and calculates the remaining charge `f` after sending each message.
   - It uses the formula `f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)` to determine the charge consumption. This formula ensures that Stepan either keeps the phone on and loses `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` units of charge or turns it off and on, losing `b` units of charge.
   - The `min` function ensures that Stepan chooses the action that minimizes the charge loss.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all messages for a test case, the program checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0.
   - If `f > 0`, it prints "YES".
   - If `f <= 0`, it prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `t` is 0 by breaking out of the loop.
   - It also handles the case where the initial charge `f` is very large and the message moments are very far apart, ensuring that there is no integer overflow in the charge calculation.

5. **Logical Flow:**
   - The program correctly processes each test case independently.
   - The charge calculation is done in a way that ensures the phone can be turned off and on without affecting the message sending moments.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly handles the charge consumption for both keeping the phone on and turning it off and on, and it correctly determines whether Stepan can send all messages based on the remaining charge.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
