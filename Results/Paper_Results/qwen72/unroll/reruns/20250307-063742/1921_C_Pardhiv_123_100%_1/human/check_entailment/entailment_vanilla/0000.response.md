### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of messages, initial charge, charge consumption per unit of time, and charge consumption for turning off and on the phone, respectively.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers `ls` representing the moments at which messages need to be sent.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes `ls` with a leading zero, which represents the initial moment (0).

3. **Charge Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through each message moment from 1 to `n`.
   - For each message, it calculates the charge loss by comparing two values:
     - `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`: The charge lost if the phone remains on from the previous message to the current message.
     - `b`: The charge lost if the phone is turned off and then on again.
   - It subtracts the minimum of these two values from the current charge `f`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all messages, the program checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0.
   - If `f > 0`, it prints "YES" indicating that Stepan can send all messages.
   - If `f <= 0`, it prints "NO" indicating that Stepan cannot send all messages.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the initial charge `f` is sufficient to send all messages without turning off the phone.
   - It also handles the case where turning off and on the phone is more efficient than keeping it on continuously.

6. **Integer Overflow:**
   - The program uses Python's built-in integer type, which can handle large numbers without overflow, as long as the values are within the limits of the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- The charge calculation logic is sound and follows the problem description.
- The program ensures that the phone is turned off and on only when necessary to minimize charge loss.
- The output is correctly formatted and matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
