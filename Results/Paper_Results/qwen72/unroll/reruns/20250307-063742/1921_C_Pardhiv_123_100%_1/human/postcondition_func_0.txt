The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by four integers (n, f, a, b) and a list of n integers (m_1, m_2, ..., m_n). For each test case, it determines whether the initial phone charge (f) is sufficient to send all messages at the specified moments (m_1, m_2, ..., m_n), considering the charge consumption per unit of time (a) and the charge consumption when the phone is turned off and on sequentially (b). If the charge is sufficient, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` equal to 0.
