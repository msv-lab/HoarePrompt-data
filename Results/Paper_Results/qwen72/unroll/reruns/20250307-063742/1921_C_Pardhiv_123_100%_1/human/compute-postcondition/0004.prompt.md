You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains four integers n, f, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of messages, the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially. Each test case also contains a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        
        ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: t = 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by four integers (n, f, a, b) and a list of n integers (m_1, m_2, ..., m_n). It returns the minimum total charge consumption required to send all messages in each test case, considering the initial phone charge, charge consumption per unit of time, and the consumption when the phone is turned off and on sequentially.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
