### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` and the list of `n` integers `ls` representing the moments at which messages need to be sent.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes `ls` with a leading zero, which represents the initial moment (0). This is a good approach as it simplifies the calculation of charge loss from the initial moment to the first message.

3. **Charge Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through each message moment from 1 to `n`.
   - For each message, it calculates the charge loss by comparing two values:
     - `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`: The charge lost if the phone remains on from the previous message to the current message.
     - `b`: The charge lost if the phone is turned off and then on again.
   - It subtracts the minimum of these two values from the current charge `f`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all messages, the program checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0.
   - If `f > 0`, it prints "YES" indicating that Stepan can send all messages.
   - If `f <= 0`, it prints "NO" indicating that Stepan cannot send all messages.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the initial charge `f` is sufficient to send all messages without turning off the phone.
   - It also handles the case where turning off and on the phone is more efficient than keeping it on continuously.

6. **Integer Overflow:**
   - The program uses Python's built-in integer type, which can handle large numbers without overflow, as long as the values are within the limits of the problem description. Python's integers are arbitrary precision and do not overflow.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- The charge calculation logic is sound and follows the problem description.
- The program ensures that the phone is turned off and on only when necessary to minimize charge loss.
- The output is correctly formatted and matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and should work as expected for the given problem description. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
