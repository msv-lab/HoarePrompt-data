### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` and a list of `n` integers `ls` representing the moments at which messages need to be sent.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes `ls` with a leading zero, which represents the initial moment (0). This is a good approach to simplify the charge calculation logic.

3. **Charge Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through each message moment from 1 to `n`.
   - For each message, it calculates the charge loss by comparing two values:
     - `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`: The charge lost if the phone remains on from the previous message to the current message.
     - `b`: The charge lost if the phone is turned off and then on again.
   - It subtracts the minimum of these two values from the current charge `f`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all messages, the program checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0.
   - If `f > 0`, it prints "YES" indicating that Stepan can send all messages.
   - If `f <= 0`, it prints "NO" indicating that Stepan cannot send all messages.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the initial charge `f` is sufficient to send all messages without turning off the phone.
   - It also handles the case where turning off and on the phone is more efficient than keeping it on continuously.

6. **Integer Overflow:**
   - The program uses Python's built-in integer type, which can handle large numbers without overflow, as long as the values are within the limits of the problem description. This is correct because Python's `int` type can handle arbitrarily large integers.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Correctness of Input Handling:**
  - The program reads the input correctly and processes each test case as expected.

- **Correctness of Charge Calculation:**
  - The charge calculation logic is sound. The program correctly calculates the minimum charge loss for each message interval and subtracts it from the current charge `f`.

- **Correctness of Output:**
  - The output is correctly formatted and matches the expected output format.

- **Handling of Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the initial charge is sufficient or where turning off and on the phone is more efficient.

- **Integer Overflow:**
  - The program does not suffer from integer overflow issues due to the use of Python's `int` type, which can handle large numbers.

### Annotated Code Review:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The program starts with `t` being an integer such that \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), representing the number of test cases.

- **Inside the function:**
  - `t = int(input(''))`: Reads the number of test cases.
  - `while t > 0:`: Processes each test case.
  - `n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))`: Reads the parameters for the current test case.
  - `ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))`: Reads the message moments and prepends a 0 to represent the initial moment.
  - `for i in range(1, n + 1):`: Iterates through each message moment.
  - `f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)`: Calculates the charge loss and updates `f`.
  - `if f > 0:`: Checks if the remaining charge is positive.
  - `print('YES')` or `print('NO')`: Outputs the result.
  - `t -= 1`: Decrements the test case counter.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and should work as expected for the given problem description. The original assessment was accurate.

Final: **True**
