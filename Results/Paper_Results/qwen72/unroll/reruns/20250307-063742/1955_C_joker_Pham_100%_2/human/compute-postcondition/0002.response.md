To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to check the condition in the loop head, which is `l <= r`. Given the initial state:

- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15.
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n` - 1.
- `sunks` is 0.

The variables `l` and `r` are the only ones that appear in the loop head condition. For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. 

Given that `l` is 0 and `r` is `n` - 1, and `n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5), `r` will always be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, the condition `l <= r` will always be true for the first iteration of the loop.

Since no adjustments are necessary, the state remains the same.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1, `sunks` is 0**
