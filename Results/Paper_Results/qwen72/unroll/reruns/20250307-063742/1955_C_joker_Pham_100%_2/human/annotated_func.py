    return sunks
    #The program returns the value of `sunks` which has been incremented based on the operations performed inside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns an integer `sunks`, which represents the number of operations performed to reduce `k` by subtracting elements from the list `a` under specific conditions. The function modifies the list `a` and the value of `k` during its execution. After the function concludes, `k` is reduced by a certain amount, and `sunks` is incremented based on the operations performed inside the loop. The final state of the program is such that `l` (the left index) is greater than `r` (the right index), and the list `a` may have some elements modified or reduced to zero.
