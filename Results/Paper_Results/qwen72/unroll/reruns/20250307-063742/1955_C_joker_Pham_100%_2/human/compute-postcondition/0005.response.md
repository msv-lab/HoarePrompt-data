The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `a`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`. `k` is a positive integer with a value between `1` and `10^15`. `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, each with a value between `1` and `10^9`. The function returns the value of `sunks`, which is incremented based on the operations performed inside the loop.
