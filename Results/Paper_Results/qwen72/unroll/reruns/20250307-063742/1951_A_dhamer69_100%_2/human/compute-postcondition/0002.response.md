Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, and the value of `t` is 0. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of the variable `t` is reduced to 0. The variables `start` and `end` are not modified within the loop, so they retain their initial values. The loop's behavior is determined by the inputs provided for `n` and `s` during each iteration, but the final state of the loop is simply that `t` has been decremented to 0, and the loop has stopped.
