The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraint that the current directory contains subfolders with names that can be interpreted as integers, and it assumes there are two integers, `start` and `end`, such that `start <= end`. The function returns a list of subfolder names (interpreted as integers) that are within the range `[start, end]`.

Functionality: **The function returns a list of subfolder names (interpreted as integers) within the current directory that fall within the range `[start, end]`, where `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`.**
