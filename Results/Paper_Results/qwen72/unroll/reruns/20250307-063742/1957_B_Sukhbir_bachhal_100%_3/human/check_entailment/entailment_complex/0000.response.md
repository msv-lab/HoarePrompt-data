Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Single Element Case**:
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `k`. This is correct because the only way to satisfy the conditions with a single element is to use `k` itself.

3. **Multiple Elements Case**:
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to determine the highest bit position in the binary representation of `k`.
   - The function `func_1` returns the position of the highest bit set in `k` minus 1. This is correct because it effectively finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - The program then appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the array `arr`. This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position found by `func_1`.
   - It appends `k - arr[-1]` to the array `arr`. This ensures that the sum of the elements in `arr` is `k`.
   - The remaining elements in `arr` are filled with 0s to ensure the array has `n` elements.

4. **Bitwise OR Maximization**:
   - The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - By setting the first element to `2 ** counter - 1`, the program ensures that all bits up to the highest bit position are set to 1.
   - The second element is set to `k - arr[-1]`, which ensures the sum is `k` and the remaining bits are set as needed to maximize the number of 1s in the OR result.
   - The rest of the elements are 0, which does not affect the bitwise OR result.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the highest bit position in the binary representation of `k`.
   - The function does not use the parameter `k` (which is not needed), but this does not affect the correctness of the program.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the sequence `arr` for each test case, which satisfies the conditions given in the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
