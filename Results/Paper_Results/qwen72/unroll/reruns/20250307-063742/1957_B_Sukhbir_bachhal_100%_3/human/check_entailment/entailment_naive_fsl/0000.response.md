Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n > 1` and `k` is less than the value of `2 ** counter - 1`. For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the program will incorrectly append `3` and `0` to the array, which does not maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. The correct output should be `1 2` or `2 1`, which both have the maximum number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.
