You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is an integer. It returns -1 if `n` is 0. Otherwise, it returns the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of `n` minus 1. The parameter `k` is not used in the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze it step by step based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
1. We need to construct a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) such that their sum is \( k \).
2. The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers should be maximized.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Sequence Construction:**
   - If \( n > 1 \):
     - It calls `func_1(k)` to determine the highest bit position set in \( k \).
     - It appends \( 2^{\text{counter}} - 1 \) to the array `arr`. This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of \( k \).
     - It appends \( k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) \) to the array `arr`. This ensures that the sum of the first two elements is \( k \).
     - It appends \( n - 2 \) zeros to the array `arr` to ensure the array has \( n \) elements.
     - It prints the array `arr`.
   - If \( n = 1 \):
     - It simply prints \( k \).

3. **Function `func_1(n)`:**
   - This function determines the highest bit position set in \( n \).
   - It initializes `position` to 0.
   - It shifts \( n \) right until \( n \) becomes 0, incrementing `position` each time.
   - It returns `position - 1`, which is the highest bit position set in \( n \).

### Correctness Verification:
1. **Sum Condition:**
   - For \( n > 1 \), the sum of the first two elements is \( (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) + (k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1)) = k \).
   - For \( n = 1 \), the sum is simply \( k \).
   - Both cases satisfy the sum condition.

2. **Maximizing the Number of 1s in the Binary Representation:**
   - For \( n > 1 \), the first element \( 2^{\text{counter}} - 1 \) has all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of \( k \).
   - The second element \( k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) \) ensures that the remaining value is added to the sequence.
   - The bitwise OR of \( 2^{\text{counter}} - 1 \) and \( k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) \) will have all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of \( k \), which is the maximum number of 1s possible.
   - The remaining \( n - 2 \) elements are zeros, which do not affect the bitwise OR result.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If \( k = 0 \), the program will correctly handle it by printing \( 0 \) for \( n = 1 \).
   - For \( n = 1 \), the program correctly prints \( k \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers that sum to \( k \) and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. Therefore, the program is correct.
