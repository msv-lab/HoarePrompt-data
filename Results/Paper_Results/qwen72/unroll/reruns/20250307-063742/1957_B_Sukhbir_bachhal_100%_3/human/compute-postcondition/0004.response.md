The only variables in the loop head are `n` and the condition `n != 0`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 0. This condition already ensures that `n` is not 0, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.

Therefore, the program state can remain as it is:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and `n` is not equal to 0; `position` is 0**
