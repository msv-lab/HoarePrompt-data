The function `func_1` is defined to accept two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. However, the provided function definition only includes `n`. The output of the function is always -1, regardless of the input values.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The function always returns -1.**
