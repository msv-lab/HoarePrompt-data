Output State: **position is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of `n`, and `n` is 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop finishes executing, `n` will be 0 because the loop continuously shifts `n` to the right by one bit until `n` becomes 0. The variable `position` will hold the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of `n`. For example, if `n` was initially 8 (which is `1000` in binary and has 4 bits), `position` will be 4 after the loop completes.
