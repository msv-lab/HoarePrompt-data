### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.
   - The sequence should maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in the sequence.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, it constructs a sequence where:
     - The first element is `2^counter - 1`, where `counter` is the highest bit position in the binary representation of `k`.
     - The second element is `k - (2^counter - 1)`.
     - The remaining `n-2` elements are 0.
   - If `n` is 1, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1(n)` returns the highest bit position in the binary representation of `n` minus 1.
   - This is achieved by right-shifting `n` until it becomes 0, counting the number of shifts.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Sum Condition**: The sum of the sequence is `k` because the first element is `2^counter - 1` and the second element is `k - (2^counter - 1)`, and the rest are 0.
   - **Maximize 1s in OR**:
     - The first element `2^counter - 1` is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the `counter`-th bit.
     - The second element `k - (2^counter - 1)` ensures that the sum is `k`.
     - The bitwise OR of the first element and the second element will have the maximum number of 1s because the first element already has all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of `k`.
     - The remaining elements being 0 do not affect the OR result.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n` is 1, the program correctly prints `k`, which is the only possible sequence.
   - When `n` is greater than 1, the program ensures that the sum is `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the OR result by using the highest bit position of `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the sequence for each test case, ensuring that the sum is `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.

**Correctness: True**
