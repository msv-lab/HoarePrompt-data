### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Sequence Construction:**
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program calls `func_1(k)` to determine the highest bit position that can be set to 1 in the binary representation of `k`.
   - It then appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the array `arr`. This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position determined by `func_1(k)`.
   - It appends `k - arr[-1]` to the array `arr`, which ensures that the sum of the elements in `arr` is `k`.
   - It appends `n - 2` zeros to the array `arr` to ensure the array has `n` elements.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `arr` for each test case, which should satisfy the conditions given in the problem.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find the highest bit position that is set to 1 in the binary representation of `k`.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `n` is 0 by returning -1, but this case is not relevant to the problem since `k` is always at least 1.
   - The function iterates through the bits of `k` by right-shifting `n` until it becomes 0, and it returns the position of the highest bit set to 1, which is `position - 1`.

### Issues:
- **Function Definition:**
  - The function `func_1` is defined with only one parameter `n`, but the problem description suggests that it should be called with `k`. This is a minor issue since the function is only used with `k` and not `n`.
  - The function returns -1 when `n` is 0, but this case is not relevant to the problem since `k` is always at least 1.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1 by simply printing `k`.
  - For `n > 1`, the program constructs the sequence such that the sum is `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation. It correctly constructs the sequence for each test case and ensures that the sum of the elements is `k` while maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
