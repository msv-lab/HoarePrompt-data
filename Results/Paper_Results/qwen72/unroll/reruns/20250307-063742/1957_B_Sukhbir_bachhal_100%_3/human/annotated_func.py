#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition provided is incomplete. The correct function definition should include both parameters n and k. The correct precondition is: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1.
    #State: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and n is not equal to 0.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: position is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of `n`, and `n` is 0.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is an integer. It returns -1 if `n` is 0. Otherwise, it returns the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of `n` minus 1. The parameter `k` is not used in the function.
