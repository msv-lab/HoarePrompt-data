To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze it step by step based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
1. We need to construct a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) such that their sum is \( k \).
2. The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers should be maximized.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Sequence Construction:**
   - If \( n > 1 \):
     - It calls `func_1(k)` to determine the highest bit position set in \( k \).
     - It appends \( 2^{\text{counter}} - 1 \) to the array `arr`. This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of \( k \).
     - It appends \( k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) \) to the array `arr`. This ensures that the sum of the first two elements is \( k \).
     - It appends \( n - 2 \) zeros to the array `arr` to ensure the array has \( n \) elements.
     - It prints the array `arr`.
   - If \( n = 1 \):
     - It simply prints \( k \).

3. **Function `func_1(n)`:**
   - This function determines the highest bit position set in \( n \).
   - It initializes `position` to 0.
   - It shifts \( n \) right until \( n \) becomes 0, incrementing `position` each time.
   - It returns `position - 1`, which is the highest bit position set in \( n \).

### Correctness Verification:
1. **Sum Condition:**
   - For \( n > 1 \), the sum of the first two elements is \( (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) + (k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1)) = k \).
   - For \( n = 1 \), the sum is simply \( k \).
   - Both cases satisfy the sum condition.

2. **Maximizing the Number of 1s in the Binary Representation:**
   - For \( n > 1 \), the first element \( 2^{\text{counter}} - 1 \) has all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of \( k \).
   - The second element \( k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) \) ensures that the remaining value is added to the sequence.
   - The bitwise OR of \( 2^{\text{counter}} - 1 \) and \( k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) \) will have all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of \( k \), which is the maximum number of 1s possible.
   - The remaining \( n - 2 \) elements are zeros, which do not affect the bitwise OR result.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If \( k = 0 \), the program will correctly handle it by printing \( 0 \) for \( n = 1 \).
   - For \( n = 1 \), the program correctly prints \( k \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers that sum to \( k \) and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
