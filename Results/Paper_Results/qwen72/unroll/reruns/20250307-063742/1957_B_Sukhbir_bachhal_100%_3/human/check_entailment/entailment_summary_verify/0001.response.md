### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(n)` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the highest bit position set in the integer \( n \).
   - It initializes `position` to 0 and shifts \( n \) right until \( n \) becomes 0, incrementing `position` each time.
   - It returns `position - 1`, which is the highest bit position set in \( n \).
   - This function is correct and works as intended for valid inputs.

2. **Sequence Construction for \( n > 1 \):**
   - The program calls `func_1(k)` to determine the highest bit position set in \( k \).
   - It appends \( 2^{\text{counter}} - 1 \) to the array `arr`. This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of \( k \).
   - It appends \( k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) \) to the array `arr`. This ensures that the sum of the first two elements is \( k \).
   - It appends \( n - 2 \) zeros to the array `arr` to ensure the array has \( n \) elements.
   - The bitwise OR of \( 2^{\text{counter}} - 1 \) and \( k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) \) will have all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of \( k \), which is the maximum number of 1s possible.
   - The remaining \( n - 2 \) elements are zeros, which do not affect the bitwise OR result.

3. **Sequence Construction for \( n = 1 \):**
   - If \( n = 1 \), the program simply prints \( k \).
   - This satisfies the sum condition and the bitwise OR condition trivially.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If \( k = 0 \), the program will correctly handle it by printing \( 0 \) for \( n = 1 \).
   - For \( n = 1 \), the program correctly prints \( k \).

5. **Validation of the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program satisfies both the sum condition and the bitwise OR condition.
   - It also correctly handles edge cases and ensures that the sequence is constructed as required.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers that sum to \( k \) and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
