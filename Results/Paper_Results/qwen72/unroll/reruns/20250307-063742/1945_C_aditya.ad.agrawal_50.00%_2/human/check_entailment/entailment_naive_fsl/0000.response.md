Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the optimal position is before the first house (i.e., position 0). According to the problem description, if the entire village can be declared as the right side and satisfy the condition, the program should output 0. However, the current implementation does not consider this case and always starts the search from the first house, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
110
```
The correct output should be 0 because laying the road before the first house (i.e., all houses are on the right side) satisfies the condition. However, the program will output 3, which is incorrect.
