The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and a string a of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. The list of test cases should be passed as an argument to the function. The number of test cases t should be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 3·10^5.
