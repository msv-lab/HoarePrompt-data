Output State: **The loop has finished executing all test cases, and the variable `t` is 0. The function has printed the optimal position `ans` for each test case, which is the position where the number of '1's to the right and the number of '0's to the left are as balanced as possible, closest to the middle of the string.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the loop reads an integer `n` and a string `input_string` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.
- It converts the string into a list of integers `arr` and counts the number of '0's (`z`) and '1's (`o`) in the list.
- It initializes `z_r` and `o_r` to the counts of '0's and '1's, respectively, and `z_l` and `o_l` to 0.
- It calculates the initial distance `dist` from the middle of the string and sets `b_d` to `dist` if the number of '1's to the right is at least half of the remaining characters; otherwise, it sets `b_d` to a large value (30001).
- The loop then iterates through each character in `arr`, updating the counts of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides.
- It checks if the current position `pos` is a better candidate for the optimal position by comparing the balance of '0's and '1's and the distance from the middle of the string.
- If a better position is found, it updates `ans` and `b_d`.
- After processing all characters in the current test case, it prints the optimal position `ans`.
- The loop decrements `t` by 1 and repeats for the next test case.
- When `t` reaches 0, the loop terminates, and the function has printed the optimal position for each test case.
