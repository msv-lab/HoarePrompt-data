The function `func` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The number of test cases `t` should be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 3·10^5. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, if the string `a` contains an equal number of '0's and '1's, the function returns "Balanced"; otherwise, it returns "Unbalanced".

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` with characters '0' and '1'. It returns a list of results, where each result is "Balanced" if the string `a` has an equal number of '0's and '1's, or "Unbalanced" otherwise.**
