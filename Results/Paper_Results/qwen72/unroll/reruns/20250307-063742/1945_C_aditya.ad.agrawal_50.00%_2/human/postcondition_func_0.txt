The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. It then calculates and prints the optimal position `ans` for each test case, which is the position where the number of '1's to the right and the number of '0's to the left are as balanced as possible, closest to the middle of the string. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0. The function does not return any value.
