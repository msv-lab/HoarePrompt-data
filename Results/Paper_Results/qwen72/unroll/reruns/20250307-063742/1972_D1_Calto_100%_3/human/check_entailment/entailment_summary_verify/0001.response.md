### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `cnt`**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that initializing `cnt` to \(-1\) is incorrect. The count of valid pairs should start from 0. This is a clear mistake in the program.

2. **Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**:
   - The original assessment points out that the formula \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) does not directly relate to the problem's conditions. This is accurate. The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), and the provided formula does not ensure this condition.

3. **Update of `cnt`**:
   - The original assessment correctly states that the update `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is not aligned with the problem's requirements. The correct approach would involve checking each pair \((a, b)\) to see if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The original assessment suggests a correct approach: iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges, computing \(\gcd(a, b)\), and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The initialization of `cnt` and the formula used to update `cnt` are incorrect and do not align with the problem's requirements. The original assessment is accurate in its criticism of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
