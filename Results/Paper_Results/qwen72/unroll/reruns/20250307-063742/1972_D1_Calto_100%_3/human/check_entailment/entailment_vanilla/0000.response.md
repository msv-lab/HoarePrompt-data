Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.

### Analysis of `func_1(a, b)`:
- This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).
- The function works as expected and is correct.

### Analysis of `func_2(n, m)`:
- The function initializes `cnt` to \(-1\).
- It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
- For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) and \(y\) as follows:
  - \(x = n - (i * i - i)\)
  - \(y = i * i\)
- It then updates `cnt` by adding \(\left\lceil \frac{x}{y} \right\rceil\) and an additional 1 if \(x \% y == 0\).

### Correctness Check:
1. **Initialization of `cnt`**:
   - The initialization of `cnt` to \(-1\) is incorrect. The count of valid pairs should start from 0, not \(-1\).

2. **Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**:
   - The formula \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) does not directly relate to the problem's conditions.
   - The problem requires \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided formula does not ensure this condition.

3. **Update of `cnt`**:
   - The update `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is not aligned with the problem's requirements.
   - The correct approach would involve checking each pair \((a, b)\) to see if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
2. For each pair, compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

### Example:
For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the valid pairs are:
- (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)

The provided `func_2` does not correctly count these pairs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The initialization of `cnt` and the formula used to update `cnt` are incorrect and do not align with the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
