Reasoning:

The problem requires us to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1(a, b)` is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
- This function is correct and returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- `func_2(n, m)` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
- The function iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
- For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\).
- It then increments `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
- The final result is `cnt + 1`.

### Issues with `func_2`:
- The logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The expression `n - (i * i - i)` and `i * i` do not seem to be related to the problem's condition.
- The increment `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` does not count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

### Correct Approach:
- For each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), we need to count the number of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- This can be done by iterating over all possible \(a\) and checking the condition for each \(a\) and \(b\).

### Conclusion:
The provided `func_2` does not correctly implement the required logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
