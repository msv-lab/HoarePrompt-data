Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

# Annotated Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b, and b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b, where b is 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: `cnt` is the number of integers `i` in the range [1, m] such that `n - (i * i - i)` is divisible by `i * i`, minus 1.
    return cnt
    #The program returns the number of integers `i` in the range [1, m] such that `n - (i * i - i)` is divisible by `i * i`, minus 1.
