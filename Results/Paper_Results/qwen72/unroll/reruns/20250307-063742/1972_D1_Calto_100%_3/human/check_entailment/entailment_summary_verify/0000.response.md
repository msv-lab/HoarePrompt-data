### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the given functions and the original assessment:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**
   - This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The function is correct and returns the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`**
   - The function aims to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.
   - The function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It then increments `cnt` by \(\left\lceil \frac{x}{y} \right\rceil\) plus 1 if \(x \% y == 0\).

The function summary for `func_2` states that it returns the count of integers \(i\) in the range [1, m] such that \(n - (i * i - i)\) is divisible by \(i * i\), minus 1. However, this does not align with the problem's requirements. The problem requires us to count pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Counterexample Analysis:
- For \(n = 3\) and \(m = 3\):
  - The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), and \((3, 1)\).
  - The expected output is 4.

Let's see how `func_2` behaves for this input:
- For \(i = 1\):
  - \(x = 3 - (1 * 1 - 1) = 3\)
  - \(y = 1 * 1 = 1\)
  - \(\left\lceil \frac{3}{1} \right\rceil = 3\)
  - \(3 \% 1 == 0\) (True)
  - `cnt` is incremented by \(3 + 1 = 4\)

- For \(i = 2\):
  - \(x = 3 - (2 * 2 - 2) = 1\)
  - \(y = 2 * 2 = 4\)
  - \(\left\lceil \frac{1}{4} \right\rceil = 1\)
  - \(1 \% 4 == 0\) (False)
  - `cnt` is incremented by \(1 + 0 = 1\)

- For \(i = 3\):
  - \(x = 3 - (3 * 3 - 3) = -3\)
  - \(y = 3 * 3 = 9\)
  - \(\left\lceil \frac{-3}{9} \right\rceil = 0\)
  - \(-3 \% 9 == 0\) (False)
  - `cnt` is incremented by \(0 + 0 = 0\)

- Final `cnt` value: \(4 + 1 + 0 - 1 = 4\)

However, the function `func_2` is not correctly implementing the logic to count pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not correctly count these pairs.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program `func_2` does not correctly implement the required logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

Final: **False**
