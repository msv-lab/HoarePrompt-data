Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Counterexample:
Consider the test case \(n = 3\) and \(m = 3\).

- For \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 2\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since 2 is a multiple of 1, the pair (1, 1) is valid.
- For \(a = 1\) and \(b = 2\), \(a + b = 3\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2\). Since 3 is not a multiple of 2, the pair (1, 2) is invalid.
- For \(a = 1\) and \(b = 3\), \(a + b = 4\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 3 \cdot 1 = 3\). Since 4 is not a multiple of 3, the pair (1, 3) is invalid.
- For \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 3\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since 3 is a multiple of 1, the pair (2, 1) is valid.
- For \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\), \(a + b = 4\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4\). Since 4 is a multiple of 4, the pair (2, 2) is valid.
- For \(a = 2\) and \(b = 3\), \(a + b = 5\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 3 \cdot 1 = 3\). Since 5 is not a multiple of 3, the pair (2, 3) is invalid.
- For \(a = 3\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 4\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Since 4 is a multiple of 1, the pair (3, 1) is valid.
- For \(a = 3\) and \(b = 2\), \(a + b = 5\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2\). Since 5 is not a multiple of 2, the pair (3, 2) is invalid.
- For \(a = 3\) and \(b = 3\), \(a + b = 6\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 3 \cdot 3 = 9\). Since 6 is not a multiple of 9, the pair (3, 3) is invalid.

The valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), and (3, 1). Therefore, the expected output for \(n = 3\) and \(m = 3\) is 4.

However, the given program `func_2` does not correctly count these pairs. For example, when \(n = 3\) and \(m = 3\), the program returns 3, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
