### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Provided Program**:
   - The program consists of two functions:
     - `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly computes the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
     - `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

3. **Analysis of `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - The function is correct and returns the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).

4. **Analysis of `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - **Initialization of `cnt`**:
     - The initialization of `cnt` to \(-1\) is incorrect. The count of valid pairs should start from 0.
   - **Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**:
     - The formula \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) does not directly relate to the problem's conditions.
     - The problem requires \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided formula does not ensure this condition.
   - **Update of `cnt`**:
     - The update `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is not aligned with the problem's requirements.
     - The correct approach would involve checking each pair \((a, b)\) to see if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
     - Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
     - For each pair, compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).
     - Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
     - Count the number of valid pairs.

6. **Example**:
   - For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the valid pairs are:
     - (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)
   - The provided `func_2` does not correctly count these pairs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The initialization of `cnt` and the formula used to update `cnt` are incorrect and do not align with the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
