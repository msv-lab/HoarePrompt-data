You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

- Annotated Code:

        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b, and b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b, where b is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`. After the function concludes, `a` holds the GCD, and `b` is 0.

def func_2(n, m):

    #State: `cnt` is the number of integers `i` in the range [1, m] such that `n - (i * i - i)` is divisible by `i * i`, minus 1.
    return cnt
    #The program returns the number of integers `i` in the range [1, m] such that `n - (i * i - i)` is divisible by `i * i`, minus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` and returns the count of integers `i` in the range [1, m] such that `n - (i * i - i)` is divisible by `i * i`, minus 1. After the function concludes, `cnt` holds this computed value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.

### Analysis of `func_1(a, b)`:
- This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).
- The function works as expected and is correct.

### Analysis of `func_2(n, m)`:
- The function initializes `cnt` to \(-1\).
- It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
- For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) and \(y\) as follows:
  - \(x = n - (i * i - i)\)
  - \(y = i * i\)
- It then updates `cnt` by adding \(\left\lceil \frac{x}{y} \right\rceil\) and an additional 1 if \(x \% y == 0\).

### Correctness Check:
1. **Initialization of `cnt`**:
   - The initialization of `cnt` to \(-1\) is incorrect. The count of valid pairs should start from 0, not \(-1\).

2. **Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**:
   - The formula \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) does not directly relate to the problem's conditions.
   - The problem requires \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided formula does not ensure this condition.

3. **Update of `cnt`**:
   - The update `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is not aligned with the problem's requirements.
   - The correct approach would involve checking each pair \((a, b)\) to see if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
2. For each pair, compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

### Example:
For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the valid pairs are:
- (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)

The provided `func_2` does not correctly count these pairs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The initialization of `cnt` and the formula used to update `cnt` are incorrect and do not align with the problem's requirements.
