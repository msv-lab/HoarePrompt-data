Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The function returns the GCD, which is essential for the problem's condition.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - However, the logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\), and then increments `cnt` based on whether \(x\) is divisible by \(y\). This does not align with the problem's condition.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation in `func_2` does not perform this check and instead uses a different formula that does not match the problem's requirements.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_2` is incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given condition.
   - Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
