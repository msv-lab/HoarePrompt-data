The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers with the constraint that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function returns the number of integers `i` in the range [1, m] for which the expression `n - (i * i - i)` is divisible by `i * i`, minus 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` and returns the count of integers `i` in the range [1, m] such that `n - (i * i - i)` is divisible by `i * i`, minus 1.**
