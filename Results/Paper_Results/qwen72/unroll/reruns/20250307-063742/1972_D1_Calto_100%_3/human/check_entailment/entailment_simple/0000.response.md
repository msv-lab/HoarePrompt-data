### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The state of the program before the function call is that `a` and `b` are positive integers within the specified range.
   - The function returns the GCD of `a` and `b`, which is correct.

3. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - The function iterates over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
   - For each `b`, it calculates `x` as \(n - (b^2 - b)\) and `y` as \(b^2\).
   - It then increments `cnt` by the ceiling of \(x / y\) plus 1 if `x` is exactly divisible by `y`.
   - The final value of `cnt` is returned, but it is initialized to -1, which seems incorrect.

4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is not aligned with the problem statement. The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation in `func_2` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case with \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\), the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\), which satisfies the condition \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
   - For the fourth test case with \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), and \((10, 2)\).

6. **Flaws in the Program**:
   - The initialization of `cnt` to -1 is incorrect. It should be initialized to 0.
   - The logic for counting valid pairs is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. The initialization of `cnt` to -1 and the logic inside the loop are incorrect.
