The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `m`, and the range function. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1, and `i` must start at 1. The variable `cnt` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Since `n` and `m` are already defined as positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, we can assume `m` is at least 1, which is sufficient for the loop to execute. However, the initial state of `cnt` being -1 is not relevant to the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `i` starts at 1 and `m` is at least 1. 

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1, `i` is 1, `m` must be at least 1**
