Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly count the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

### Explanation:
1. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, this function is not used in `func_2`.

2. **Counting Valid Pairs**: The function `func_2` attempts to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) but does so incorrectly. The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not correctly represent the condition that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem, we need to count the number of pairs (a, b) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

One way to approach this is to iterate over all possible values of \(b\) and for each \(b\), find the valid values of \(a\). The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be simplified to:
- \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\)
- This implies \(a = (k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b)\)
- Since \(a\) must be a positive integer, \(k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b\) must be a positive integer and within the range \([1, n]\).

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **gcd Function**: This function calculates the GCD of two numbers.
- **count_valid_pairs Function**: This function iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), it iterates over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\). It checks if the condition \((a + b) \% (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\) holds and increments the count if it does.
- **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\) and prints the number of valid pairs.

This corrected program should correctly solve the problem as described.
