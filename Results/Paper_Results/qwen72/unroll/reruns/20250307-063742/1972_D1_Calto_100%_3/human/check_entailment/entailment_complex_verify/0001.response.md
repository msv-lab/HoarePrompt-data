### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `cnt`**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that initializing `cnt` to \(-1\) is incorrect. The count of valid pairs should start from 0, not \(-1\). This is a clear mistake in the program.

2. **Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**:
   - The original assessment also correctly identifies that the formula \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) does not directly relate to the problem's conditions. The problem requires \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), and the provided formula does not ensure this condition.

3. **Update of `cnt`**:
   - The update `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is indeed not aligned with the problem's requirements. The correct approach would involve checking each pair \((a, b)\) to see if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Overall Functionality**:
   - The annotated code confirms that `func_2` is counting the number of integers \(i\) in the range [1, m] such that \(n - (i * i - i)\) is divisible by \(i * i\), minus 1. This is not the same as counting the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
2. For each pair, compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

### Example:
For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the valid pairs are:
- (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)

The provided `func_2` does not correctly count these pairs.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The initialization of `cnt` and the formula used to update `cnt` are incorrect and do not align with the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
