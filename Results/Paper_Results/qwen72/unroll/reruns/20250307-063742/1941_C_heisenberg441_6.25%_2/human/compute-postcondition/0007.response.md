Output State: **`s` is a string with all occurrences of the substring 'pie' removed, and `ans` is the number of times 'pie' was found and removed from `s`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'pie' is found in the string `s`.
- Each iteration of the loop removes the first occurrence of 'pie' from `s` and increments `ans` by 1.
- Once all occurrences of 'pie' have been removed, the loop terminates.
- The final state of `s` is a string where all 'pie' substrings have been removed, and `ans` holds the count of how many times 'pie' was removed.
