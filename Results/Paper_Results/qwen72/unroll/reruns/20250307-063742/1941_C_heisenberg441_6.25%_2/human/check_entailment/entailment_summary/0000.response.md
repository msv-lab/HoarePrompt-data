Reasoning:  
The provided program has a specific function `func_1` that is responsible for making the string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. The function works by removing all occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" from the string `s` and counting how many times these substrings were removed. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Special Case Handling**: The function includes a special case where if the string `s` is exactly "mapie", it returns 1. This is incorrect because the string "mapie" can be made beautiful by removing either "map" or "pie", which would require removing only 3 characters, not 1.

2. **Substring Removal Logic**: The function uses a loop to find and remove occurrences of "map" and "pie". It removes the first two characters of the substring "map" and "pie" when found, which is incorrect. To make the string beautiful, the function should remove the entire substring "map" or "pie" when found, not just the first two characters.

3. **Efficiency**: The current implementation is inefficient because it repeatedly searches for the substrings "map" and "pie" and modifies the string, which can lead to a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case. A more efficient approach would be to use a single pass through the string to count the minimum deletions required.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
