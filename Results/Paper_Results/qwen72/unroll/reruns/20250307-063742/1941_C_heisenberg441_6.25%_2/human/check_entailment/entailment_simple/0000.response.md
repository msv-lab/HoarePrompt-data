### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Special Case**: The function has a special case where it checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If so, it returns 1. This is a specific case that is handled correctly, but it is not necessary for the general solution.
   - **Removing Substrings**:
     - The function uses a `while` loop to remove all occurrences of the substring "map" from `s` and increments `ans` by 1 for each removal.
     - Similarly, it uses another `while` loop to remove all occurrences of the substring "pie" from `s` and increments `ans` by 1 for each removal.
   - **Return Value**: The function returns the total number of characters removed (`ans`).

3. **Correctness of Substring Removal**:
   - The `while` loops correctly remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string `s`.
   - The removal is done by finding the index of the substring and slicing the string to exclude the substring, then concatenating the remaining parts.
   - The number of characters removed is correctly counted by incrementing `ans` by 1 for each removal.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the string is already beautiful (i.e., does not contain "map" or "pie") by returning 0.
   - The program also handles the case where the string is very long (up to 10^6 characters) within the constraints provided.

5. **Special Case Issue**:
   - The special case `if (s == 'mapie')` is not necessary and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program. However, it does not introduce any errors and is a valid optimization for a specific input.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning above, the program is correct in terms of functionality and meets the problem requirements. The special case `if (s == 'mapie')` is not essential but does not affect the correctness.

**Correctness: True**
