Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases to make the string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. Specifically, the program only checks for the exact substrings "map" and "pie" and removes them partially (i.e., it removes two characters at a time). However, it does not account for overlapping occurrences of these substrings or other scenarios where more optimal deletions might be required.

Here are a few issues with the program:

1. **Hardcoded Special Case**: The program has a special case for the string "mapie" which returns 1. This is not a general solution and will fail for other strings that need to be handled similarly.

2. **Inefficient Deletion**: The program removes two characters at a time from the substrings "map" and "pie". This approach is not optimal and can lead to incorrect results. For example, in the string "mmapnapie", the program will remove "map" and "pie" separately, but it should remove "m" and "e" to make the string beautiful with the minimum deletions.

3. **Overlapping Substrings**: The program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "mappppie", the program will remove "map" and "pie" separately, but it should remove "m" and "p" to make the string beautiful with the minimum deletions.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed to handle overlapping substrings and ensure the minimum number of deletions. One possible approach is to use dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal deletions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum deletions
    min_deletions = 0
    i = 0
    
    while i < len(s):
        if s[i:i+3] == "map":
            min_deletions += 1
            i += 3
        elif s[i:i+3] == "pie":
            min_deletions += 1
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    
    return min_deletions
```

This version correctly handles the substrings "map" and "pie" by incrementing the index `i` by 3 when a match is found, ensuring that overlapping substrings are considered. However, it still needs to be optimized to handle cases where removing fewer characters can achieve the same result. A more advanced approach would be required to ensure the minimum deletions in all cases.
