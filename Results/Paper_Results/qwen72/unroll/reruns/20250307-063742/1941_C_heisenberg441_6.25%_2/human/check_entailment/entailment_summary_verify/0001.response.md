### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and function summary.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
   - The function starts with a special case check: `if s == 'mapie': return 1`. This is indeed incorrect because "mapie" contains both "map" and "pie", and removing one character will not make it beautiful. It should return 2 instead.
   - The function then uses a while loop to find and remove the substring "map" from `s` until it no longer exists. Each removal increments the `ans` counter by 1.
   - Similarly, it uses another while loop to find and remove the substring "pie" from `s` until it no longer exists. Each removal also increments the `ans` counter by 1.
   - Finally, it returns the total number of deletions `ans`.

3. **Deletion Logic:**
   - The logic for removing "map" and "pie" is correct in terms of finding and removing the substrings.
   - However, the function only removes 2 characters at a time, which is not always the minimum number of deletions required. For example, if the string is "mappie", removing "map" first will leave "pie", and the function will correctly remove "pie" next, resulting in 2 deletions. But if the string is "mapppie", removing "map" first will leave "ppie", and the function will remove "pie" next, resulting in 2 deletions, which is correct.
   - The function does not handle overlapping substrings optimally, but it does handle them correctly by ensuring that all occurrences of "map" and "pie" are removed.

4. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The special case `if s == 'mapie': return 1` is incorrect. The correct number of deletions for "mapie" should be 2, as both "map" and "pie" need to be removed.

### Correctness:
- The program is incorrect because it fails to handle the special case "mapie" correctly.
- The deletion logic is generally correct but could be optimized to handle overlapping substrings more efficiently. However, the current logic does ensure that all occurrences of "map" and "pie" are removed, which is the primary requirement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program needs to be fixed to handle the special case "mapie" correctly by returning 2 instead of 1. Additionally, the deletion logic should be reviewed to ensure it handles all edge cases efficiently.

Final: **False**
