The only variable in the loop head is `s`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s.find('pie')` is not equal to `-1`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `s` is a string with all occurrences of the substring 'map' removed. This does not ensure that the loop will execute because `s` could still be a string that does not contain the substring 'pie'. Therefore, `s` needs to be adjusted to ensure it contains at least one occurrence of 'pie'.

State: **`s` is a string with all occurrences of the substring 'map' removed and must contain at least one occurrence of 'pie', `ans` is the number of times 'map' was found and removed from `s`**
