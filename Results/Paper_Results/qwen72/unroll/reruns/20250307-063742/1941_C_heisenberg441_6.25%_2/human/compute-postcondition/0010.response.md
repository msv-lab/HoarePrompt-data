Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. If `s` is equal to 'mapie', the function returns 1. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' from `s` and returns the total number of times these substrings were found and removed. The final state of the program is that `s` no longer contains the substrings 'map' or 'pie', and the function returns the count of their occurrences. **
