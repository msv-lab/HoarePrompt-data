Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of making a string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters to eliminate the substrings "pie" and "map". The function `func_1` works as follows:

1. **Special Case Handling**: The function checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If so, it returns 1, which is correct because removing one character from "mapie" (e.g., the 'i') will make it beautiful. However, this special case is not necessary for the general solution, and it might not cover all edge cases where a single character removal can make the string beautiful.

2. **Removing Substrings**:
   - The function uses a `while` loop to find and remove all occurrences of "map" from the string `s` by slicing the string and incrementing the `ans` counter each time "map" is found and removed.
   - Similarly, it uses another `while` loop to find and remove all occurrences of "pie" from the string `s` by slicing the string and incrementing the `ans` counter each time "pie" is found and removed.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the total number of characters removed (`ans`), which is the count of how many times "map" or "pie" was found and removed from the string.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **Incorrect Special Case**: The special case `if (s == 'mapie')` is not necessary and is incorrect. The string "mapie" should be made beautiful by removing one character, but this is already handled by the subsequent loops. The special case is redundant and can be removed.

- **Incorrect Substring Removal Logic**: The logic for removing "map" and "pie" is flawed. When "map" is found, the function removes only the first two characters ('m' and 'a'), which is incorrect. Similarly, when "pie" is found, the function removes only the first two characters ('p' and 'i'), which is also incorrect. To make the string beautiful, the entire substring "map" or "pie" should be removed, not just the first two characters.

To fix these issues, the function should remove the entire substring "map" or "pie" when found, and the special case should be removed. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 3:]
        ans += 3
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 3:]
        ans += 3
    return ans
```

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
