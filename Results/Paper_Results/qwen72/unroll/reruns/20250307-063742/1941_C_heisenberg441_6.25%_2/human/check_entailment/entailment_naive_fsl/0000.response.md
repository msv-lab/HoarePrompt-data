Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` only removes the first two characters of the substrings "map" and "pie" when found, which can lead to incorrect results in some scenarios. For example, consider the string "mappie". The program will first remove "map" to get "pie", and then remove "pi" from "pie" to get "e", resulting in an incorrect output of 2 instead of the correct output of 3. 

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issue:
1. The string "mappie" contains the substring "map" starting at index 0.
2. The program removes the first two characters of "map", resulting in "pie".
3. The string "pie" now contains the substring "pie" starting at index 0.
4. The program removes the first two characters of "pie", resulting in "e".
5. The final output is 2, but the correct output should be 3 because all characters of "map" and "pie" need to be removed to make the string beautiful.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this input.
