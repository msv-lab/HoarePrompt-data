Output State: **`s` is a string with all occurrences of the substring 'map' removed, and `ans` is the number of times 'map' was found and removed from `s`.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'map' is found in the string `s`. Each time the substring 'map' is found, it is removed from `s` by slicing the string before and after the 'map' substring, and the variable `ans` is incremented by 1. The loop stops when there are no more occurrences of 'map' in `s`. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `s` will no longer contain the substring 'map', and `ans` will hold the count of how many times 'map' was removed.
