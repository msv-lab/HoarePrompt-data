### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the lengths of the arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b` and sorts `b` to facilitate the selection of the most different elements.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A max heap is used to store the differences between each element in `a` and the smallest and largest elements in `b`.
   - The heap is initialized by calculating the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the first and last elements in `b`, and pushing these differences into the heap along with the original element and the index of the element in `b` that produced the larger difference.

3. **Heap Processing**:
   - The program processes the heap to maximize the total difference `D`.
   - It pops the top element from the heap, which has the largest difference.
   - If the index of the element in `b` is out of the current range `[tp1, tp2]`, it recalculates the differences using the current boundaries and updates the heap.
   - If the index is within the range, it adds the difference to `ans` and updates the boundaries `tp1` and `tp2` accordingly.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total difference `ans` for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `m == n` and all elements in `b` are the same (e.g., the second test case).
   - It also handles the case where `m > n` and the elements in `b` are distinct (e.g., the first and third test cases).

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of a heap ensures that the program efficiently selects the elements that maximize the difference.
   - The sorting of `b` is done in O(m log m) time, and the heap operations are O(n log n), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the maximum total difference `D` between the arrays `a` and `c` (constructed from `b`). It handles the input and output as specified and uses appropriate data structures to ensure efficiency.

### Correctness:
**True**
