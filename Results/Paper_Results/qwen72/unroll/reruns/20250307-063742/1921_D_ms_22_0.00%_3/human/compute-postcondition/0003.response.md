Output State: **t is 0, n and m are unchanged, a_i and b_i are unchanged, max_heap is empty, tp1 is m, tp2 is 0, and ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between each element in a_i and the closest elements in b_i.**

### Explanation:
- **t**: The loop runs `t` times, and each iteration decrements `t` by 1. After `t` iterations, `t` becomes 0.
- **n and m**: These variables are read from input for each test case and are not modified within the loop.
- **a_i and b_i**: These lists are read from input for each test case and are not modified within the loop.
- **max_heap**: This heap is used to store the maximum absolute differences between elements in `a_i` and the closest elements in `b_i`. After the loop, `max_heap` is empty because all elements are popped out.
- **tp1 and tp2**: These pointers are used to track the current positions in the sorted list `b`. After the loop, `tp1` will be equal to `m` and `tp2` will be equal to 0, indicating that all elements in `b` have been considered.
- **ans**: This variable accumulates the sum of the maximum absolute differences. After the loop, `ans` contains the total sum of these differences for the current test case. This value is printed for each test case.
