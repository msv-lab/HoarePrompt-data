Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum total difference D between Petya's array and Vasya's array. The program uses a max heap to efficiently select the largest possible differences between elements of the two arrays. It sorts the array `b` and then for each element in `a`, it calculates the differences with the smallest and largest elements in `b`. It pushes these differences along with the corresponding indices into a max heap. The heap is used to always pick the largest available difference, ensuring that the total difference D is maximized. The program handles the edge cases, such as when all elements in `b` are the same, and it ensures that each element in `b` is used at most once. Given the constraints and the logic, the program seems to work correctly for all potential cases.
