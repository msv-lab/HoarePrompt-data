### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting and Initialization:**
   - The list `b` is sorted, which is necessary to ensure that the smallest and largest elements are easily accessible.
   - A max heap is initialized to store the differences and their corresponding indices in `b`.

3. **Calculating Differences:**
   - For each element `i` in `a`, the program calculates the absolute differences with the smallest (`b[0]`) and largest (`b[m-1]`) elements in `b`.
   - It then pushes the negative of the larger difference (to simulate a max heap using Python's min heap) along with the element from `a` and the index of the element in `b` that produced the larger difference into the heap.

4. **Processing the Heap:**
   - The program processes the heap to maximize the total difference `D`.
   - If the index of the element in `b` (stored in the heap) is outside the current bounds (`tp1` and `tp2`), it recalculates the differences with the current smallest and largest elements in `b` and updates the heap accordingly.
   - If the index is within the bounds, it adds the stored difference to `ans` and updates the bounds (`tp1` and `tp2`).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total difference `D` for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all elements in `b` are the same (as in the second test case) by correctly outputting `0`.
   - It also handles the case where `m = n` by correctly choosing the elements from `b` to maximize the difference.

7. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of a heap ensures that the program efficiently selects the maximum differences.
   - Sorting `b` once per test case is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the total difference `D` for each test case. It handles all edge cases and efficiently processes the input to produce the correct output.

### Correctness:
**True**
