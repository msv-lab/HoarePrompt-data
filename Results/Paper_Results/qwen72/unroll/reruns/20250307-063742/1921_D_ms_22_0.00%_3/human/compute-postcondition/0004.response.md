Postcondition: ***t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. If t is 0, n and m are unchanged, a_i and b_i are unchanged, max_heap is empty, tp1 is m, tp2 is 0, and ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between each element in a_i and the closest elements in b_i. Otherwise, the program does nothing and all variables retain their original values.***
