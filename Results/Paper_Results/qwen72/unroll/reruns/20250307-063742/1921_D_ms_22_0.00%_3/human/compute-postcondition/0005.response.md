The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts multiple parameters. These parameters include `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i`. Here's a breakdown of what these parameters are and what the function returns:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the lengths of the lists `a_i` and `b_i`, respectively.
- `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Given these parameters, the function is expected to return a result based on the input values. However, the specific output or return value is not provided in the problem statement. Since the output is not specified, we can only describe the parameters the function accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` and `m` (integers representing the lengths of lists `a_i` and `b_i`), `a_i` (a list of `n` integers), and `b_i` (a list of `m` integers).**
