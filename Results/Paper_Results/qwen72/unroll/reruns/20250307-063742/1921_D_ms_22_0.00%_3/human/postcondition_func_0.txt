The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest elements in the sorted list `b`. After processing all test cases, the function prints the calculated sum for each test case. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are unchanged, `a` and `b` are unchanged, `max_heap` is empty, `tp1` is `m`, `tp2` is 0, and `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for the last processed test case.
