Correctness: **True**

The program provided is designed to solve the problem as described. It processes multiple test cases and for each test case, it calculates the maximum total difference \( D \) that can be obtained by selecting \( n \) integers from the \( m \) available integers and arranging them in a certain order to maximize \( D \).

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \), the lengths of the arrays \( a \) and \( b \) respectively.
   - It then reads the arrays \( a \) and \( b \).

2. **Sorting and Heap Initialization:**
   - The array \( b \) is sorted to facilitate the selection of the most extreme values (smallest and largest) that can maximize the difference.
   - A max heap (using negative values to simulate a max heap with Python's `heapq` which is a min heap by default) is initialized to store tuples of the form \((-difference, a_i, index)\), where \( difference \) is the absolute difference between \( a_i \) and the smallest or largest value in \( b \).

3. **Heap Population:**
   - For each element \( a_i \) in the array \( a \), the program calculates the difference with the smallest and largest values in \( b \).
   - It pushes the larger of these two differences into the heap, along with the corresponding \( a_i \) and the index of the chosen value in \( b \).

4. **Heap Processing:**
   - The program processes the heap to ensure that the selected values from \( b \) are distinct.
   - If the index of the value in \( b \) that was initially chosen is no longer valid (i.e., it has been used), the program recalculates the difference with the next available smallest or largest value in \( b \).
   - The maximum difference is added to the total sum \( ans \).

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the maximum total difference \( D \).

### Verification:

- **First Test Case:**
  - \( a = [6, 1, 2, 4] \)
  - \( b = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7] \)
  - The program can choose \( c = [1, 5, 7, 2] \) to maximize \( D \).
  - \( D = |6-1| + |1-5| + |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 16 \).

- **Second Test Case:**
  - \( a = [1, 1, 1] \)
  - \( b = [1, 1, 1, 1] \)
  - The program can only choose \( c = [1, 1, 1] \).
  - \( D = |1-1| + |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \).

- **Third Test Case:**
  - \( a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \)
  - \( b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \)
  - The program can choose \( c = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] \) to maximize \( D \).
  - \( D = |1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| + |4-2| + |5-1| = 4 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 12 \).

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, and the logic ensures that the maximum possible difference is calculated. Therefore, the program is correct.
