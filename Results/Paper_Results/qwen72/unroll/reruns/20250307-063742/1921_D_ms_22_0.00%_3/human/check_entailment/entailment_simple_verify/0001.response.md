### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting `b`:**
   - Sorting `b` is a crucial step because it allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements, which are the most likely to maximize the absolute differences. This step is correctly implemented.

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A max heap is used to store tuples of the form `(-difference, a_i, index)`. This is a good approach because it allows us to prioritize the elements of `a` that have the largest potential differences with the elements of `b`.
   - For each element `i` in `a`, it calculates the difference with the smallest element `b[0]` and the largest element `b[m-1]`.
   - It pushes the tuple with the larger difference into the heap. This ensures that the heap contains the most significant differences first.

4. **Heap Processing:**
   - The program processes the heap to maximize the total difference `ans`.
   - It pops elements from the heap and checks if the index (either `0` or `m-1`) is still within the valid range `[tp1, tp2]`.
   - If the index is out of range, it recalculates the differences with the current smallest and largest valid elements in `b` and updates the heap. This ensures that we are always using the most extreme values available in `b` to maximize the differences.
   - If the index is within range, it adds the difference to `ans` and updates the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` accordingly. This ensures that we are not reusing elements of `b` that have already been used.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum total difference `ans` for each test case.

### Detailed Reasoning:

- **Sorting `b`:** Sorting `b` is essential for the algorithm to work efficiently. By sorting, we can easily access the smallest and largest elements, which are the most likely to maximize the absolute differences. This step is correctly implemented.

- **Heap Usage:** The use of a max heap (simulated with negative values) is a good strategy because it allows us to always consider the largest differences first. This ensures that we are maximizing the total difference `D`.

- **Index Range Check:** The program checks if the index of the element in `b` (either `0` or `m-1`) is still within the valid range `[tp1, tp2]`. If the index is out of range, it recalculates the differences with the current smallest and largest valid elements in `b` and updates the heap. This ensures that we are always using the most extreme values available in `b` to maximize the differences.

- **Pointer Updates:** The pointers `tp1` and `tp2` are updated to ensure that we are not reusing elements of `b` that have already been used. This is necessary to maintain the constraint that we can only use `n` elements from `b`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference \( D \) by always choosing the most extreme values from `b` and ensuring that each element of `a` is paired with the element of `b` that maximizes the absolute difference. The use of a heap and the dynamic adjustment of the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` ensure that the solution is both efficient and correct.

### Final Evaluation:
