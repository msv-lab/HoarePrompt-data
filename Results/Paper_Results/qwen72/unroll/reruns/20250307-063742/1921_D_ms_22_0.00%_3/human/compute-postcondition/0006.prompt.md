You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

        #State: t is 0, n and m are unchanged, a_i and b_i are unchanged, max_heap is empty, tp1 is m, tp2 is 0, and ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between each element in a_i and the closest elements in b_i.
    #State: *t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. If t is 0, n and m are unchanged, a_i and b_i are unchanged, max_heap is empty, tp1 is m, tp2 is 0, and ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between each element in a_i and the closest elements in b_i. Otherwise, the program does nothing and all variables retain their original values.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` and `m` (integers representing the lengths of lists `a_i` and `b_i`), `a_i` (a list of `n` integers), and `b_i` (a list of `m` integers).

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
