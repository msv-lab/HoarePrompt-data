### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting and Heap Initialization:**
   - The list `b` is sorted, which is necessary to efficiently find the maximum differences.
   - A max heap (using negative values to simulate a max heap with Python's `heapq`) is initialized to store the potential maximum differences and their corresponding indices in `b`.

3. **Calculating Initial Differences:**
   - For each element in `a`, the function calculates the absolute differences with the smallest and largest elements in `b`.
   - It pushes the larger of these differences into the max heap along with the element from `a` and the index of the element in `b` that produced the larger difference.

4. **Heap Processing:**
   - The function processes the max heap to ensure that the selected elements from `b` are distinct and not reused.
   - It checks if the index of the element in `b` (stored in the heap) is within the current range `[tp1, tp2]`.
   - If the index is out of the range, it recalculates the differences with the current smallest and largest available elements in `b` and updates the range.
   - If the index is within the range, it adds the stored difference to the answer and updates the range.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the calculated sum of the maximum absolute differences for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- **Sorting `b`** ensures that the smallest and largest elements are easily accessible.
- **Using a max heap** allows the function to always consider the largest possible difference first, which is crucial for maximizing the total difference.
- **Range Update** ensures that each element in `b` is used exactly once, which is necessary to avoid reusing elements and to maximize the differences.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element in `b` (m = 1):** The function will correctly handle this case by always using the single element in `b` for all elements in `a`.
- **All Elements in `b` are the Same:** The function will correctly handle this case by always using the same element in `b` for all elements in `a`, resulting in a difference of 0 if all elements in `a` are also the same.
- **Multiple Test Cases:** The function correctly processes multiple test cases by resetting the necessary variables for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the maximum total difference `D` for each test case. The use of sorting and a max heap ensures that the solution is efficient and handles all edge cases appropriately.
