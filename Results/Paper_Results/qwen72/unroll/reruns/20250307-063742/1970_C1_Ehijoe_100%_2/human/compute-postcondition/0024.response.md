Postcondition: **The `tree` list now contains the path from `s` to `e` in the tree followed by `e`, `prev` is equal to `e`, `curr` is equal to `e`, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in the `tree` list, `moves` is a list containing `[idx, n - idx - 1]`. If at least one element in `moves` is an odd number, the program takes a specific action (details not provided). If all elements in `moves` are even, the program takes a different specific action (details not provided).**
