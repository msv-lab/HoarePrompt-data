Output State: **The `tree` list now contains the path from `s` to `e` in the tree followed by `e`, `prev` is equal to `e`, `curr` is equal to `e`, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in the `tree` list, `moves` is a list containing `[idx, n - idx - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet creates a list `moves` that contains two elements: the first element is `idx` (the index of `start` in the `tree` list), and the second element is `n - idx - 1` (where `n` is the length of the `tree` list). The values of `tree`, `prev`, `curr`, `start`, and `idx` remain unchanged.
