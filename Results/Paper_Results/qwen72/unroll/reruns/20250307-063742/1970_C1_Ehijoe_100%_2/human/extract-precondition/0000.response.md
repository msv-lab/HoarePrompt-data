Precondition: **The function `func_1` is not properly defined to match the problem description. The function should take parameters for the number of nodes `n`, the edges of the tree, and the starting node `u_1`. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(n, edges, u_1):` where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples (u, v) representing the edges of the tree with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.**
