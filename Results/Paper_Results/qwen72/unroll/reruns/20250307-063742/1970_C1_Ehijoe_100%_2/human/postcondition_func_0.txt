The function `func_1` reads the number of nodes `n` and an unused variable `t` from input, then constructs an adjacency list representation of a tree using the edges provided through standard input. It identifies the two end nodes of the longest path in the tree and constructs a list `tree` that represents this path. The function then reads a starting node `start` from input, finds its position in the `tree` list, and calculates the number of moves to reach either end of the path. If at least one of these move counts is odd, the function prints 'Ron'. Otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value.
