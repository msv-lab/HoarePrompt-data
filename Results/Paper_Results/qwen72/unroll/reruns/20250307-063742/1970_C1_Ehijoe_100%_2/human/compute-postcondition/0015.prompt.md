Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nodes` retains its initial value as a defaultdict with a list as the default factory, containing the adjacency list representation of the tree. `edges` is still an empty list. `empty` is `True`. `n` and `t` retain their initial values. `ends` contains all the keys from `nodes` that have exactly one element in their adjacency list. `s` is the first key in `ends` and `e` is the second key in `ends`. `tree` is a list containing the value of `s`. `prev` is equal to `s`. `curr` is set to the first element in the adjacency list of `s` from `nodes`.
Code of the loop:
while curr != e:
    tree.append(curr)
    if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][1]
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][0]



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
