Output State: `nodes` is a defaultdict with a list as the default factory, containing the adjacency list representation of the tree. `edges` is still an empty list. `empty` is `True`. `n` and `t` retain their initial values. `ends` is a list containing all the keys from `nodes` that have exactly one adjacent node.
