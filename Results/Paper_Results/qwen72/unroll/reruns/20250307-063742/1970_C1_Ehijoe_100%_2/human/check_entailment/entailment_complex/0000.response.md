Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, but it should take parameters for the number of nodes `n`, the edges of the tree, and the starting node `u_1` as per the problem description.
   - The function reads the input directly using `input()` calls, which is not ideal for testing and reusability. However, this is a common practice in competitive programming and does not necessarily make the function incorrect.

2. **Tree Construction**:
   - The function correctly constructs the adjacency list representation of the tree using `defaultdict(list)`.
   - It identifies the two leaves of the tree by checking which nodes have exactly one neighbor and stores them in the `ends` list.

3. **Path Construction**:
   - The function constructs the path from one leaf to the other by traversing the tree. This is done using a while loop that continues until the current node is the other leaf.
   - The `tree` list is correctly built to represent the path from one leaf to the other.

4. **Game Logic**:
   - The function reads the starting node `start` and finds its index in the `tree` list.
   - It calculates the number of moves required to reach either end of the path from the starting node.
   - The game logic is based on the observation that if either of the move counts is odd, Ron wins (since he starts and makes the first move). If both move counts are even, Hermione wins.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the winner based on the calculated move counts.

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the function appears to correctly implement the game logic and determine the winner based on the starting node and the structure of the tree.

Correctness: **True**
