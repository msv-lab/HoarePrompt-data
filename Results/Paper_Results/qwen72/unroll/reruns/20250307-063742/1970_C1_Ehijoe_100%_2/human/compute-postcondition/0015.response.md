Output State: **The `tree` list contains the path from `s` to `e` in the tree, `prev` is equal to `e`, and `curr` is equal to `e`.**

### Explanation:
- **`tree`**: Initially, `tree` contains only the starting node `s`. As the loop iterates, it appends each node along the path from `s` to `e` to the `tree` list. By the time the loop finishes, `tree` will contain all the nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they were visited.
- **`prev`**: This variable keeps track of the previous node in the path. After the loop finishes, `prev` will be the last node visited before reaching `e`, which is `e` itself.
- **`curr`**: This variable keeps track of the current node being processed. The loop continues until `curr` is equal to `e`, so by the end of the loop, `curr` will be `e`.

The other variables (`nodes`, `edges`, `empty`, `n`, `t`, `ends`, `s`, and `e`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
