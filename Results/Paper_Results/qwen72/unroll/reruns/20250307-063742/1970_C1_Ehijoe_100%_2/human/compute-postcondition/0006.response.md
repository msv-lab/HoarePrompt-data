Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict with a list as the default factory, containing the adjacency list representation of the tree. `edges` is still an empty list. `empty` is `True`. `n` and `t` retain their initial values. `ends` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ends`. The other variables `nodes`, `edges`, `empty`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged.
