Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `u_1`. `n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in a tree, with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5. `edges` is a list of tuples (u, v) representing the edges of the tree, with each u and v being integers in the range 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. `u_1` is an integer representing the starting node, with the constraint 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the problem description.**
