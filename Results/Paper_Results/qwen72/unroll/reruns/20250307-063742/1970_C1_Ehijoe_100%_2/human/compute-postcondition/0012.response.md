Output State: **`nodes` retains its initial value as a defaultdict with a list as the default factory, containing the adjacency list representation of the tree. `edges` is still an empty list. `empty` is `True`. `n` and `t` retain their initial values. `ends` contains all the keys from `nodes` that have exactly one element in their adjacency list. `s` is the first key in `ends` and `e` is the second key in `ends`. `tree` is a list containing the value of `s`. `prev` is equal to `s`.**
