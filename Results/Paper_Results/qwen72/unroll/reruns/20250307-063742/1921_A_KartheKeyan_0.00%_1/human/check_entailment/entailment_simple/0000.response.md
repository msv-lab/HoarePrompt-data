### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case by reading four pairs of coordinates. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Sorting Coordinates**: The program sorts the list of coordinates. Sorting the coordinates helps in identifying the side lengths of the square. However, the sorting method used here is not optimal for identifying the side lengths of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Sorting by both x and y coordinates together can mix up the points, making it difficult to correctly identify the side lengths.

3. **Calculating Side Lengths**: The program calculates two distances `p1` and `p2` using the Euclidean distance formula. However, for a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the side lengths can be directly determined by the differences in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the points. The program should calculate the side length as the difference between the x-coordinates of the leftmost and rightmost points or the y-coordinates of the topmost and bottommost points.

4. **Area Calculation**: The program calculates the area by taking the square root of `p1` and `p2`, multiplying them, and then taking the absolute value. This is unnecessary and incorrect for a square. The area of a square is simply the side length squared.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is correct.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Read the coordinates.
- Identify the side length by finding the difference between the x-coordinates of the leftmost and rightmost points or the y-coordinates of the topmost and bottommost points.
- Calculate the area as the side length squared.
- Print the area for each test case.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        
        for i in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Sort the coordinates by x, then by y
        coord = sorted(coord)
        
        # The side length can be determined by the difference in x-coordinates of the first two points
        side_length = coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]
        
        # Alternatively, the side length can be determined by the difference in y-coordinates of the last two points
        if side_length == 0:
            side_length = coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]
        
        # Calculate the area of the square
        area = side_length ** 2
        
        print(area)
        
        n -= 1
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it uses an inappropriate method to calculate the side length of the square and then incorrectly calculates the area. The corrected program uses the correct method to determine the side length and calculates the area correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**
