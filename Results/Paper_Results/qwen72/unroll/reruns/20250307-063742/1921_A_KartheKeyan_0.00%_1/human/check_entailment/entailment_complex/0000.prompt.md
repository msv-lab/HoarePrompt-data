Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) â€” the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a list of tuples as input, where each tuple represents the coordinates of a corner of the square. The list contains exactly four tuples, and each tuple consists of two integers (x_i, y_i) such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The coordinates represent a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.

        l = int(input())

        res = 0
        
        for i in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())

        coord = sorted(coord)
        
        p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2

        print(res)
        
        n -= 1
        
    #State: `n` is 0, `l` is the last input integer, `s` is the last calculated value of `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`, and the list of tuples representing the coordinates of the square remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function repeatedly reads an integer `n` from the user and for each value of `n`, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It then calculates and prints the area of the square. After processing `n` squares, the function terminates with `n` set to 0. The function does not return any value.
