The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be non-zero, i.e., `n` must be greater than 0 or less than 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `l` is the last input integer, `s` is the last calculated value of `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`, and the list of tuples representing the coordinates of the square remains unchanged.**
