Output State: **`n` is 0, `l` is the last input integer, `s` is the last calculated value of `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`, and the list of tuples representing the coordinates of the square remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The loop decrements `n` by 1 in each iteration. After all iterations, `n` will be 0.
- **`l`**: The variable `l` is not modified within the loop, so it remains the last input integer.
- **`s`**: The variable `s` is not modified within the loop, so it remains the last calculated value of `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`.
- **`coord`**: The list `coord` is reinitialized to an empty list at the start of each iteration of the loop, and it is populated with the coordinates of the square for that iteration. However, since `coord` is reinitialized in each iteration, the final state of `coord` is not preserved across iterations and is not relevant to the output state.
- **`res`**: The variable `res` is reinitialized to 0 at the start of each iteration and is used to store the result of the calculation for that iteration. The final value of `res` is not preserved across iterations and is not relevant to the output state.

Thus, the only variables that are affected by the loop are `n` and `res` (which is printed and then reset each iteration), while `l` and `s` remain unchanged. The list of tuples representing the coordinates of the square is also not affected by the loop.
