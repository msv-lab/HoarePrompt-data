Functionality: ** The function repeatedly reads an integer `n` from the user and for each value of `n`, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It then calculates and prints the area of the square. After processing `n` squares, the function terminates with `n` set to 0. The function does not return any value. **
