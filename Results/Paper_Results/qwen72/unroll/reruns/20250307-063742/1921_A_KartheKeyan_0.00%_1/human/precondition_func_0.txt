The function should take a list of tuples as input, where each tuple represents the coordinates of a corner of the square. The list contains exactly four tuples, and each tuple consists of two integers (x_i, y_i) such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The coordinates represent a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.
