Initial State: The function should take a list of tuples as input, where each tuple represents the coordinates of a corner of the square. The list contains exactly four tuples, and each tuple consists of two integers (x_i, y_i) such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The coordinates represent a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.

Code Snippet:
```python
n = int(input())
     
while n :
    
    l = int(input())
    s = 0
    s += (l//4)+(l-(4*(l//4)))//2
    print(s)
    n-=1
```

Now, let's think step by step:

1. `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input.
2. The `while` loop runs as long as `n` is not zero.
3. Inside the loop:
   - `l` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input.
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `s` is updated to `s += (l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`.
   - The value of `s` is printed.
   - `n` is decremented by 1.
4. The loop continues until `n` becomes zero.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `l` is the last input integer, `s` is the last calculated value of `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`, and the list of tuples representing the coordinates of the square remains unchanged.**
