The function `func` accepts a parameter, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple represents the coordinates of a corner of the square, and the list contains exactly four tuples. Each tuple consists of two integers (x_i, y_i) such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The coordinates represent a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area. The function returns the area of the square.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of four tuples, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of a corner of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It returns the area of the square.**
