Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the given program. The program's approach to sorting the coordinates and calculating the distances between points is flawed. Specifically:

1. **Sorting Coordinates:**
   - Sorting the coordinates as a whole list of tuples might not place the points in the correct order for a square with sides parallel to the axes. For example, if the coordinates are (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2), sorting them will result in [(1, 2), (1, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5)], which does not help in identifying the side length directly.

2. **Calculating the Side Length:**
   - The program calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points, but these pairs are not necessarily adjacent sides of the square. For a square with sides parallel to the axes, the side length can be determined by the difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent points.

3. **Area Calculation:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the area by taking the square root of the squared distances and then multiplying them. The area of a square is simply the side length squared, and there is no need to use `abs` or `math.sqrt` in this context.

The corrected program provided in the original assessment is accurate and correctly solves the problem by:
- Extracting and sorting the x and y coordinates separately.
- Calculating the side length as the difference between the first and second x-coordinates (or y-coordinates).
- Calculating the area as the side length squared.

Given the issues identified and the correct approach provided, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the given program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
