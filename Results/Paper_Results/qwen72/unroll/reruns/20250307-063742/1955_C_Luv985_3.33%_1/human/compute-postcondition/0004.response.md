The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k`. Each `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and each `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^{15}.
- `b` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains the durability values `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` of the ships. Each durability value `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines the minimum number of operations required to reduce the durability of all ships to zero or below, given that in each operation, the durability of exactly `k` ships can be reduced by 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, a list of tuples `a` containing `n` and `k`, and a list of lists `b` containing the durability values of the ships. It returns a list of results, where each result is the minimum number of operations required to reduce the durability of all ships to zero or below for each test case.**
