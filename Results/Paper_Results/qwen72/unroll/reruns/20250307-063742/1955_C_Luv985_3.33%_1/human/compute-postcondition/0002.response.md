The loop condition is `while T:`. For the loop to execute at least once, `T` must evaluate to `True`. Since `T` is an integer, the only way it can evaluate to `True` is if it is non-zero. Given that `T` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `T` is not zero for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`T` must be a non-zero integer**
