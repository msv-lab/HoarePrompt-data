You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t, a list of tuples where each tuple contains n and k, and a list of lists where each sublist contains the durability values a_1, a_2, ..., a_n of the ships. t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and each k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^{15}. Each durability value a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    #State: The loop will print the number of ships that have been completely destroyed for each test case, and `T` will be 0 after all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, a list of tuples `a` containing `n` and `k`, and a list of lists `b` containing the durability values of the ships. It returns a list of results, where each result is the minimum number of operations required to reduce the durability of all ships to zero or below for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
