Functionality: ** The function reads input from the user and processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of ships, an integer `k` representing the total number of operations available, and a list of integers `a` representing the durability of each ship. The function calculates and prints the number of ships that can be completely destroyed (i.e., their durability reduced to zero or below) using the given operations for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `T` being 0. **
