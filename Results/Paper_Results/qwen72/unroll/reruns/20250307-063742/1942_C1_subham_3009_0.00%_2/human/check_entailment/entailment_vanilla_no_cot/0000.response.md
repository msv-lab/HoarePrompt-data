Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program simply prints `x - 2` for each test case, which is incorrect because it does not consider the actual vertices chosen by Bessie or the constraints of the problem. The number of triangular pieces that can be formed depends on the specific vertices chosen and their arrangement around the polygon, not just the number of chosen vertices.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to:
1. Analyze the chosen vertices to determine how many non-intersecting diagonals can be drawn.
2. Calculate the maximum number of triangles that can be formed based on the arrangement of these vertices.

The current implementation does not perform these steps and thus is incorrect.
