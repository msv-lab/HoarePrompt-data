### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has chosen `x` vertices, and we are not allowed to choose any additional vertices (`y = 0`).
   - The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by drawing diagonals between the chosen vertices.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed by drawing diagonals from `x` vertices in a convex polygon is indeed `x - 2`.
   - This is a well-known property of triangulation in convex polygons. For any convex polygon with `x` vertices, the number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It then reads the `x` vertices chosen by Bessie.
   - Finally, it prints `x - 2` for each test case.

4. **Validation**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic that the number of non-intersecting triangles is `x - 2`.
   - The input handling is correct, and it processes each test case as expected.
   - The constraints are respected, and the program does not perform any operations that would violate them.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the minimum value of `x` (which is 2) correctly. For `x = 2`, the number of triangles is `0`, which is correct.
   - The program also handles the maximum value of `x` (up to `2 * 10^5`) correctly, as it simply prints `x - 2` without any additional complexity.

6. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func` processes multiple test cases.
   - Each test case involves a regular polygon with `n` sides and `x` distinct vertices chosen by Bessie.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0), followed by a list of `x` vertices.
   - The function then prints `x - 2` for each test case.
   - After processing all test cases, the function sets `t` to 0 if it is the main module. If the function is not the main module, `t` remains unchanged and no specific action is performed.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the constraints provided. It correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices.

Final: **True**
