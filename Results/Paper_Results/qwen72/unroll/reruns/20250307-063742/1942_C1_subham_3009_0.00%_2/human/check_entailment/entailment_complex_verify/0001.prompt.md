You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of a regular polygon with n sides (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), x vertices chosen by Bessie (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), and y = 0. The vertices chosen by Bessie are distinct integers from 1 to n. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    if (__name__ == '__main__') :
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            
            arr = input().split()
            
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            
            print(x - 2)
            
        #State: t = 0.
    #State: *If the program is the main module, `t` is set to 0. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged and the function does not execute any specific action.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves a regular polygon with `n` sides and `x` distinct vertices chosen by Bessie. The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0), followed by a list of `x` vertices. The function then prints `x - 2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function sets `t` to 0 if it is the main module. If the function is not the main module, `t` remains unchanged and no specific action is performed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has chosen `x` vertices, and we are not allowed to choose any additional vertices (`y = 0`).
   - The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by drawing diagonals between the chosen vertices.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - In a regular polygon, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed by drawing diagonals from `x` vertices is `x - 2`.
   - This is a well-known property of polygons and triangulation. For any convex polygon with `x` vertices, the number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It then reads the `x` vertices chosen by Bessie.
   - Finally, it prints `x - 2` for each test case.

4. **Validation**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic that the number of non-intersecting triangles is `x - 2`.
   - The input handling is correct, and it processes each test case as expected.
   - The constraints are respected, and the program does not perform any operations that would violate them.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the minimum value of `x` (which is 2) correctly. For `x = 2`, the number of triangles is `0`, which is correct.
   - The program also handles the maximum value of `x` (up to `2 * 10^5`) correctly, as it simply prints `x - 2` without any additional complexity.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the constraints provided. It correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices.

Correctness: **True**
