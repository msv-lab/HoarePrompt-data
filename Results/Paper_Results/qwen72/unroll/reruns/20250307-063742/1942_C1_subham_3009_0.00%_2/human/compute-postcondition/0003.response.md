Output State: **t = 0.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` will be 0. The loop decrements `t` by 1 at the beginning of each iteration, and it continues to run as long as `t` is greater than 0. Once `t` reaches 0, the loop condition `t > 0` becomes false, and the loop terminates. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are read from input for each test case, and the list `arr` is created and populated with the vertices chosen by Bessie, but these variables are not retained or modified outside the scope of the loop. The loop prints `x - 2` for each test case, but this does not affect the state of the variables in the loop head or body.
