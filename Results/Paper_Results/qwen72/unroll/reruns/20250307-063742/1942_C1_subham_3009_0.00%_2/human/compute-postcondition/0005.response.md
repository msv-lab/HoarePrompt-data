The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves a regular polygon with `n` sides, where `4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, and `x` vertices chosen by Bessie, where `2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)`. The vertices chosen by Bessie are distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`. The function also involves a parameter `y` which is always 0. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed `2 · 10^5`.

The function returns the result of some computation based on the input parameters for each test case. However, the specific output for each case is not provided in the constraints and relationships.
