You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            arr = input().split()
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            print(x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves a regular polygon with `n` sides and `x` distinct vertices chosen by Bessie. The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0), followed by a list of `x` vertices. The function then prints `x - 2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function sets `t` to 0 if it is the main module. If the function is not the main module, `t` remains unchanged and no specific action is performed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the program always prints `x - 2` as the answer, which is incorrect for the following reasons:

1. **Handling of y = 0**: The problem description specifies that `y = 0`, meaning you cannot choose any additional vertices. The program does not consider this constraint and simply outputs `x - 2` without checking if the chosen vertices can form non-intersecting triangles.

2. **Correct Calculation of Triangles**: The number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed depends on the specific vertices chosen and their arrangement on the polygon. The program does not account for the arrangement of the vertices and simply subtracts 2 from the number of chosen vertices, which is not a valid approach.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the chosen vertices might not form any triangles or where the vertices are not in a configuration that allows for the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles.

**Example Case**:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  8 4 0
  1 6 2 5
  8 8 0
  1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
  4 2 0
  1 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  6
  0
  ```
- Actual Output from the Program:
  ```
  2
  6
  0
  ```

However, the actual output for the third test case should be `2` (as shown in the problem description), not `0`. The program fails to correctly calculate the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces for this case.
