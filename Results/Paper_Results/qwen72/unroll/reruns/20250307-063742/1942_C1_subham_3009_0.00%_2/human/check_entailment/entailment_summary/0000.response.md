### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the vertices chosen by Bessie. Given that Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices and `y` is always 0, we cannot choose any additional vertices. The key insight here is that for a set of `x` vertices in a regular polygon, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`.

This is a well-known property of triangulation in polygons:
- For any set of `x` vertices, the number of non-intersecting diagonals that can be drawn is `x - 3`.
- Each diagonal added forms one additional triangle.
- Therefore, the total number of triangles formed is `x - 2`.

The program reads the input correctly and processes each test case by:
1. Reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, reading `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0).
3. Reading the list of `x` vertices chosen by Bessie.
4. Printing `x - 2` for each test case.

The program does not perform any unnecessary operations and directly outputs the correct result based on the given problem constraints and properties of polygon triangulation.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly solves the problem as described and matches the expected output for the given test cases.
