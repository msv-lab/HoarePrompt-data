Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the vertices chosen by Bessie and any additional vertices chosen by you. However, in this version of the problem, `y` is always 0, which means you cannot choose any additional vertices. Therefore, the task reduces to finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using only the `x` vertices chosen by Bessie.

For a set of `x` vertices in a regular polygon, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`. This is a well-known result in combinatorial geometry. Given `x` vertices, you can form a triangulation of the polygon that includes `x - 2` triangles.

The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints `x - 2` for each test case. The logic is straightforward and aligns with the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
