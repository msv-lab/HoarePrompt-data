The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of a regular polygon with n sides (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), x vertices chosen by Bessie (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), and y = 0. The vertices chosen by Bessie are distinct integers from 1 to n. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The program is currently executing as the main module, and `t` must be greater than 0.**
