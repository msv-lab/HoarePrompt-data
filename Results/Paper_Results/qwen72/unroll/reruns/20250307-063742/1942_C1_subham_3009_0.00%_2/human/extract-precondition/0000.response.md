Precondition: **The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of a regular polygon with n sides (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), x vertices chosen by Bessie (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), and y = 0. The vertices chosen by Bessie are distinct integers from 1 to n. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
