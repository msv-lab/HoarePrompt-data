You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of a regular polygon with n sides (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), x vertices chosen by Bessie (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), and y = 0. The vertices chosen by Bessie are distinct integers from 1 to n. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    if (__name__ == '__main__') :
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            
            arr = input().split()
            
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            
            print(x - 2)
            
        #State: t = 0.
    #State: *If the program is the main module, `t` is set to 0. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged and the function does not execute any specific action.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function handles multiple test cases, each involving a regular polygon with `n` sides (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `x` distinct vertices chosen by Bessie (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)). The function also includes a parameter `y` which is always 0. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns a result based on the input parameters for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
