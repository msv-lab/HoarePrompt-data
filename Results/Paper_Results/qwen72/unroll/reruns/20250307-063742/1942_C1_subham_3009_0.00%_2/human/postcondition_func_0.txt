The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves a regular polygon with `n` sides and `x` distinct vertices chosen by Bessie. The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0), followed by a list of `x` vertices. The function then prints `x - 2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function sets `t` to 0 if it is the main module. If the function is not the main module, `t` remains unchanged and no specific action is performed.
