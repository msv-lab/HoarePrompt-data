The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is `x - 1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be non-zero after the subtraction. Therefore, the initial value of `x` must be at least 1 (since `x` is now `x - 1`, the initial `x` must have been at least 1 to ensure `x` is not zero).

State: **`x` is an input integer and `x` is now `x - 1` and `x` must be non-zero**
