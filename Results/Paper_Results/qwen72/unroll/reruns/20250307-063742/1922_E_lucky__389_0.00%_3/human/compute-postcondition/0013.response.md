The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a single integer `X` where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18. The function should return or print an array if such an array exists, where the length of the array is at most 200, and all elements of the array are integers in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. If no such array exists, the function should return or print -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with a single integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). It returns an array of integers (with a maximum length of 200 and each element in the range [-10^9, 10^9]) if such an array exists. If no such array exists, it returns -1.**
