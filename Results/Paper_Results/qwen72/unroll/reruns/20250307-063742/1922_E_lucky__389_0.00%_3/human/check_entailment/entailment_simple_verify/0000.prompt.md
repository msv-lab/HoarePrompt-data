You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to handle multiple test cases, each with a single integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), and the function should return or print the required array or -1 if no such array exists. The length of the array, if it exists, should be at most 200, and all elements of the array should be integers in the range [-10^9, 10^9].

        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing integers representing the lengths of the sub-sequences, `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`, `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx-1` followed by all the integers in `subseq_lens` except the first one.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: - The `print(len(ansv))` statement will print the length of the list `ansv`.
    #   - Based on the initial state, the length of `ansv` is `mx + (len(subseq_lens) - 1)`.
    #
    #Output:
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: The loop prints all the integers from 0 to `mx-1` followed by all the integers in `subseq_lens` except the first one, separated by spaces. The values of `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where `X` is a power of 2 minus 1. For example, when `X = 3`, the program should output an array with exactly 3 increasing subsequences, but it does not. The program subtracts 1 from `X` at the beginning, which means it is trying to find an array with `X - 1` increasing subsequences, but this approach does not always work correctly, especially for certain values of `X`.

For `X = 3`:
- The program sets `x = 2` initially.
- It then enters the loop and finds that `2 ** 1 <= 3`, so it appends `1` to `subseq_lens` and sets `x = 0`.
- The final array `ansv` is `[0, 1]`, which has 3 increasing subsequences: `[], [0], [1]`.
- However, the correct output should be an array with exactly 3 increasing subsequences, such as `[0, 1, 2]`, which has the subsequences `[], [0], [1], [2], [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], [0, 1, 2]`.

The program does not correctly handle this case, leading to an incorrect output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
