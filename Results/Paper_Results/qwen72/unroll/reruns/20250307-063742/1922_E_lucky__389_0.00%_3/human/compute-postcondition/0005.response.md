Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing integers representing the lengths of the sub-sequences, and `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is not 0.
- Inside the loop, `i` is incremented until `2 ** (i + 1)` exceeds `x + 1`.
- If `i` is 0, the loop breaks.
- Otherwise, `i` is appended to `subseq_lens`, and `x` is reduced by `2 ** i - 1`.
- `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `i`.
- The loop will continue to reduce `x` until `x` becomes 0, at which point the loop will terminate.
- The final state of `subseq_lens` will be a list of integers representing the lengths of the sub-sequences, and `mx` will be the largest integer in this list.
