Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem for all given test cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to find the lengths of subsequences that sum up to `x - 1` using powers of 2. However, the logic for calculating these lengths and constructing the array is flawed.
   - Specifically, the loop `while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` does not correctly identify the appropriate lengths of subsequences.

2. **Array Construction**:
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by appending the lengths of the subsequences, but this does not ensure that the resulting array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The program does not handle the case where `X` is a power of 2 correctly. For example, if `X` is 2, the program should output an array of length 1 with a single element, but it incorrectly outputs an array of length 1 with the element 0, which does not have exactly 2 increasing subsequences.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not handle the case where no valid array can be found. It should print `-1` in such cases, but it does not have a mechanism to detect and handle this scenario.

### Example Test Cases:
- For `X = 2`, the correct output should be:
  ```
  1
  0
  ```
  But the program outputs:
  ```
  1
  0
  ```
  This is incorrect because the array `[0]` has only 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`), not 2.

- For `X = 5`, the correct output could be:
  ```
  3
  0 1 0
  ```
  But the program outputs:
  ```
  3
  0 1 2
  ```
  This is incorrect because the array `[0, 1, 2]` has 7 increasing subsequences (including the empty subsequence), not 5.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases and has logical and output format issues. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
