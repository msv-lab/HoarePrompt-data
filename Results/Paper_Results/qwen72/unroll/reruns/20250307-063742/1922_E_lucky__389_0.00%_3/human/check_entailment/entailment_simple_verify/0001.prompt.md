You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to handle multiple test cases, each with a single integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), and the function should return or print the required array or -1 if no such array exists. The length of the array, if it exists, should be at most 200, and all elements of the array should be integers in the range [-10^9, 10^9].

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the provided program and the problem to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
- We need to construct an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
- An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
- The array should be constructed such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).
- If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should print \(-1\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the integer \( X \) for the current test case.
   - It subtracts 1 from \( X \) to handle the case where an empty subsequence is considered.
   - It initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of the subsequences.
   - It also initializes `mx` to keep track of the maximum length of the subsequences.

3. **Subsequence Length Calculation:**
   - The program enters a loop to decompose \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1.
   - For each iteration, it finds the largest \( i \) such that \( 2^{(i+1)} \leq x + 1 \).
   - It appends \( i \) to `subseq_lens` and subtracts \( 2^i - 1 \) from \( x \).
   - It updates `mx` to the maximum value of `i` found so far.

4. **Array Construction:**
   - The program constructs an array `ansv` with elements from 0 to `mx-1`.
   - It then appends the elements from `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.
   - It prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Subsequence Length Calculation:**
   - The loop correctly decomposes \( X - 1 \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1.
   - This is a valid approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of such terms.

2. **Array Construction:**
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by first adding elements from 0 to `mx-1`.
   - Then, it appends the lengths from `subseq_lens`.
   - This ensures that the array has the required number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the length of the array and the array itself, which matches the required output format.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1, which should return \(-1\) because an array with exactly 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence) is impossible.
   - The program does not handle the case where the constructed array exceeds the length of 200.

### Conclusion:
- The program is mostly correct in its approach to decompose \( X - 1 \) and construct the array.
- However, it fails to handle the edge case where \( X = 1 \) and does not check if the constructed array exceeds the length of 200.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the edge case where \( X = 1 \) and does not ensure that the constructed array does not exceed the length of 200.
