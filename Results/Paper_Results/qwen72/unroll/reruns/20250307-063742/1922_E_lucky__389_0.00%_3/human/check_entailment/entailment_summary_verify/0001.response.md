### Reasoning:

1. **Subsequence Length Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly decomposes \( X - 1 \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1. This is a valid approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of such terms.
   - The loop continues until \( x \) becomes 0, ensuring that all parts of \( X - 1 \) are accounted for.

2. **Array Construction:**
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by first adding elements from 0 to `mx-1`. This ensures that the initial part of the array is strictly increasing.
   - Then, it appends the lengths from `subseq_lens`. This ensures that the array has the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The constructed array is printed in the correct format: the length of the array followed by the elements.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X = 1 \). According to the problem, an array with exactly 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence) is impossible, and the program should print \(-1\). However, the current implementation does not check for this condition.
   - The program does not check if the constructed array exceeds the length of 200. If the number of elements in `ansv` exceeds 200, the program should print \(-1\).

4. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_1`, including the decomposition of \( X - 1 \) and the construction of the array.
   - The summary also mentions that the final state of the program is \( x = 0 \), `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the sub-sequences, `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`, and `ansv` is the list of integers as described.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the program. The program fails to handle the edge case where \( X = 1 \) and does not ensure that the constructed array does not exceed the length of 200. These are critical issues that need to be addressed to make the program correct.

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the edge case where \( X = 1 \) and does not check if the constructed array exceeds the length of 200.
