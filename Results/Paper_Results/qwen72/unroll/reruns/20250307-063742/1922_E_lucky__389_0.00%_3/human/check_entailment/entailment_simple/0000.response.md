Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one. This is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Reading `X`**: Inside `func_1`, the program reads the integer `X` for the current test case.
   - **Adjusting `X`**: The program subtracts 1 from `X` to handle the fact that an empty subsequence is also considered increasing. This is a valid approach because the problem states that an empty subsequence is included in the count of increasing subsequences.
   - **Finding Subsequence Lengths**:
     - The program uses a loop to find the lengths of sub-sequences that can be used to construct the array.
     - It repeatedly finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x + 1` and subtracts the corresponding value from `x`.
     - The lengths of these sub-sequences are stored in `subseq_lens`, and `mx` is updated to keep track of the maximum length.
   - **Constructing the Array**:
     - The program constructs the array `ansv` by first adding integers from 0 to `mx-1`.
     - It then appends the lengths of the sub-sequences (except the first one) to `ansv`.
   - **Output**:
     - The program prints the length of `ansv` and then prints the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm aims to construct an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences by using the properties of powers of 2.
   - The idea is to decompose `X-1` into a sum of distinct powers of 2, which corresponds to the lengths of the sub-sequences.
   - The array is constructed by adding elements in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `X` is 2 by subtracting 1 and then checking if `x` is 0, which it will be, and thus it correctly prints a single element array.
   - The program should also handle larger values of `X` by decomposing `X-1` into a sum of distinct powers of 2, which it does.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The program prints the length of the array and the array itself, which is consistent with the problem statement.
   - The elements of the array are within the specified range [-10^9, 10^9].

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `X` is 1, which is outside the given range (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). However, since the problem specifies that `X` is at least 2, this is not a concern.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the length of the array exceeds 200, but given the constraints and the way the algorithm works, the length should not exceed 200.

Given the reasoning above, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
