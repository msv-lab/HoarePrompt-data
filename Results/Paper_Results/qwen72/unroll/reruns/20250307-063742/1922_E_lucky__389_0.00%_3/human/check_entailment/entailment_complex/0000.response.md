Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - **Reading `X`**: The function reads an integer `x` from the input, which is the value of `X` for the current test case.
   - **Adjusting `X`**: The function subtracts 1 from `x` to handle the fact that the number of increasing subsequences is `x + 1` (since `x` is the number of non-empty increasing subsequences, and we need to include the empty subsequence).
   - **Generating Subsequences**:
     - The function uses a loop to find the lengths of the sub-sequences that can be formed to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.
     - It repeatedly finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x + 1` and subtracts the corresponding value from `x`. This is a correct approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of powers of 2 minus 1.
     - The lengths of these sub-sequences are stored in `subseq_lens`.
     - The maximum length of any sub-sequence is stored in `mx`.

3. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The function constructs an array `ansv` that starts with integers from 0 to `mx-1`.
   - It then appends the lengths of the sub-sequences from `subseq_lens` (excluding the first one) to `ansv`.
   - This construction ensures that the array has the required number of increasing subsequences. The initial part of the array (0 to `mx-1`) forms the base, and the appended lengths ensure the correct count of subsequences.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of `ansv` and then prints the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces.
   - If the function cannot find a valid array (which should not happen given the constraints and the logic), it should print `-1`. However, the program does not explicitly handle the case where `x` cannot be reduced to 0, but the logic ensures that `x` will always be reduced to 0 if a valid array can be constructed.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `X` is 2 correctly by printing a single element array.
   - The program also handles larger values of `X` by breaking down `X` into a sum of powers of 2, which is a valid approach for generating the required number of increasing subsequences.

6. **Constraints**:
   - The length of the array is at most 200, which is within the problem's constraints.
   - The elements of the array are integers in the range [-10^9, 10^9], which is also within the problem's constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
