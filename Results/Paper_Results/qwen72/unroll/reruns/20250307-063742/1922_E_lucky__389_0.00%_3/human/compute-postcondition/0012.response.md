To determine what will be printed by the `print()` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

### Initial State:
- The loop prints all the integers from 0 to `mx-1` followed by all the integers in `subseq_lens` except the first one, separated by spaces.
- The values of `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx` remain unchanged.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Output**: The loop prints a sequence of integers from 0 to `mx-1` followed by all the integers in `subseq_lens` except the first one. This means that the loop will generate a string of numbers separated by spaces.
2. **Print Statement**: The `print()` statement is called after the loop, but it does not contain any arguments. Therefore, it will print an empty line.

### Explanation:
- The loop prints a sequence of numbers, but since the `print()` statement after the loop does not contain any arguments, it will simply print a newline character, effectively creating an empty line.

### Final Output:
Output: **(an empty line)**
