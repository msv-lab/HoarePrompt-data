Output State: **The function `func_1` is intended to handle multiple test cases, each with a single integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), and the function should return or print the required array or -1 if no such array exists. The length of the array, if it exists, should be at most 200, and all elements of the array should be integers in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `x` is an input integer, and `x` is now `x - 1`. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0.**
