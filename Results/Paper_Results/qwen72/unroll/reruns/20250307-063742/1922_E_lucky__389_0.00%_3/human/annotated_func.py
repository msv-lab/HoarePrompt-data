#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to handle multiple test cases, each with a single integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), and the function should return or print the required array or -1 if no such array exists. The length of the array, if it exists, should be at most 200, and all elements of the array should be integers in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing integers representing the lengths of the sub-sequences, and `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing integers representing the lengths of the sub-sequences, `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`, `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx-1` followed by all the integers in `subseq_lens` except the first one.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: - The `print(len(ansv))` statement will print the length of the list `ansv`.
    #   - Based on the initial state, the length of `ansv` is `mx + (len(subseq_lens) - 1)`.
    #
    #Output:
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: The loop prints all the integers from 0 to `mx-1` followed by all the integers in `subseq_lens` except the first one, separated by spaces. The values of `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the user input (where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). It then processes `X` to generate a list `ansv` that contains integers from 0 to `mx-1` followed by the lengths of sub-sequences derived from `X`. The function prints the length of `ansv` and then prints all the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces. If no valid sub-sequences can be generated, the function prints -1. The final state of the program is that `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the sub-sequences, `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`, and `ansv` is the list of integers as described.
