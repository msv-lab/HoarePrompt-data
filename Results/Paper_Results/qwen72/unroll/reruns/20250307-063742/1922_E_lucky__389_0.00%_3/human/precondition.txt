The function `solve` is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves a positive integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or return -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array, if it exists, should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
