The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `subseq_lens`. The loop will execute if `subseq_lens` has at least 2 elements because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `len(subseq_lens) - 1`. For the loop to execute, `subseq_lens` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` should start at 1.

State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing integers representing the lengths of the sub-sequences that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`, `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx-1`**
