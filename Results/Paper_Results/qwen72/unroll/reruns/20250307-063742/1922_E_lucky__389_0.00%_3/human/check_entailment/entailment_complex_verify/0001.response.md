### Reasoning:

1. **Subsequence Length Calculation:**
   - The function correctly decomposes \( X - 1 \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1. This is a valid approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of such terms.
   - The loop finds the largest \( i \) such that \( 2^{(i+1)} \leq x + 1 \) and appends \( i \) to `subseq_lens`, then subtracts \( 2^i - 1 \) from \( x \). This ensures that \( x \) is reduced correctly and the subsequence lengths are stored.

2. **Array Construction:**
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by first adding elements from 0 to `mx-1`. This ensures that the initial part of the array is strictly increasing.
   - Then, it appends the elements from `subseq_lens` to `ansv`. This ensures that the array has the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The length of `ansv` is printed, followed by the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces, which matches the required output format.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not handle the case where \( X = 1 \). For \( X = 1 \), the only increasing subsequence is the empty subsequence, and no array can achieve exactly one increasing subsequence (since the empty subsequence is always present). Therefore, the program should print \(-1\) for \( X = 1 \).
   - The program also does not check if the constructed array exceeds the length of 200. This is a valid concern because the problem specifies that the array length should be at most 200. If the constructed array exceeds this length, the program should print \(-1\).

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the two main issues:
1. The program does not handle the case where \( X = 1 \).
2. The program does not ensure that the constructed array does not exceed the length of 200.

These issues are significant and can lead to incorrect outputs for certain test cases. Therefore, the program is not fully correct as per the problem requirements.

Final: **False**
