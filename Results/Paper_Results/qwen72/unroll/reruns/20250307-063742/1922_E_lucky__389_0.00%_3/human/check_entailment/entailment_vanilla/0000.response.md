Let's break down the provided program and the problem to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
- We need to construct an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
- An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
- The array should be constructed such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).
- If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should print \(-1\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the integer \( X \) for the current test case.
   - It subtracts 1 from \( X \) to handle the case where an empty subsequence is considered.
   - It initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of the subsequences.
   - It also initializes `mx` to keep track of the maximum length of the subsequences.

3. **Subsequence Length Calculation:**
   - The program enters a loop to decompose \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1.
   - For each iteration, it finds the largest \( i \) such that \( 2^{(i+1)} \leq x + 1 \).
   - It appends \( i \) to `subseq_lens` and subtracts \( 2^i - 1 \) from \( x \).
   - It updates `mx` to the maximum value of `i` found so far.

4. **Array Construction:**
   - The program constructs an array `ansv` with elements from 0 to `mx-1`.
   - It then appends the elements from `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.
   - It prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Subsequence Length Calculation:**
   - The loop correctly decomposes \( X - 1 \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1.
   - This is a valid approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of such terms.

2. **Array Construction:**
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by first adding elements from 0 to `mx-1`.
   - Then, it appends the lengths from `subseq_lens`.
   - This ensures that the array has the required number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the length of the array and the array itself, which matches the required output format.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1, which should return \(-1\) because an array with exactly 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence) is impossible.
   - The program does not handle the case where the constructed array exceeds the length of 200.

### Conclusion:
- The program is mostly correct in its approach to decompose \( X - 1 \) and construct the array.
- However, it fails to handle the edge case where \( X = 1 \) and does not check if the constructed array exceeds the length of 200.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the edge case where \( X = 1 \) and does not ensure that the constructed array does not exceed the length of 200.
