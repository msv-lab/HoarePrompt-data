Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

        else:

            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]

        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])

# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the user input (where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). It then processes `X` to generate a list `ansv` that contains integers from 0 to `mx-1` followed by the lengths of sub-sequences derived from `X`. The function prints the length of `ansv` and then prints all the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces. If no valid sub-sequences can be generated, the function prints -1. The final state of the program is that `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the sub-sequences, `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`, and `ansv` is the list of integers as described.
