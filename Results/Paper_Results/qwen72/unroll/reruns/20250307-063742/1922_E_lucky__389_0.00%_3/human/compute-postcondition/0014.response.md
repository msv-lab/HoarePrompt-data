Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the user input (where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). It then processes `X` to generate a list `ansv` that contains integers from 0 to `mx-1` followed by the lengths of sub-sequences derived from `X`. The function prints the length of `ansv` and then prints all the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces. If no valid sub-sequences can be generated, the function prints -1. The final state of the program is that `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the sub-sequences, `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`, and `ansv` is the list of integers as described. **
