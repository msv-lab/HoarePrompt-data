The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, respectively, where `n` is the length of the list `a` and `k` is a parameter used in the function's logic. `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns a result based on the processing of these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the elements of `a`.**
