Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `x`, and the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic is implemented correctly. The loop continues until `r - l` is 1, and the middle index `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`. The conditions for updating `l` and `r` are also correct:
   - If `array[mid] <= find`, then `l` is updated to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid`.

3. **Final Check**: After the binary search loop, the program checks if `l` is the index of `find` in the array. If `l` is not the index of `find`, it prints `1` and returns a list of two strings representing the indices to swap. If `l` is the index of `find`, it prints `0`.

4. **Swapping Logic**: The function `func_1` is designed to return the indices to swap to ensure that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position. The logic for swapping is:
   - If `l` is not the index of `find`, it returns the indices `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1` to swap the elements at these positions.

5. **Output Format**: The output format matches the problem description. For each test case, the program prints the number of operations and the indices to swap if needed.

However, there is a subtle issue with the binary search logic:
- The initial values for `l` and `r` are `0` and `n`, respectively. This means that the first `mid` calculated is `n // 2`, which is correct. However, the problem description suggests that `l` should start at `1` and `r` at `n + 1`. This discrepancy might lead to incorrect behavior if the array is not zero-indexed as expected by the binary search.

Given the problem constraints and the fact that the array is zero-indexed in Python, the current implementation should work correctly. However, for consistency with the problem statement, the initial values of `l` and `r` should be `1` and `n + 1` respectively, and the array should be adjusted to be one-indexed.

Despite this, the current implementation is functionally correct for the given problem constraints and inputs.

Correctness: **True**
