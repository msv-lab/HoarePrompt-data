Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem by performing a binary search on the given permutation and allowing up to two swaps to ensure that the binary search finds the correct element. However, the provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic for swapping elements to prepare the array for binary search. Instead, it only checks if the binary search result `l` is the same as the index of the element `find` in the array and prints the number of swaps needed (0 or 1) and the indices to swap. This approach is flawed because:

1. **Binary Search on Unsorted Array**: Binary search is only effective on sorted arrays. The function `func_1` performs binary search on an unsorted permutation, which can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The function does not actually perform the swaps. It only identifies a potential swap if the binary search result `l` is not the correct index of `find`. However, the problem requires that the swaps be performed before the binary search to ensure the correct result.

3. **Output Format**: The function prints the number of swaps directly, but the problem specifies that the number of swaps should be printed on the first line of the output for each test case, followed by the indices of the swaps on subsequent lines. The function should return the number of swaps and the indices, and the main loop should handle the printing.

4. **Handling Multiple Swaps**: The function only considers a single swap, but the problem allows for up to two swaps. The function should be able to handle and return up to two swaps if necessary.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
