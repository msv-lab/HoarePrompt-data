Output State: **`l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`, and `r` is the smallest index such that `array[r] > find`.**

In natural language, after the loop finishes executing, the variable `l` will hold the index of the largest element in `array` that is less than or equal to `find`, and `r` will hold the index of the smallest element in `array` that is greater than `find`. If `find` is exactly equal to an element in `array`, `l` will point to that element. If `find` is not in `array`, `l` will point to the element just before where `find` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order, and `r` will point to the element just after where `find` would be inserted.
