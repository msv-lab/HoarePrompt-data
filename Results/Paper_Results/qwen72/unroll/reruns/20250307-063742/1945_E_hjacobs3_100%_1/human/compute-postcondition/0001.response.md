Output State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n (a permutation of size n), `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`.** 

The initial state remains unchanged except for the new assignments to `l` and `r`. `l` is now 0, and `r` is now equal to the length of `array`, which is `n`.
