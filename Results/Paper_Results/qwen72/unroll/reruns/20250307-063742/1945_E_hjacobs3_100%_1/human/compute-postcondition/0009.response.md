The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array` and `find`. `array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n (a permutation of size n), and `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n. The function returns a list containing two string values: the first value is the string representation of `l + 1`, where `l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`; the second value is the string representation of the index of `find` in the array plus 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `array` of distinct integers from 1 to n and an integer `find` such that 1 <= find <= n. It returns a list of two strings: the first string is the largest index `l` in `array` where `array[l] <= find`, incremented by 1; the second string is the index of `find` in `array`, also incremented by 1.**
