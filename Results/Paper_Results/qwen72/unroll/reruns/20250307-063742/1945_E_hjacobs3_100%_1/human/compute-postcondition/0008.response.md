The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state describes the variables `l` and `r`:
  - `l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`.
  - `r` is the smallest index such that `array[r] > find`.
  - `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`.

- However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the integer `0`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the integer `0`, regardless of the values of `l`, `r`, `array`, and `find`.

Output: **0**
