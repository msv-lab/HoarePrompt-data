### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
   - We can perform up to 2 swaps in the permutation before applying binary search.
   - The goal is to ensure that after binary search, `p_l` equals `x`.

2. **Binary Search in Permutations**:
   - Binary search works efficiently on sorted arrays. In a permutation, the elements are distinct and range from 1 to `n`, but they are not necessarily sorted.
   - The provided binary search algorithm is designed to find the largest index `l` such that `array[l] <= find` and the smallest index `r` such that `array[r] > find`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the permutation `array` and the number `find` as inputs.
   - It initializes `l` and `r` to 0 and `n` respectively.
   - It then performs a binary search to find the indices `l` and `r` as described.
   - After the binary search, it checks if `l` is the index of `find` in the array.
   - If `l` is not the index of `find`, it prints 1 and returns a list with the indices to swap to correct the position of `find`.
   - If `l` is the index of `find`, it prints 0, indicating no swaps are needed.

4. **Correctness of the Binary Search**:
   - The binary search algorithm is correctly implemented to find the largest `l` such that `array[l] <= find` and the smallest `r` such that `array[r] > find`.
   - However, the binary search is not guaranteed to find the correct position of `find` in an unsorted permutation.

5. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function correctly identifies when `l` is not the index of `find` and returns the indices to swap.
   - The swap is intended to move `find` to the correct position in the array, which is `l`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `find` is already at the correct position by printing 0.
   - The function also handles the case where `find` is not at the correct position by printing 1 and returning the indices to swap.

7. **Overall Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to work with the given constraints and problem description.
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the required number of swaps and their indices.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided. It correctly identifies the need for swaps and performs the necessary operations to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` equals `x`.

Correctness: **True**
