### Reasoning:

Let's break down the original assessment and the function summary to evaluate the correctness of the program.

1. **Binary Search Initialization:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the binary search initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n`, which is different from the problem description that suggests initializing `l` to 1 and `r` to `n + 1`.
   - This discrepancy can indeed lead to incorrect results because the binary search will not correctly handle the range from 1 to `n`.

2. **Indexing in Binary Search:**
   - The program uses 0-based indexing for the array, but the problem description uses 1-based indexing.
   - This means that the indices returned by the function will be off by 1, which is a significant issue.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program prints the number of operations (0 or 1) inside the function `func_1`, but it should print this number outside the function.
   - The function `func_1` should return the number of operations and the indices to swap, and the main loop should handle the printing.

4. **Handling Multiple Swaps:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program only handles one swap, but the problem allows for up to 2 swaps.
   - The function `func_1` should be designed to handle up to 2 swaps if necessary.

### Evaluation of the Function Summary:
- The function summary describes the behavior of `func_1` as returning a list of two strings: the first string is the string representation of `l + 1`, and the second string is the string representation of the index of `find` in the array plus 1.
- However, this summary is incomplete and does not account for the possibility of performing up to 2 swaps.
- The function should return a tuple containing the number of swaps and a list of swap operations.

### Corrected Program:
The corrected program provided in the original assessment addresses the issues identified:
- It initializes `l` to 1 and `r` to `n + 1`.
- It uses 1-based indexing for the output.
- It handles up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search finds the correct value.
- The output format is correct as per the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the initial program and provides a corrected version that addresses these issues. The corrected program is indeed correct and meets the problem requirements.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **True**
