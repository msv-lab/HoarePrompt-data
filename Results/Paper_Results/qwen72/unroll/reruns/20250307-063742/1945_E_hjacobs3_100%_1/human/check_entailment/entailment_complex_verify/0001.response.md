### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Initialization:**
   - The original program initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n`, which is incorrect based on the problem description that suggests `l` should be 1 and `r` should be `n + 1`.
   - This discrepancy can lead to incorrect results because the binary search will not correctly handle the range from 1 to `n`.

2. **Indexing in Binary Search:**
   - The original program uses 0-based indexing for the array, but the problem description uses 1-based indexing.
   - This means that the indices returned by the function will be off by 1, which is a significant issue.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The original program prints the number of operations (0 or 1) inside the function `func_1`, but it should print this number outside the function.
   - The function `func_1` should return the number of operations and the indices to swap, and the main loop should handle the printing.

4. **Handling Multiple Swaps:**
   - The original program only handles one swap, but the problem allows for up to 2 swaps.
   - The function `func_1` should be designed to handle up to 2 swaps if necessary.

### Annotations and Program Behavior:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n (a permutation of size n), and `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n.
- **State after the binary search loop:**
  - `l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`, and `r` is the smallest index such that `array[r] > find`.
- **Post-Search Check:**
  - The program checks if `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`.
  - If not, it prints 1 and returns the indices to swap `l` and the index of `find`.
  - If `l` is already the index of `find`, it prints 0.

### Evaluation:
- **Binary Search Initialization:**
  - The original program's initialization of `l` and `r` is incorrect. The corrected program initializes `l` to 1 and `r` to `n + 1`, which aligns with the problem description.
- **Indexing in Binary Search:**
  - The original program uses 0-based indexing, which is incorrect. The corrected program uses 1-based indexing for the output, ensuring the indices are correct.
- **Output Format:**
  - The original program prints the number of operations inside the function, which is incorrect. The corrected program returns the number of operations and the indices to swap, and the main loop handles the printing.
- **Handling Multiple Swaps:**
  - The original program only handles one swap, which is insufficient. The corrected program handles up to 2 swaps, ensuring the binary search can find the correct value.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified the issues with the program. The corrected program addresses these issues and is correct according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the issues identified and discussed. The corrected program, however, is correct.
