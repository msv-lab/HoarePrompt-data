The function `func_1` accepts a list `array` of distinct integers from 1 to n and an integer `find` such that 1 <= find <= n. It returns a list of two strings: the first string is the string representation of `l + 1`, where `l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`; the second string is the string representation of the index of `find` in the array plus 1. If `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array, the function prints `1` and returns the list. If `l` is equal to the index of `find` in the array, the function prints `0` and returns the list.
