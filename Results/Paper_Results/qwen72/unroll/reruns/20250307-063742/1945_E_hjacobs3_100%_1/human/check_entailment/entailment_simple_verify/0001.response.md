Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program:
1. **Binary Search Initialization**: The program initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n`, which is incorrect according to the problem description that suggests `l` should be 1 and `r` should be `n + 1`. This discrepancy can indeed lead to incorrect results.
2. **Indexing in Binary Search**: The program uses 0-based indexing, but the problem description uses 1-based indexing. This means the indices returned by the function will be off by 1, which is a significant issue.
3. **Output Format**: The program prints the number of operations inside the function `func_1`, but it should print this number outside the function. The function should return the number of operations and the indices to swap, and the main loop should handle the printing.
4. **Handling Multiple Swaps**: The program only handles one swap, but the problem allows for up to 2 swaps. The function `func_1` should be designed to handle up to 2 swaps if necessary.

The corrected program addresses these issues:
- Initializes `l` to 1 and `r` to `n + 1`.
- Adjusts the indices to be 1-based.
- Ensures the function returns the number of operations and the indices to swap.
- Handles up to 2 swaps if necessary.

The corrected program is indeed correct and aligns with the problem requirements. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues, and the corrected program is the appropriate solution.

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect, and the corrected program is the correct solution.)
