To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `r - l > 1`.

### Current State:
- `array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n (a permutation of size n).
- `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n.
- `n` is the length of `array`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n`.

### Condition Analysis:
The loop condition is `r - l > 1`. Let's evaluate this condition with the current state:
- `r` is `n`.
- `l` is 0.

So, the condition becomes:
- `n - 0 > 1` or `n > 1`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 1. Since `n` is the length of `array`, and `array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
No other states need to be adjusted because the condition `r - l > 1` is already satisfied if `n > 1`.

State: **`array` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n (a permutation of size n), `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of `array` and must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`**
