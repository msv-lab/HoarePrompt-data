Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic is flawed. The binary search should be performed on the modified array after the necessary swaps, but the current implementation performs the binary search on the original array and then tries to swap elements based on the result. This is incorrect because the swaps should be done before the binary search to ensure the array is in a state where the binary search can find the element correctly.

2. **Output Format**: The output format is incorrect. The program should output the number of operations followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped, but the current implementation prints the number of operations inside the function `func_1`, which is not the correct place for it. The number of operations should be printed outside the function, and the indices should be returned as a list of strings.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program does not handle the output for multiple test cases correctly. It should print the number of operations and the indices for each test case, but the current implementation does not ensure this.

4. **Correctness of Swaps**: The program does not correctly determine the swaps needed to make the binary search work. It only checks if the binary search result is not the correct index and then performs a swap, but it does not ensure that the array is in a state where the binary search will work correctly after the swaps.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
- Identify the correct position `pos` of the element `x` in the permutation.
- Perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position.
- After the swaps, perform the binary search to verify that `p_l` is equal to `x`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    print(len(res))
    for swap in res:
        print(' '.join(map(str, swap)))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    pos = array.index(find)
    
    # Binary search on the original array to find the current position of the search
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    # If the element is already in the correct position, no swaps needed
    if l == pos:
        return []
    
    # If the element is not in the correct position, perform the necessary swaps
    swaps = []
    if l != pos:
        swaps.append((l + 1, pos + 1))
        array[l], array[pos] = array[pos], array[l]
        (l, r) = (0, n)
        while r - l > 1:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if array[mid] <= find:
                l = mid
            else:
                r = mid
        if l != pos:
            # Perform a second swap if necessary
            for i in range(n):
                if array[i] > find and i < pos:
                    swaps.append((i + 1, pos + 1))
                    array[i], array[pos] = array[pos], array[i]
                    break
    
    return swaps
```

This corrected version ensures that the binary search will find the element `x` at the correct position after performing up to 2 swaps.
