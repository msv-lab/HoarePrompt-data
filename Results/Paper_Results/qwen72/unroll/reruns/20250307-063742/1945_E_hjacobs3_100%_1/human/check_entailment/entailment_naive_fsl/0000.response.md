Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the binary search and the required swaps to ensure the binary search works as expected. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```

Expected Output:
```
2
4 5
2 4
```

Actual Output:
```
1
1 3
```

The program incorrectly assumes that a single swap will always be sufficient to align the target value with the binary search result. However, in the given case, a single swap is not enough to ensure that the binary search will find the correct position for `x = 3`. The correct approach would involve potentially two swaps to rearrange the permutation so that the binary search can correctly identify the position of `x`.
