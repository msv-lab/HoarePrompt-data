The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop condition is `i < n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `i` is 0

Since `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer, the condition `i < n` will always be true for the first iteration. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1', `counter` is 0, `i` is 0**
