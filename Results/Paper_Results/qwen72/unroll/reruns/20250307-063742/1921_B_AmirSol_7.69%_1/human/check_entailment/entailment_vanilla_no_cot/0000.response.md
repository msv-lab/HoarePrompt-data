Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading the number of boxes, the initial state of the boxes, and the desired state of the boxes. The function `func_1` calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state into the desired state. The logic within `func_1` is designed to efficiently count the necessary operations by considering both single and paired mismatches between the initial and desired states, which aligns with the problem's constraints and requirements. The output format matches the expected output for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
