The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function returns the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` containing only '0' and '1'. It returns the number of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ.**
