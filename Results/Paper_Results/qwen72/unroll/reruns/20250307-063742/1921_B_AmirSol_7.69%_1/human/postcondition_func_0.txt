The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` containing only '0' and '1'. It returns the number of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ, with a special case where if two consecutive differing characters in `s1` and `s2` are also different from each other, they are counted as a single difference. After the function concludes, `counter` holds the total count of such differences, and `i` is equal to `n`.
