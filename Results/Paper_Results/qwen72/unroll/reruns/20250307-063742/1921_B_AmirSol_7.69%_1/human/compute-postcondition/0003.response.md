Output State: **`counter` is the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, and `i` is `n`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates through the strings `s1` and `s2` character by character.
- If the characters at the current position `i` in `s1` and `s2` are different (`s1[i] != s2[i]`), the loop checks if the next character (at position `i + 1`) also differs and if the current character in `s1` is different from the next character in `s1`.
  - If both conditions are true, `counter` is incremented by 1, and `i` is incremented by 2, effectively skipping the next character.
  - If either condition is false, `counter` is incremented by 1, and `i` is incremented by 1.
- If the characters at the current position `i` in `s1` and `s2` are the same (`s1[i] == s2[i]`), `i` is simply incremented by 1.
- The loop continues until `i` reaches `n`, meaning all characters in the strings have been checked.
- Therefore, after the loop finishes, `counter` will hold the total number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, and `i` will be equal to `n`.
