Output State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists.**

The code initializes three new lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` to empty lists. The values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain unchanged, and `numbers` is still a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.
