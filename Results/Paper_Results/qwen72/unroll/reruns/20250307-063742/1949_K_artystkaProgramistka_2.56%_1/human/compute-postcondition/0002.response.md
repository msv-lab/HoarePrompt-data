Output State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the new variables `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c`, which are all initialized to 0.
