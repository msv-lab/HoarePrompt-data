Postcondition: **`group_a` contains `na` numbers, `group_b` contains `nb` numbers, `group_c` contains `nc` numbers, `sum_a` is the sum of the numbers in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the numbers in `group_b`, and `sum_c` is the sum of the numbers in `group_c`. The function `func_1` applied to `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` returns `True`.**
