The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`. `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).

The function returns one of two cases:
- Case_1: If the function can successfully partition the `numbers` list into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`) such that `group_a` contains `na` numbers, `group_b` contains `nb` numbers, and `group_c` contains `nc` numbers, it returns 'YES' along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`.
- Case_2: If the function cannot partition the `numbers` list as described, it returns 'NO'.

Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. It returns 'YES' and the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` if it can partition the `numbers` list into three groups with `na`, `nb`, and `nc` numbers respectively. If it cannot partition the list as required, it returns 'NO'.**
