Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, a is a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, q is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, and each query (l, r) is a pair of integers where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. R is a function that reads a line of input and returns an iterator of integers. t has been assigned the first integer from the iterator returned by R.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    *_, k = R()
    a = {*R()}
    b = {*R()}
    f = 1
    m = n = k // 2
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        u = i in a
        v = i in b
        f &= u | v
        m -= u & ~v
        n -= ~u & v
    print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
