Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Misinterpretation of Input and Problem Requirements**:
   - The program reads the input in a way that does not match the problem description. Specifically, it reads the length of the array and the array itself, but then it reads the queries in a way that does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The program uses sets `a` and `b` to store the elements of the array, which is not appropriate for this problem. Sets do not preserve the order of elements, and they do not allow duplicate elements, which is crucial for the problem since we need to find indices of different elements within a specified range.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The program uses a variable `k` which is not defined in the problem statement. It seems to be a misinterpretation of the input.
   - The program uses bitwise operations and logical operators in a way that does not correspond to the problem's requirements. For example, `f &= u | v` and `m -= u & ~v` are not relevant to finding pairs of different elements within a range.
   - The output `print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])` is not correct for the problem. The problem requires outputting indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists, but the program is outputting a string based on some bitwise logic.

3. **Expected Solution**:
   - The correct approach would involve reading the array and the queries as specified, and then for each query, checking if there are any two different elements within the specified range. If such elements exist, output their indices; otherwise, output `-1 -1`.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for the problem described.

Correctness: **False**
