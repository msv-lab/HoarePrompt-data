Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Summary:
- We are given an array `a` of `n` integers and `q` queries.
- Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n).
- For each query, we need to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `l ≤ i ≤ r`, `l ≤ j ≤ r`, and `a[i] ≠ a[j]`.
- If such a pair does not exist, we should output `-1 -1`.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (*_, k) = R()
        a = {*R()}
        b = {*R()}
        f = 1
        m = n = k // 2
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            u = i in a
            v = i in b
            f &= u | v
            m -= u & ~v
            n -= ~u & v
        print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `R()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `k` (which should be `n` based on the problem description).
   - It then reads the array `a` and another set `b` (which is not mentioned in the problem description and seems out of place).

2. **Set Operations**:
   - The program uses sets `a` and `b` to store the elements read from the input.
   - It initializes a flag `f` to 1 and two variables `m` and `n` to `k // 2`.

3. **Loop and Conditions**:
   - The program iterates from 1 to `k` (inclusive).
   - For each `i`, it checks if `i` is in set `a` (`u = i in a`) and if `i` is in set `b` (`v = i in b`).
   - It updates the flag `f` using bitwise operations: `f &= u | v`.
   - It updates `m` and `n` using bitwise operations: `m -= u & ~v` and `n -= ~u & v`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints a string `'YNEOS'` sliced based on the conditions `f ^ 1` or `m | n < 0`.

### Issues and Incorrectness:
1. **Incorrect Use of Sets**:
   - The problem requires working with an array `a` and finding indices `i` and `j` such that `a[i] ≠ a[j]` within a given range. The program uses sets `a` and `b`, which do not preserve the order of elements and do not allow for index-based access.

2. **Unnecessary Variables**:
   - The variables `m` and `n` are initialized to `k // 2` and are updated using bitwise operations, which are not relevant to the problem of finding distinct elements in a subarray.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic involving `f`, `m`, and `n` does not address the problem of finding distinct elements in the subarray. The program seems to be checking if all elements from 1 to `k` are present in either `a` or `b`, which is not the required task.

4. **Output Mismatch**:
   - The program outputs a string `'YNEOS'` based on the conditions, which does not match the required output format of indices or `-1 -1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. It uses sets and bitwise operations in a way that does not align with the task of finding distinct elements in a subarray.

Correctness: **False**
