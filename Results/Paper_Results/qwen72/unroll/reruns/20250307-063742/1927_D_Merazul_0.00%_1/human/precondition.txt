t is an integer such that 1 \le t \le 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 1 \le a_i \le 10^6, q is an integer such that 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5, and each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 \le l < r \le n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
