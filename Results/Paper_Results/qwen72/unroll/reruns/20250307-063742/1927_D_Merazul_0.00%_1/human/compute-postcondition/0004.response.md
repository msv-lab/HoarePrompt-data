The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a`: a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the elements of the list.
- `q`: an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of queries.
- `queries`: a list of pairs of integers (l, r) where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, representing the queries on the list `a`.

The function processes these inputs and returns the results of the queries. Each query (l, r) is processed to determine some property or value based on the sublist `a[l:r]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, and `queries`. It processes `q` queries on the list `a` and returns the results of these queries. Each query (l, r) is a pair of integers, and the function returns a result for each query based on the sublist `a[l:r]`.**
