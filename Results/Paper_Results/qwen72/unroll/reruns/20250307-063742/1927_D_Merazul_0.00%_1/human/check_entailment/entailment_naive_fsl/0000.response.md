Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. The problem requires finding two indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a specified range \([l, r]\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\). However, the given program seems to be attempting to solve a different problem, possibly related to set operations and boolean logic, which does not align with the requirements of the problem.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```
The expected output should be:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```
However, the provided program will not produce this output. The program's logic is not designed to handle the query-based approach required by the problem, and it does not even read the queries correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
