The function `func` reads input from the user, processes a series of queries on two sets of integers, and prints a result for each query. The function does not accept any parameters directly but reads them from standard input. It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it reads the size `k` and two sets of integers `a` and `b`. It then checks if each integer from 1 to `k` is present in either set `a` or `b`. If all integers from 1 to `k` are present in at least one of the sets, and the counts of integers in `a` and `b` are balanced, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function leaves the program state with `t = 0`, `f = 1`, `m = 0`, and `n = 0`.
