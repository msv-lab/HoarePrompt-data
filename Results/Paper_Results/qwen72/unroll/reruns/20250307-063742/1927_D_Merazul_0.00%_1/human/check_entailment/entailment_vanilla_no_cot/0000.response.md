Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding two indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a specified range \([l, r]\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\). The program, however, seems to be performing a different set of operations that do not align with this requirement. Here are a few specific issues:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program incorrectly parses the input. It uses a lambda function `R` to read integers, but it does not properly handle the structure of the input, especially for the array and queries.

2. **Set Operations**: The program uses sets `a` and `b` to store input values, but it does not maintain the indices of the elements, which are crucial for the problem.

3. **Logic for Finding Indices**: The program's logic for finding indices \(i\) and \(j\) is incorrect. It uses bitwise operations and set membership checks that do not correspond to the problem's requirements.

4. **Output Format**: The program outputs 'YNEOS' based on some bitwise operations, which is not the required output format. The correct output should be two indices or \(-1 -1\) if no such pair exists.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def find_indices():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        q = int(input())
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = map(int, input().split())
            found = False
            for i in range(l-1, r):
                for j in range(i+1, r):
                    if a[i] != a[j]:
                        print(i+1, j+1)
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                print(-1, -1)

find_indices()
```

This corrected version:
- Properly reads the input.
- Iterates through the specified range \([l, r]\) to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\).
- Outputs the correct indices or \(-1 -1\) if no such pair exists.
