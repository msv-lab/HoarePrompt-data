You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Program:
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (*_, k) = R()
        a = {*R()}
        b = {*R()}
        f = 1
        m = n = k // 2
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            u = i in a
            v = i in b
            f &= u | v
            m -= u & ~v
            n -= ~u & v
        print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads input from the user, processes a series of queries on two sets of integers, and prints a result for each query. The function does not accept any parameters directly but reads them from standard input. It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it reads the size `k` and two sets of integers `a` and `b`. It then checks if each integer from 1 to `k` is present in either set `a` or `b`. If all integers from 1 to `k` are present in at least one of the sets, and the counts of integers in `a` and `b` are balanced, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function leaves the program state with `t = 0`, `f = 1`, `m = 0`, and `n = 0`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. The problem requires finding two indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a specified range \([l, r]\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\). However, the given program seems to be attempting to solve a different problem, possibly related to set operations and boolean logic, which does not align with the requirements of the problem.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```
The expected output should be:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```
However, the provided program will not produce this output. The program's logic is not designed to handle the query-based approach required by the problem, and it does not even read the queries correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
