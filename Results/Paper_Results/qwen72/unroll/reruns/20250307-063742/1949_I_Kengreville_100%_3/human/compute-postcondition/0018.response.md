The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that there are predefined lists `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers with length `n`, where for each index `i`, -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9. `visited` and `coef` are lists of length `n`, initially all elements of `visited` are `False` and all elements of `coef` are `None`.

The function returns a list `coef` of length `n`, where each element is either a computed coefficient or remains `None` if the corresponding element in `visited` is `False`.
