Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `x` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `None`, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `None`, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `None`, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `None`.**

The code snippet `visited = [False] * n` reinitializes the `visited` list to a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`. Since this is the same as the initial state of `visited`, no changes are made to the overall state of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
