Postcondition: **`x` is a list of length `n` with all elements being integers, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements being integers, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements being integers, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `True`, `coef` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `1` or `None`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True` or `False`, `ok` is `True`. Additionally, there exists at least one index `i` in the loop where `bipartite[i]` is `True` and `tot[i]` is not `0`.**
