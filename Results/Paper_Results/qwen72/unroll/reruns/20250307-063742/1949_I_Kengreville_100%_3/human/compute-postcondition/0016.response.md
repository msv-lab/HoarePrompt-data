Based on the initial state provided, the variables and objects are as follows:
- `x` is a list of length `n` with all elements being integers.
- `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements being integers.
- `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements being integers.
- `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `True`.
- `coef` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `1` or `None`.
- `tot` is 0.
- `bipartite` is `True` or `False`.
- `ok` is `False`.

The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:
```
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement will print the string `'NO'` directly, regardless of the values of the variables and objects described in the initial state.

Output: **NO**
