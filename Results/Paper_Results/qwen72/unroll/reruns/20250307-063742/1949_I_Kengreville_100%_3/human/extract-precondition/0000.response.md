Precondition: **i is a non-negative integer representing the index of a disk, such that 0 <= i < n. n is a positive integer representing the number of disks, such that 1 <= n <= 1000. x and y are lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the disk centers, respectively, where -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. r is a list of positive integers representing the radii of the disks, where 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. visited, tot, and coef are lists of length n, where visited[i] is a boolean indicating if the i-th disk has been visited, tot is an integer representing the total sum of coefficients, and coef[i] is an integer representing the coefficient of the i-th disk. bipartite is a boolean indicating whether the graph is bipartite.**
