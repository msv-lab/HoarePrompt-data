Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `x` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `None`, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `None`, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `None`, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `None`.**

The code snippet `coef = [None] * n` reassigns the variable `coef` to a new list of length `n` where all elements are `None`. Since `coef` was already a list of length `n` with all elements being `None`, the state of `coef` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`) are not affected by this code snippet.
