Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `x` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `None`, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `None`, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `None`, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `None`.**

The code snippet `r = [None] * n` reassigns the list `r` to a new list of length `n` where all elements are `None`. The initial state specified that `r` was a list of integers with length `n`, but this has been overwritten by the new list of `None` values. All other variables remain unchanged.
