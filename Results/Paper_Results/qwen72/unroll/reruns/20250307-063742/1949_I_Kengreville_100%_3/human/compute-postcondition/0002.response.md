Output State: **n is an input integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of length n with all elements being None, y is a list of length n with all elements being None, r is a list of integers with length n, where for each i, -10^9 <= r[i] <= 10^9, visited is a list of length n with all elements being False, and coef is a list of length n with all elements being None.**

The code snippet `y = [None] * n` reassigns the list `y` to a new list of length `n` with all elements being `None`. The other variables remain unchanged.
