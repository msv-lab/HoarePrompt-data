The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0**
