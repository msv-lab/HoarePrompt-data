Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `x` is a list of length `n` with all elements being integers.
- `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements being integers.
- `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements being integers.
- `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `True`.
- `coef` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `1` or `None`.
- `tot` is a list of length `n` with all elements being integers, and at least one element is not `0`.
- `bipartite` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `True` or `False`, and at least one element is `True`.
- `ok` is `True`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides information about the variables and lists, but it does not affect the `print` statement directly.
- The condition that `ok` is `True` and there exists at least one index `i` where `bipartite[i]` is `True` and `tot[i]` is not `0` is given, but it does not influence the `print` statement since the statement is unconditional.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables and lists described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
