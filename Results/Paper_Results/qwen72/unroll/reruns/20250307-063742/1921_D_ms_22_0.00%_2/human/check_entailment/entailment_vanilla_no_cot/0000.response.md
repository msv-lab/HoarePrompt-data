Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a brief explanation of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually by reading `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting `b`**: The array `b` is sorted, which is a necessary step to ensure that the largest and smallest elements can be used to maximize the difference.

3. **Heap Initialization**: A max heap is used to store the differences between elements of `a` and the smallest or largest elements of `b`. This helps in efficiently selecting the elements that contribute the most to the total difference.

4. **Heap Population**: For each element in `a`, the program calculates the difference with the smallest and largest elements in `b` and pushes the larger difference (with a negative sign to simulate a max heap) along with the element and the index of the element in `b` that produced the larger difference.

5. **Heap Processing**: The program processes the heap, ensuring that the selected elements from `b` are not reused. If the index of the element in `b` that was used to calculate the difference is out of the current range (`tp1` to `tp2`), the program recalculates the difference using the current smallest or largest available element in `b`.

6. **Difference Calculation**: The program accumulates the differences to compute the total difference `ans` and prints it for each test case.

The logic and implementation seem to be sound and should handle the constraints and requirements of the problem correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
