The function `func` accepts no parameters directly, but based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function operates on multiple test cases, each containing two lists of integers, `a_i` and `b_i`, and two integers, `n` and `m`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with each test case having `n` integers in `a_i` and `m` integers in `b_i`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5`. The values in `a_i` and `b_i` are integers within the range `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9`. The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed `2 · 10^5`.

The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process multiple test cases, each with two lists of integers and their respective lengths, and return a result for each test case based on the processing of these lists.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i` with lengths `n` and `m` respectively, and returns a result for each test case.**
