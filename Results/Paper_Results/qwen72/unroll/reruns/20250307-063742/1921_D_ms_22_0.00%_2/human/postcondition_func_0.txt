The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i` with lengths `n` and `m` respectively. For each test case, it calculates the maximum sum of absolute differences between each element in `a_i` and the closest element in the sorted list `b_i`. The final state of the program, after processing all test cases, is that `t` is set to 0, and for each test case, the result (maximum sum of absolute differences) is printed to the console. If the function is not executed as the main module, the program does nothing, and the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` retain their initial values.
