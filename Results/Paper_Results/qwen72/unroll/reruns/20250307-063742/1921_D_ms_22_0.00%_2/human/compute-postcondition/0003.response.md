Output State: **t = 0, and for each test case, the variable `ans` contains the maximum sum of absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` after sorting `b` and processing the elements in `a`.**

### Explanation:
- **t = 0**: The loop runs until `t` is decremented to 0. This means that all test cases have been processed.
- **ans**: For each test case, the variable `ans` is calculated as the maximum sum of absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` after sorting `b`. The loop ensures that each element in `a` is paired with the element in `b` that maximizes the absolute difference, and this sum is accumulated in `ans`.

The loop processes each test case by:
1. Reading the values of `n` and `m`.
2. Reading the lists `a` and `b`.
3. Sorting the list `b`.
4. Using a max heap to store the absolute differences between elements in `a` and the smallest or largest elements in `b`.
5. Iteratively popping elements from the heap and updating the sum `ans` with the maximum possible absolute difference, while adjusting the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` to ensure the closest elements in `b` are considered.

After all iterations, `t` is 0, and the output for each test case is the value of `ans` printed.
