Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) between Petya's array \( a_i \) and Vasya's array \( c_i \), where \( c_i \) is constructed by selecting \( n \) elements from the sorted list \( b_i \).

### Key Points in the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \), followed by the arrays \( a_i \) and \( b_i \).

2. **Sorting \( b_i \):**
   - The array \( b_i \) is sorted to facilitate the selection of the most extreme values (smallest and largest) that will maximize the absolute differences.

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A max-heap is used to store the potential differences between each element in \( a_i \) and the smallest and largest elements in \( b_i \).
   - For each element \( a_i \), the program calculates the absolute differences with the smallest and largest elements in \( b_i \) and pushes the larger difference into the heap along with the index of the element in \( b_i \) that produced this difference.

4. **Heap Processing:**
   - The program then processes the heap to construct the array \( c_i \) that maximizes the total difference \( D \).
   - It checks if the element in \( b_i \) that was used to calculate the difference is still available (i.e., not already used in the construction of \( c_i \)).
   - If the element is not available, it recalculates the difference with the next available smallest or largest element in \( b_i \).
   - The total difference \( D \) is accumulated by adding the differences.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the maximum total difference \( D \).

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The program correctly identifies the potential maximum differences by considering the smallest and largest elements in \( b_i \) for each element in \( a_i \).
  - The use of a max-heap ensures that the largest differences are considered first, which is crucial for maximizing \( D \).
  - The program ensures that each element in \( b_i \) is used at most once by maintaining two pointers (`tp1` and `tp2`) that track the available smallest and largest elements.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where \( b_i \) contains all the same elements (e.g., the second test case where \( b_i = [1, 1, 1, 1] \)).
  - It also handles cases where \( b_i \) has more elements than \( a_i \) (e.g., the first test case where \( m > n \)).

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sorting of \( b_i \) takes \( O(m \log m) \) time.
  - The heap operations (push and pop) take \( O(\log n) \) time, and there are \( n \) such operations.
  - Overall, the time complexity is \( O(m \log m + n \log n) \), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference \( D \) for each test case. It handles the input and output as described in the problem statement and efficiently computes the result.
