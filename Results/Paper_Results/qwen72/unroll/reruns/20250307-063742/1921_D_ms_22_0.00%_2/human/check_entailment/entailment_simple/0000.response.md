### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.
   - The constraints are respected, and the inputs are handled as expected.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `b` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows us to efficiently find the maximum possible difference for each element in `a`.

3. **Heap Construction**:
   - The program constructs a max heap (using negative values to simulate a max heap with Python's `heapq` which is a min heap by default).
   - For each element `i` in `a`, it calculates the absolute differences with the smallest and largest elements in `b` (i.e., `b[0]` and `b[m-1]`).
   - It pushes the negative of the larger difference, along with the element `i` and the index of the chosen element in `b` (either `0` or `m-1`), into the heap.

4. **Heap Processing**:
   - The program processes the heap to maximize the total difference `D`.
   - It pops elements from the heap and checks if the chosen index in `b` is still within the valid range (`tp1` to `tp2`).
   - If the index is out of range, it recalculates the differences with the current smallest and largest valid elements in `b` and updates the total difference `ans`.
   - If the index is within the valid range, it adds the difference to `ans` and updates the range by incrementing `tp1` or decrementing `tp2` as appropriate.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum total difference `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- **Correctness**:
  - The algorithm ensures that for each element in `a`, it selects the element in `b` that maximizes the absolute difference.
  - By using a heap, it efficiently manages and processes the elements in `a` to find the optimal pairs with elements in `b`.
  - The use of `tp1` and `tp2` to track the valid range of indices in `b` ensures that the same element in `b` is not used more than once.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where `a` and `b` have the same elements, and where `b` has all identical elements.
  - It also handles the case where `n` is equal to `m`.

- **Complexity**:
  - The sorting step takes \(O(m \log m)\) time.
  - The heap operations (push and pop) take \(O(n \log n)\) time.
  - The overall complexity is \(O(t \cdot (m \log m + n \log n))\), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference `D` for each test case. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
