Postcondition: **If the program is executed as the main module, `t` is set to 0, and for each test case, the variable `ans` contains the maximum sum of absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` after sorting `b` and processing the elements in `a`. Otherwise, the program does nothing and `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` retain their initial values.**
