Postcondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and m are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The current execution context is the main module, meaning the code is running as the primary entry point and not as an imported module.**
