### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting `b`:**
   - The program sorts the list `b` to facilitate the selection of the maximum difference for each element in `a`.

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A max heap is used to store tuples of the form `(-difference, a_i, index)`, where `difference` is the absolute difference between `a_i` and the smallest or largest element in `b`.
   - The heap is used to prioritize the elements of `a` that have the largest potential differences with elements in `b`.

4. **Heap Population:**
   - For each element `i` in `a`, the program calculates the absolute differences with the smallest and largest elements in `b`.
   - It then pushes the tuple with the larger difference into the max heap.

5. **Heap Processing:**
   - The program processes the heap by popping the element with the largest difference.
   - If the index of the element in `b` (from the heap) is out of the current range `[tp1, tp2]`, it recalculates the differences with the current smallest and largest elements in `b` and updates the answer accordingly.
   - If the index is within the range, it directly adds the difference to the answer and adjusts the range by incrementing `tp1` or decrementing `tp2`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum sum of absolute differences for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The algorithm aims to maximize the sum of absolute differences by always choosing the largest possible difference for each element in `a`.
- By sorting `b` and using a max heap, the program ensures that it always considers the most significant differences first.
- The use of `tp1` and `tp2` to track the range of available elements in `b` helps in efficiently selecting the best possible element for each `a_i`.

### Potential Issues:
- The program correctly handles the edge case where all elements in `b` are the same (e.g., the second test case).
- The program ensures that the elements in `b` are used exactly once by adjusting `tp1` and `tp2`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum sum of absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b` for each test case. The use of a max heap and the sorting of `b` are appropriate for the problem, and the program handles the constraints and edge cases correctly.
