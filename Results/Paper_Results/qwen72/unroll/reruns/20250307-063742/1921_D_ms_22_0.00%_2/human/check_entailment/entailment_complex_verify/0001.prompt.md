You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

        #State: t = 0, and for each test case, the variable `ans` contains the maximum sum of absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` after sorting `b` and processing the elements in `a`.
    #State: If the program is executed as the main module, `t` is set to 0, and for each test case, the variable `ans` contains the maximum sum of absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` after sorting `b` and processing the elements in `a`. Otherwise, the program does nothing and `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` retain their initial values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i` with lengths `n` and `m` respectively. For each test case, it calculates the maximum sum of absolute differences between each element in `a_i` and the closest element in the sorted list `b_i`. The final state of the program, after processing all test cases, is that `t` is set to 0, and for each test case, the result (maximum sum of absolute differences) is printed to the console. If the function is not executed as the main module, the program does nothing, and the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` retain their initial values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given two arrays: `a` of length `n` and `b` of length `m` (where `m >= n`).
   - The goal is to select `n` elements from `b` and arrange them in a new array `c` such that the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) is maximized.

2. **Algorithm Overview:**
   - The program uses a max-heap to keep track of the maximum possible differences between elements of `a` and the smallest and largest elements of `b`.
   - It sorts the array `b` to facilitate the selection of the most extreme values (smallest and largest) that will maximize the differences.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - **Input Reading:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.
     - This part is correct and follows the problem's input format.

   - **Sorting `b`:**
     - The array `b` is sorted in ascending order.
     - This is necessary to easily access the smallest and largest elements of `b` for maximizing the differences.

   - **Heap Initialization:**
     - A max-heap is initialized to store tuples of the form `(-diff, a_i, index)`, where `diff` is the difference between `a_i` and the smallest or largest element in `b`.
     - The negative of `diff` is used to simulate a max-heap using Python's `heapq` which is a min-heap by default.

   - **Heap Population:**
     - For each element `i` in `a`, the program calculates the differences with the smallest (`b[0]`) and largest (`b[m-1]`) elements in `b`.
     - It pushes the tuple with the larger difference into the heap.
     - This ensures that the heap contains the most significant differences first.

   - **Heap Processing:**
     - The program processes the heap until it is empty.
     - For each item popped from the heap, it checks if the original difference was with the smallest or largest element in `b`.
     - If the original difference was with an element that has already been used (i.e., `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`), it recalculates the difference with the current smallest (`b[tp1]`) or largest (`b[tp2]`) available element.
     - It then updates the total difference `ans` and adjusts the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` to mark the used elements.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All elements in `b` are the same:**
     - If all elements in `b` are the same, the program will correctly calculate the difference as 0, which is the maximum possible difference in this case.
   - **`m` is exactly `n`:**
     - If `m` is exactly `n`, the program will select the smallest and largest elements from `b` to maximize the differences, which is correct.
   - **Multiple test cases:**
     - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop and resetting the heap for each test case.

5. **Complexity Analysis:**
   - **Time Complexity:**
     - Sorting `b` takes \( O(m \log m) \).
     - Each element of `a` is processed once, and each heap operation (push and pop) takes \( O(\log n) \).
     - The overall complexity is \( O(t \cdot (m \log m + n \log n)) \), which is efficient given the constraints.
   - **Space Complexity:**
     - The heap can contain up to `n` elements, so the space complexity is \( O(n) \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference \( D \) by selecting the most extreme elements from `b` and ensuring that each element in `a` is paired with the element in `b` that maximizes the difference. The program handles edge cases and multiple test cases appropriately.
