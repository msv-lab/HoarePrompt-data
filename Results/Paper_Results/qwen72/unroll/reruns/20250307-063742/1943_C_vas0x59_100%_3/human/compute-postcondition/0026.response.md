To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ops))` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the conditions under which the list `ops` is populated.

### Initial State:
- `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, in reverse order.
- `ops` is an empty list before the if-else block.
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
  - `ops` is a list containing tuples where the first element of each tuple is `c` and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive.
  - The length of `ops` is `ci + 1`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even:
  - `ops` is a list containing pairs of `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` with a step of 2.
  - The values of `path_ba`, `ci`, `ci1`, `ci2`, `c`, `c1`, and `c2` remain unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Length of `path_ba`:**
   - We need to know whether the length of `path_ba` is odd or even to determine how `ops` is populated.

2. **Populate `ops` Based on the Length of `path_ba`:**
   - If `len(path_ba)` is odd:
     - `ops` will contain `ci + 1` tuples of the form `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `ci` inclusive.
   - If `len(path_ba)` is even:
     - `ops` will contain pairs of `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` with a step of 2.
     - The number of pairs will be \(\left\lfloor \frac{\text{len(path_ba)} - \text{ci1} - 1}{2} \right\rfloor\).

3. **Calculate the Length of `ops`:**
   - If `len(path_ba)` is odd, the length of `ops` is `ci + 1`.
   - If `len(path_ba)` is even, the length of `ops` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{\text{len(path_ba)} - \text{ci1} - 1}{2} \right\rfloor\).

### Final Output:
- **If `len(path_ba)` is odd:**
  - The length of `ops` is `ci + 1`.
  - Output: **ci + 1 (where ci is the value of ci)**
- **If `len(path_ba)` is even:**
  - The length of `ops` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{\text{len(path_ba)} - \text{ci1} - 1}{2} \right\rfloor\).
  - Output: **\(\left\lfloor \frac{\text{len(path_ba)} - \text{ci1} - 1}{2} \right\rfloor\) (where len(path_ba) is the length of path_ba and ci1 is the value of ci1)**

Since the exact values of `path_ba`, `ci`, and `ci1` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **ci + 1 (if the length of path_ba is odd) or \(\left\lfloor \frac{\text{len(path_ba)} - \text{ci1} - 1}{2} \right\rfloor\) (if the length of path_ba is even)**
