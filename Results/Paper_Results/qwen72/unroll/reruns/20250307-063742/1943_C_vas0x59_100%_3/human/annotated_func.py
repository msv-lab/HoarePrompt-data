#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads input values directly from the standard input. It assumes that the input is correctly formatted according to the problem description, with the first line containing a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3) representing the number of vertices in the tree, followed by `n - 1` lines, each containing two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing the edges of the tree.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a tree structure from the standard input, where the first line contains the number of vertices `n`, and the subsequent `n - 1` lines describe the edges of the tree. It then computes the shortest path between two vertices `a` and `b` in the tree. Based on the length of this path, it constructs a list `ops` of operations. If the path length is odd, `ops` contains tuples where the first element is the middle vertex `c` and the second element ranges from 0 to the middle index. If the path length is even, `ops` contains alternating tuples of two middle vertices `c1` and `c2` with the second element ranging from 1 to the length of the path minus the middle index, in steps of 2. The function prints the length of `ops` and the contents of `ops` in a specific format, and returns `None`. The tree structure and the path information remain unchanged.
