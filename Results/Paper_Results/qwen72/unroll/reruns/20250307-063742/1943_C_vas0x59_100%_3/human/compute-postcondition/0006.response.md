Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices of the vertices that are connected to the corresponding vertex in the tree. `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs(a)` function. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is the array of previous vertices returned by the `bfs(a)` function.**

Explanation:
- The variable `u2vs` remains unchanged.
- The variable `d` is updated to the distance array returned by the `bfs(a)` function.
- The variable `a` remains the same, as it was previously the result of `func_1(d)`.
- The variable `previous` is introduced and assigned the array of previous vertices returned by the `bfs(a)` function.
