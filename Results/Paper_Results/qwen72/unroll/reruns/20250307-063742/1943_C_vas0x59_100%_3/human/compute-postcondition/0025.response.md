Postcondition: ***`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, in reverse order. `ops` is an empty list before the if-else block. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing tuples where the first element of each tuple is `c` and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive, and the length of `ops` is `ci + 1`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing pairs of `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` with a step of 2. The values of `path_ba`, `ci`, `ci1`, `ci2`, `c`, `c1`, and `c2` remain unchanged.***
