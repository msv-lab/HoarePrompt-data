Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, in reverse order. `ops` is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is an odd number. `ci` is the integer part of half the length of `path_ba`. `c` is the element at the index `ci` in `path_ba`.** 

In natural language: The variable `c` is now assigned the value of the element at the index `ci` in the list `path_ba`. The list `path_ba` still contains the indices of the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, in reverse order. The list `ops` remains empty, and the length of `path_ba` is still an odd number. The value of `ci` is still the integer part of half the length of `path_ba`.
