The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads input values directly from the standard input. The input consists of:
- A single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3) representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- Followed by `n - 1` lines, each containing two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing the edges of the tree.

The function modifies a list named `ops` based on the length of `path_ba`, but it does not return any value. The values of `path_ba`, `ci`, `ci1`, `ci2`, `c`, `c1`, and `c2` remain unchanged.

Functionality: **The function reads a tree structure from the standard input and modifies a list `ops` based on the length of a path in the tree, but it does not return any value.**
