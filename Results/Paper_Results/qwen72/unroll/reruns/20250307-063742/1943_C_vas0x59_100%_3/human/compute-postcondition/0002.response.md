The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute `n - 1` times, so `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted, as it is not used in the loop head.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, inclusive, and `n` must be greater than 1**
