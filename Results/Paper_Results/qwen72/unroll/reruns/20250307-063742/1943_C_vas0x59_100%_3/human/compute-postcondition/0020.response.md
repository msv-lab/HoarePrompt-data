Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, in reverse order. `ops` is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is even. `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`. `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`.** 

In natural language: The list `path_ba` still contains the indices of the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, in reverse order. The list `ops` remains empty. The length of `path_ba` is still even, and `ci2` is still half the length of `path_ba`. The new variable `ci1` is now set to `ci2 - 1`.
