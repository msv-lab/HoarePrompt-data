To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to understand the structure of the `ops` list based on the initial state and the conditions provided.

### Initial State:
- `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, in reverse order.
- `ops` is an empty list before the if-else block.
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
  - `ops` is a list containing tuples where the first element of each tuple is `c` and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive.
  - The length of `ops` is `ci + 1`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even:
  - `ops` is a list containing pairs of `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` with a step of 2.
- The values of `path_ba`, `ci`, `ci1`, `ci2`, `c`, `c1`, and `c2` remain unchanged.

### Analysis:
1. **If the length of `path_ba` is odd:**
   - `ops` will be a list of tuples where each tuple is `(c, i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive.
   - The length of `ops` will be `ci + 1`.
   - The `print` statement will map each tuple `(c, i)` to a string `f'{c + 1} {i}'` and print each string on a new line.

2. **If the length of `path_ba` is even:**
   - `ops` will be a list of pairs of tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` with a step of 2.
   - The `print` statement will map each tuple `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` to a string `f'{c1 + 1} {i}'` and `f'{c2 + 1} {i}'` respectively, and print each string on a new line.

### Output Calculation:
- **Odd Length of `path_ba`:**
  - Each tuple in `ops` is `(c, i)`.
  - The output will be a series of lines where each line is `f'{c + 1} {i}'` for `i` from 0 to `ci`.

- **Even Length of `path_ba`:**
  - Each pair of tuples in `ops` is `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`.
  - The output will be a series of lines where each line is `f'{c1 + 1} {i}'` and `f'{c2 + 1} {i}'` for `i` from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` with a step of 2.

### Final Output:
- **If the length of `path_ba` is odd:**
  - Output: **[c + 1] 0\n[c + 1] 1\n... [c + 1] ci (where each line is `f'{c + 1} {i}'` for `i` from 0 to `ci` inclusive)**

- **If the length of `path_ba` is even:**
  - Output: **[c1 + 1] 1\n[c2 + 1] 1\n[c1 + 1] 3\n[c2 + 1] 3\n... [c1 + 1] (len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1)\n[c2 + 1] (len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1) (where each line is `f'{c1 + 1} {i}'` and `f'{c2 + 1} {i}'` for `i` from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` with a step of 2)**

### Example:
- **Odd Length Example:**
  - Suppose `path_ba = [5, 3, 1]` (length is 3, which is odd).
  - `ci = 2`.
  - `ops` will be `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 2)]`.
  - Output: **[c + 1] 0\n[c + 1] 1\n[c + 1] 2**

- **Even Length Example:**
  - Suppose `path_ba = [6, 4, 2, 0]` (length is 4, which is even).
  - `ci1 = 1`.
  - `ops` will be `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3)]`.
  - Output: **[c1 + 1] 1\n[c2 + 1] 1\n[c1 + 1] 3\n[c2 + 1] 3**

### Final Answer:
Output: **[c + 1] 0\n[c + 1] 1\n... [c + 1] ci (if the length of `path_ba` is odd) or [c1 + 1] 1\n[c2 + 1] 1\n[c1 + 1] 3\n[c2 + 1] 3\n... [c1 + 1] (len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1)\n[c2 + 1] (len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1) (if the length of `path_ba` is even)**
