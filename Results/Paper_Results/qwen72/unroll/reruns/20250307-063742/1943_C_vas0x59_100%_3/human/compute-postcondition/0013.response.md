The value of `ci` is assigned the result of `len(path_ba) // 2`. Since the length of `path_ba` is an odd number, `ci` will be the integer part of half the length of `path_ba`. For example, if `path_ba` has a length of 5, then `ci` will be 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, in reverse order. `ops` is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is an odd number. `ci` is the integer part of half the length of `path_ba`.**
