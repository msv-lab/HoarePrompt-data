Output State: `path_ba` remains a list containing the indices of the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, in reverse order. `ops` is a list containing tuples where each tuple is `(c, i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive. `ci` remains the integer part of half the length of `path_ba`. `c` remains the element at the index `ci` in `path_ba`.
