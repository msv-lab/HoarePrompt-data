Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices of the vertices that are connected to the corresponding vertex in the tree. `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs(a)` function. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is the array of previous vertices returned by the `bfs(a)` function. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
