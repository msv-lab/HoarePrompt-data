Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, in reverse order. `ops` is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is even. `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`. `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`. `c1` is the element at index `ci1` of `path_ba`. `c2` is the element at index `ci2` of `path_ba`.** 

In natural language: The initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the variable `c2`, which is now assigned the value of the element at index `ci2` in the list `path_ba`.
