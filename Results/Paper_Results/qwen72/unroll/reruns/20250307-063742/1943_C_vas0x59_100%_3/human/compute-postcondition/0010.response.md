Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, in reverse order.**

Explanation: The loop continues to append the previous vertex in the shortest path from `b` to `a` to the list `path_ba` until it reaches the starting vertex `a` (or a vertex with no previous vertex, indicated by `-1`). As a result, `path_ba` will contain the vertices in the shortest path from `b` to `a`, but in reverse order (from `b` to `a`). The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
