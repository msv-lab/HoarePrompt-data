No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads input values directly from the standard input. It assumes that the input is correctly formatted according to the problem description, with the first line containing a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3) representing the number of vertices in the tree, followed by `n - 1` lines, each containing two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing the edges of the tree.
