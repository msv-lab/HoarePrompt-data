You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads input values directly from the standard input. It assumes that the input is correctly formatted according to the problem description, with the first line containing a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3) representing the number of vertices in the tree, followed by `n - 1` lines, each containing two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing the edges of the tree.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)

        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `ops` is a list containing tuples where the first element of each tuple is `c` and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive. The length of `ops` is `ci + 1`. The values of `path_ba`, `ci`, and `c` remain unchanged.

        #State: `ops` is a list containing pairs of `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` with a step of 2. `path_ba`, `ci1`, `ci2`, `c1`, and `c2` remain unchanged.
    #State: *`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, in reverse order. `ops` is an empty list before the if-else block. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing tuples where the first element of each tuple is `c` and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive, and the length of `ops` is `ci + 1`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing pairs of `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` with a step of 2. The values of `path_ba`, `ci`, `ci1`, `ci2`, `c`, `c1`, and `c2` remain unchanged.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: ci + 1 (if the length of path_ba is odd) or \(\left\lfloor \frac{\text{len(path_ba)} - \text{ci1} - 1}{2} \right\rfloor\) (if the length of path_ba is even)

    return None
    #The program returns None. The `ops` list is modified based on the length of `path_ba` but the specific content of `ops` is not returned. The values of `path_ba`, `ci`, `ci1`, `ci2`, `c`, `c1`, and `c2` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads a tree structure from the standard input and modifies a list `ops` based on the length of a path in the tree, but it does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None. The `ops` list is modified based on the length of `path_ba` but the specific content of `ops` is not returned. The values of `path_ba`, `ci`, `ci1`, `ci2`, `c`, `c1`, and `c2` remain unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
