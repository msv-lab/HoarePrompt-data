Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices of the vertices that are connected to the corresponding vertex in the tree. `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs(a)` function. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is the array of previous vertices returned by the `bfs(a)` function. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`.**
