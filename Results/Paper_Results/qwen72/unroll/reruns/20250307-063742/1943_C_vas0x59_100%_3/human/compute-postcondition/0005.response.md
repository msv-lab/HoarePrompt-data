The code snippet `a = func_1(d)` assigns the result of the function `func_1` called with the distance array `d` to the variable `a`. The specific value of `a` depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the values in `d`. The other variables and the structure of `u2vs` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices of the vertices that are connected to the corresponding vertex in the tree. `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs(0)` function. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.**
