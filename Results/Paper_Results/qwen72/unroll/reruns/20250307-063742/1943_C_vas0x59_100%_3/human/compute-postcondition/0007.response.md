Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices of the vertices that are connected to the corresponding vertex in the tree. `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs(a)` function. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is the array of previous vertices returned by the `bfs(a)` function. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.** 

The code snippet `b = func_1(d)` assigns the result of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, and `previous`) remain unchanged. The value of `b` is now the same as the value of `a`, since both are the result of `func_1(d)`.
