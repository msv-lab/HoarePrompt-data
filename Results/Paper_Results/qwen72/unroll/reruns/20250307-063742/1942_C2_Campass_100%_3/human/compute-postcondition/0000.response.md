The code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that maps the input from `input().split()` to integers. This lambda function `R` is now available for use in the program, but it does not change the values of any existing variables or execute any immediate operations. The initial state conditions for `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of chosen vertices remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function `func` is incomplete and lacks parameters. The parameters should satisfy the conditions: `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, `0 <= y <= n - x`, and the list of chosen vertices should contain distinct integers from 1 to n. `R` is a lambda function that maps input to integers.**
