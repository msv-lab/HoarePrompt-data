Output State: **The function `func` is incomplete and lacks parameters. The parameters should satisfy the conditions: `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, `0 <= y <= n - x`, and the list of chosen vertices should contain distinct integers from 1 to n. `R` is a lambda function that maps input to integers. `t` is an integer obtained from the input.**
