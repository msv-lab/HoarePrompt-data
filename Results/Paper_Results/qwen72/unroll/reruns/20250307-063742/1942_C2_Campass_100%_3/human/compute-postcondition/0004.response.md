The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The parameters should satisfy the conditions: `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, `0 <= y <= n - x`, and the list of chosen vertices should contain distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the problem description.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It returns a value based on these inputs, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified.**
