The function `func` is incomplete and lacks parameters. Based on the problem description, the function should accept parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The parameters should satisfy the conditions: `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, `0 <= y <= n - x`, and the list of chosen vertices should contain distinct integers from 1 to n.
