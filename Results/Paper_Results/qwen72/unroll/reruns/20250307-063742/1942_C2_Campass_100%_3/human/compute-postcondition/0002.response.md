To determine if the `while` loop can execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is truthy (i.e., non-zero for integers).

Given the program state right before the loop:
- The function `func` is incomplete and lacks parameters.
- The parameters should satisfy the conditions: `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, `0 <= y <= n - x`, and the list of chosen vertices should contain distinct integers from 1 to n.
- `R` is a lambda function that maps input to integers.
- `t` is an integer obtained from the input.

The only variable in the loop head is `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be non-zero. Since `t` is an integer obtained from the input, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer.

State: **`func` is incomplete and lacks parameters, `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, `0 <= y <= n - x`, the list of chosen vertices should contain distinct integers from 1 to n, `R` is a lambda function that maps input to integers, `t` must be a positive integer**
