The function `func` reads input values and processes them to calculate and print a series of integers. Each integer represents the value of `cons` for a given set of parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. The function does not return any value. After processing all input sets, the function will have printed `t` integers, where `t` is the number of test cases provided in the initial input. The final state of the program includes `t` being reduced to 0, and the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `l`, `val`, and `sx` being the last computed values for the final test case.
