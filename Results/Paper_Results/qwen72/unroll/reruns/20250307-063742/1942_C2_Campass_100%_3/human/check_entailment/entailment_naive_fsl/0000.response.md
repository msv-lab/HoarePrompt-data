Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the vertices chosen by Bessie are not consecutive and the additional vertices chosen by the user can form more triangles. Specifically, the program's logic for calculating the number of additional vertices that can be used to form triangles is flawed.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
8 4 2
1 3 6 8
```
In this case, Bessie has chosen vertices 1, 3, 6, and 8. The program will calculate the gaps between these vertices as follows:
- Gap between 1 and 3: 1
- Gap between 3 and 6: 2
- Gap between 6 and 8: 1
- Gap between 8 and 1 (considering the polygon is cyclic): 2

The program will then sort these gaps and try to use the additional vertices to maximize the number of triangles. However, the logic for distributing the additional vertices (y) is incorrect. The program should consider the cyclic nature of the polygon and the possibility of forming more triangles by placing the additional vertices in the gaps.

A correct approach would involve a more sophisticated method to distribute the additional vertices (y) in the gaps to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles. The current logic does not ensure that the additional vertices are used optimally to form the maximum number of triangles.
