### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is not ideal for clarity, but it works because the function reads input directly using `input()`.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case in a loop.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the function reads `n`, `x`, and `y`, which represent the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose, respectively.
   - It reads the list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, sorts them, and appends the first vertex plus `n` to the end of the list to handle the circular nature of the polygon.

3. **Calculating Gaps:**
   - The function calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and stores them in the list `val`.
   - These gaps represent the number of vertices between the chosen vertices that can be used to form diagonals.

4. **Sorting Gaps:**
   - The gaps are sorted based on a custom key: `(1 - x & 1, x)`. This key ensures that gaps are first sorted by their parity (odd gaps come before even gaps) and then by their size.
   - This sorting helps in maximizing the number of triangles by preferentially using the larger gaps first.

5. **Maximizing Triangles:**
   - The function iterates over the sorted gaps and tries to use as many additional vertices as possible to form triangles.
   - For each gap, it calculates the number of additional vertices that can be used (`c = i // 2`), and if `y` (the remaining vertices you can choose) is less than `c`, it uses all of `y` to form triangles.
   - Otherwise, it uses `c` vertices to form triangles and reduces `y` by `c`.

6. **Calculating the Final Result:**
   - The function calculates the total number of triangles that can be formed (`cons = x + sx - 2`), where `x` is the number of vertices Bessie chose, and `sx` is the total number of additional vertices used to form triangles.
   - This formula is derived from the fact that each triangle is formed by 3 vertices, and the total number of triangles is the total number of vertices minus 2.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The logic for calculating the gaps and sorting them is appropriate for the problem.
- The method of using the gaps to maximize the number of triangles is logically sound.
- The final calculation of the number of triangles is consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The function appears to correctly solve the problem based on the provided problem description and the execution states of the program.
