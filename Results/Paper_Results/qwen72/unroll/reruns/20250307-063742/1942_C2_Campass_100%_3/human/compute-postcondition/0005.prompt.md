You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and lacks parameters. Based on the problem description, the function should accept parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The parameters should satisfy the conditions: `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, `0 <= y <= n - x`, and the list of chosen vertices should contain distinct integers from 1 to n.
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, x, y = R()
        
        sx = 0
        
        l = list(R())
        
        l.sort()
        
        l.append(n + l[0])
        
        val = []
        
        for i in range(1, x + 1):
            c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
            val.append(c)
        
        val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
        
        for i in val:
            c = i // 2
            if y < c:
                sx += y * 2
                break
            sx += i
            y -= c
        
        cons = x + sx - 2
        
        print(cons)
        
    #State: The loop will print a series of integers, each representing the value of `cons` for each iteration of the loop. The value of `t` will be 0 after all iterations. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `l`, `val`, and `sx` will be different for each iteration, but their final values will depend on the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It returns a value based on these inputs, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
