### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` uses binary search to find the maximum number `x` such that removing `k` edges from the tree results in each remaining connected component having at least `x` vertices.
   - The search range is from `1` to `n // k`, which is a reasonable upper bound because if we remove `k` edges, the tree will be split into `k + 1` components, and the minimum size of each component must be at least `n // (k + 1)`, which is approximately `n // k`.

2. **Tree Representation**:
   - The tree is represented using an adjacency list `g`, which is correctly constructed from the input edges.

3. **Subtree Size Calculation in `check`**:
   - The function `check` is used to verify if a given `A` (midpoint in binary search) can be the minimum size of each connected component after removing `k` edges.
   - It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to calculate the size of each subtree and count how many subtrees have a size of at least `A`.
   - The function correctly handles the root node and ensures that the count of valid subtrees is either greater than `k` or exactly `k` if the root's subtree size is also at least `A`.

4. **Edge Removal and Component Size**:
   - The binary search in `func_1` ensures that the value `x` is the maximum possible value that satisfies the condition.
   - The `check` function ensures that the tree can be split into `k + 1` components, each of size at least `x`.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the maximum `x` by using binary search and a DFS-based validation function.
   - The binary search ensures that the solution is efficient, and the DFS ensures that the subtree sizes are calculated accurately.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. The binary search and DFS approach together ensure that the maximum number `x` is found such that removing `k` edges results in each remaining connected component having at least `x` vertices.

**Correctness: **True****
