The function `check` accepts a positive integer `A` and operates on a tree represented by an adjacency list `g` with `n` vertices. It returns `True` if the number of nodes (excluding the root) whose subtree size is greater than or equal to `A` is greater than `k`, or if the root node's subtree size is greater than or equal to `A` and the number of such nodes is exactly `k`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. After the function concludes, the `stack` is empty, `visited` contains only the root node (1), `d` contains the count of nodes in each subtree rooted at each node (except for the root node which is not deleted), and `r` is the count of nodes (excluding the root) whose subtree size is greater than or equal to `A`.
