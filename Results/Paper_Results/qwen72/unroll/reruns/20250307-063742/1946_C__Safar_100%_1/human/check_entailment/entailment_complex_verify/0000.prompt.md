You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

- Annotated Code:

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and edges is a list of tuples (a, b) where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, representing the edges of the tree.

    #State: `g` is a list of lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i` in the tree. The lengths of the lists in `g` will vary depending on the degree of each node in the tree. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

    print(r)
    #This is printed: n // k - 1 (where n and k are the values of n and k, and n // k is the integer division of n by k)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of nodes in a tree), `k` (a specific node), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree). It constructs an adjacency list `g` to represent the tree. The function then performs a binary search to determine a specific value, which is printed as `n // k - 1`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the adjacency list `g` is populated with the tree's edges, and the value `n // k - 1` is printed. The original parameters `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of a tree with n vertices, and k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n.

    return False
    #The program returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `check` accepts a positive integer `A` and operates on a tree represented by an adjacency list `g` with `n` vertices. It returns `True` if the number of nodes (excluding the root) whose subtree size is greater than or equal to `A` is greater than `k`, or if the root node's subtree size is greater than or equal to `A` and the number of such nodes is exactly `k`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. After the function concludes, the `stack` is empty, `visited` contains only the root node (1), `d` contains the count of nodes in each subtree rooted at each node (except for the root node which is not deleted), and `r` is the count of nodes (excluding the root) whose subtree size is greater than or equal to `A`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle the input and output as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to print the result for each set of input data, but the function `check` is not defined to take the graph `g` as an argument, which is necessary for it to work correctly. Additionally, the program does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem description. The function `func_1` should be called for each test case, and the graph `g` should be rebuilt for each test case. Here is a potential case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
2
5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
3 1
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will likely fail or produce incorrect results because the graph `g` is not reset between test cases, and the `check` function does not have access to the graph `g`.

To fix this, the `check` function should take the graph `g` as an argument, and the graph should be rebuilt for each test case.
