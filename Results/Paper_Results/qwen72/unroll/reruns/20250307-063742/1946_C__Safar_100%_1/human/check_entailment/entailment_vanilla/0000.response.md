### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given a tree with `n` vertices and need to remove `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible value of `x`.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `check`.
   - `func_1` is the main function that processes the input and uses binary search to find the maximum `x`.
   - `check` is a helper function that verifies if a given `x` can be achieved by removing `k` edges.

3. **Binary Search in `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes a graph `g` using adjacency lists.
   - It sets the initial range for binary search: `l = 1` and `r = n // k`.
   - The binary search iterates while `l <= r`, calculating the midpoint `mid` and checking if it is possible to achieve a component size of at least `mid` using the `check` function.
   - If `check(mid)` returns `True`, it means `mid` is a valid component size, so we try a larger value by setting `l = mid + 1`.
   - If `check(mid)` returns `False`, it means `mid` is not a valid component size, so we try a smaller value by setting `r = mid - 1`.
   - The function prints `r` after the binary search completes, which should be the maximum valid `x`.

4. **Helper Function `check`:**
   - The function uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree.
   - It maintains a stack to keep track of the current node and its parent.
   - It uses a dictionary `d` to store the size of each component.
   - The function iterates through the stack, marking nodes as visited and calculating the size of each component.
   - If a node's size is at least `A`, it increments the count `r`.
   - If a node's size is less than `A`, it adds its size to its parent's size.
   - The function returns `True` if the number of valid components `r` is greater than `k` or if the root component is valid and `r` equals `k`.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The `check` function does not correctly handle the case where the root component is valid but `r` is less than `k`.
   - The `check` function should ensure that the total number of valid components is exactly `k` or more, but it currently only checks if `r` is greater than `k` or if the root component is valid and `r` equals `k`.
   - The `check` function should also handle the case where the root component is valid and `r` is exactly `k`.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The binary search in `func_1` is correctly implemented.
   - The `check` function needs to be adjusted to correctly count the number of valid components and handle the root component properly.

### Conclusion:
The program is **not** correct because the `check` function does not correctly handle the case where the root component is valid but the total number of valid components is less than `k`. This can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Correctness: **False**
