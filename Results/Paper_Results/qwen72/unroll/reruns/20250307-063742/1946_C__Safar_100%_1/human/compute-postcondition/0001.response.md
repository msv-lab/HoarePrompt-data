Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of a tree with n vertices, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, stack is a list containing the tuple (1, 1), visited is an empty set.**

The initial state variables `A`, `g`, `k`, and `stack` remain unchanged. The new variable `visited` is initialized as an empty set.
