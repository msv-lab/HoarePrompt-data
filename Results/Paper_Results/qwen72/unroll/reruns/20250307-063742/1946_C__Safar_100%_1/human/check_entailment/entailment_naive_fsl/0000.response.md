Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle the input and output as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to print the result for each set of input data, but the function `check` is not defined to take the graph `g` as an argument, which is necessary for it to work correctly. Additionally, the program does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem description. The function `func_1` should be called for each test case, and the graph `g` should be rebuilt for each test case. Here is a potential case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
2
5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
3 1
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will likely fail or produce incorrect results because the graph `g` is not reset between test cases, and the `check` function does not have access to the graph `g`.

To fix this, the `check` function should take the graph `g` as an argument, and the graph should be rebuilt for each test case.
