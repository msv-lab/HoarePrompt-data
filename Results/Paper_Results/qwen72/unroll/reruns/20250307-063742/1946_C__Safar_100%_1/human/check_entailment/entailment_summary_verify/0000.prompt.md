You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)
    c = 0

    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    print(r)

#Function 2:
def check(A):
    stack = [(1, 1)]
    visited = set()
    d = {1: 1}
    r = 0
    while True:
        (x, p) = stack[-1]
        if x not in visited:
            visited.add(x)
            d[x] = 1
            for node in g[x]:
                if node != p:
                    stack.append((node, x))
        else:
            if x == 1:
                break
            if d[x] >= A:
                r += 1
            else:
                d[p] += d[x]
            stack.pop()
            visited.remove(x)
            del d[x]
    if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k):
        return True
    return False



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `check` accepts a positive integer `A` and operates on a tree represented by an adjacency list `g` with `n` vertices. It returns `True` if the number of nodes (excluding the root) whose subtree size is greater than or equal to `A` is greater than `k`, or if the root node's subtree size is greater than or equal to `A` and the number of such nodes is exactly `k`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. After the function concludes, the `stack` is empty, `visited` contains only the root node (1), `d` contains the count of nodes in each subtree rooted at each node (except for the root node which is not deleted), and `r` is the count of nodes (excluding the root) whose subtree size is greater than or equal to `A`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle the input and output as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to print the result for each set of input data, but the function `check` is not defined to take the graph `g` as an argument, which is necessary for it to work correctly. Additionally, the program does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem description. The function `func_1` should be called for each test case, and the graph `g` should be rebuilt for each test case. Here is a potential case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
2
5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
3 1
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will likely fail or produce incorrect results because the graph `g` is not reset between test cases, and the `check` function does not have access to the graph `g`.

To fix this, the `check` function should take the graph `g` as an argument, and the graph should be rebuilt for each test case.
