### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to handle a single test case. It constructs the graph `g` using the provided edges and then uses a binary search to find the maximum value `x` such that removing exactly `k` edges results in each remaining connected component having at least `x` vertices.
   - The function `check` is used within `func_1` to verify if a given `x` (denoted as `mid` in the binary search) can be achieved by removing `k` edges.

2. **Function `check` and Graph Access:**
   - The function `check` is supposed to determine if it is possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `A` vertices.
   - The function `check` currently does not take the graph `g` as an argument. This is a significant issue because `check` needs to traverse the graph to determine the sizes of the subtrees.
   - The function `check` uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree and count the sizes of the subtrees. It maintains a stack to simulate the DFS, a set `visited` to keep track of visited nodes, a dictionary `d` to store the sizes of the subtrees, and a variable `r` to count the number of subtrees with size at least `A`.

3. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The problem description specifies that the input consists of multiple test cases. The program should handle each test case independently, which means the graph `g` should be reset and rebuilt for each test case.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not account for multiple test cases. It only processes one test case and does not reset the graph `g` for subsequent test cases.

4. **Graph Reset and Function Call:**
   - To handle multiple test cases correctly, the graph `g` should be reset before processing each new test case. This can be done by reinitializing `g` with an empty list for each vertex.
   - The function `check` should be modified to take the graph `g` as an argument to ensure it has access to the current graph structure.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct. The program has several issues that prevent it from handling multiple test cases and correctly accessing the graph `g` within the `check` function. These issues are:

- **Graph `g` is not reset between test cases.**
- **Function `check` does not take the graph `g` as an argument.**

To fix these issues, the following changes are necessary:

1. **Reset the graph `g` for each test case:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       n, k = map(int, input().split())
       edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
       g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
       for (a, b) in edges:
           g[a].append(b)
           g[b].append(a)
       func_1(n, k, edges)
   ```

2. **Modify the `check` function to take the graph `g` as an argument:**
   ```python
   def check(A, g):
       stack = [(1, 1)]
       visited = set()
       d = {1: 1}
       r = 0
       while True:
           (x, p) = stack[-1]
           if x not in visited:
               visited.add(x)
               d[x] = 1
               for node in g[x]:
                   if node != p:
                       stack.append((node, x))
           else:
               if x == 1:
                   break
               if d[x] >= A:
                   r += 1
               else:
                   d[p] += d[x]
               stack.pop()
               visited.remove(x)
               del d[x]
       if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k):
           return True
       return False
   ```

3. **Update the call to `check` within `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(n, k, edges):
       g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
       for (a, b) in edges:
           g[a].append(b)
           g[b].append(a)
       l = 1
       r = n // k
       while l <= r:
           mid = l + (r - l) // 2
           if check(mid, g):
               l = mid + 1
           else:
               r = mid - 1
       print(r)
   ```

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the issues identified in the original assessment. The necessary changes to handle multiple test cases and ensure the `check` function has access to the graph `g` are required to make the program correct.
