Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Calls**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the inputs for each test case, which include `n` (number of vertices), `k` (number of edges to remove), and the edges of the tree.
   - It stores the inputs in a list `q` and then processes each test case by calling `func_1(n, k, edges)`.

2. **Tree Representation**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs an adjacency list `g` to represent the tree, which is a standard and correct way to represent a graph in Python.

3. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a binary search to determine the maximum number `x` such that removing exactly `k` edges results in each remaining connected component having at least `x` vertices.
   - The binary search is performed on the range `[1, n // k]`, which is a reasonable range for the maximum component size `x`.

4. **Subtree Size Calculation**:
   - The function `check(A)` is used to verify if a given `A` can be the minimum size of each connected component after removing `k` edges.
   - It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree and calculate the size of each subtree.
   - The `stack` is used to manage the DFS traversal, and the `visited` set ensures that each node is processed only once.
   - The dictionary `d` keeps track of the size of each subtree, and the variable `r` counts the number of subtrees whose size is at least `A`.

5. **Condition for Validity**:
   - The function `check(A)` returns `True` if the number of subtrees of size at least `A` is greater than `k` or if the root node's subtree size is at least `A` and the number of such subtrees is exactly `k`.
   - This condition ensures that the removal of `k` edges results in each component having at least `A` vertices.

6. **Output**:
   - The function `func_1` prints the result of the binary search, which is the value of `r` after the search. This value is the maximum `x` such that removing `k` edges results in each component having at least `x` vertices.

However, there is a critical issue in the implementation of `func_1` and `check`:

- **Binary Search Termination**:
  - The binary search in `func_1` should terminate with the correct value of `x` being `r` (the last valid value of `mid` that satisfies the condition in `check`).
  - The current implementation prints `r` as `n // k - 1`, which is incorrect. The correct value should be the last valid `mid` that satisfies the condition in `check`.

- **Correct Binary Search Logic**:
  - The binary search should update `c` to the last valid `mid` that satisfies the condition in `check`.
  - The final result should be printed as `c`, not `r`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of the binary search result.

Correctness: **False**
