### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The annotated code correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually. The function `func_1` is called for each test case, and the graph `g` is rebuilt for each test case. This is evident from the loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(int(input())):
         (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
         edges = []
         for _ in range(n - 1):
             (a, b) = map(int, input().split(' '))
             edges.append((a, b))
         func_1(n, k, edges)
     ```

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - The graph `g` is correctly constructed inside the `func_1` function using the provided edges. This is done by appending the connected nodes to each other's adjacency list:
     ```python
     g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
     for (a, b) in edges:
         g[a].append(b)
         g[b].append(a)
     ```

3. **Binary Search and `check` Function:**
   - The binary search in `func_1` is used to find the maximum value `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and ensure each remaining connected component has at least `x` nodes. The search range is from `1` to `n // k`, which is a reasonable range given the problem constraints.
   - The `check` function is called with the current midpoint `mid` of the binary search. The `check` function is supposed to determine if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `mid` nodes.
   - The `check` function uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree and count the sizes of the subtrees. It correctly updates the sizes of the subtrees and checks if the number of components with at least `mid` nodes is greater than or equal to `k`.

4. **State and Behavior of `check` Function:**
   - The `check` function maintains a stack to perform DFS, a set `visited` to keep track of visited nodes, a dictionary `d` to store the sizes of the subtrees, and a counter `r` to count the number of components with at least `mid` nodes.
   - The function correctly updates the sizes of the subtrees and checks if the root node's subtree size is at least `mid` and if the number of such components is exactly `k`.
   - The function returns `True` if the conditions are met and `False` otherwise.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The final output of `func_1` is `r`, which is the result of the binary search. This value is the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and ensure each remaining component has at least `x` nodes.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:

- **Graph `g` Reset:**
  - The original assessment correctly points out that the graph `g` should be rebuilt for each test case. However, the annotated code does rebuild the graph `g` for each test case inside the `func_1` function, so this is not an issue.

- **`check` Function Argument:**
  - The original assessment states that the `check` function does not take the graph `g` as an argument, which is incorrect. The `check` function does not need to take `g` as an argument because `g` is a global variable within the scope of both `func_1` and `check`. This is a valid approach in Python.

- **Test Case Handling:**
  - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program should handle multiple test cases. The annotated code does handle multiple test cases correctly by reading the number of test cases and processing each one individually.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program correctly handles multiple test cases, rebuilds the graph `g` for each test case, and the `check` function works as intended without needing to pass the graph `g` as an argument. The program's logic and implementation are correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

Final: **True**
