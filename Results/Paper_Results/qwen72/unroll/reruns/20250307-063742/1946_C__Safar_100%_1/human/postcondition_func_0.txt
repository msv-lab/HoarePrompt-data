The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of nodes in a tree), `k` (a specific node), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree). It constructs an adjacency list `g` to represent the tree. The function then performs a binary search to determine a specific value, which is printed as `n // k - 1`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the adjacency list `g` is populated with the tree's edges, and the value `n // k - 1` is printed. The original parameters `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
