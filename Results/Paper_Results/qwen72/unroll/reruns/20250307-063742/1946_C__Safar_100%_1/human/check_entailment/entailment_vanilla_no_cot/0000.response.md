Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Global Variable `g`**: The graph `g` is defined as a global variable inside `func_1`, but it is used in the `check` function without being passed as an argument. This can lead to issues if `check` is called in a different context where `g` is not defined.

2. **Binary Search Range**: The binary search range is defined as `l = 1` and `r = n // k`. However, the correct range should be `l = 1` and `r = n // (k + 1)`. This is because after removing `k` edges, the tree will be split into `k + 1` components, and the size of each component should be at least `x`.

3. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in `func_1` is incorrect. The `check` function should be called with the current `mid` value, and the result should be used to adjust the search range. However, the `check` function is called without passing the graph `g` and the current `mid` value.

4. **Check Function Logic**: The `check` function has a logical issue in how it handles the removal of edges and the calculation of the sizes of the remaining components. Specifically, the condition `if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k):` is not correct. It should be `if r == k + 1:` to ensure that the tree is split into exactly `k + 1` components, each of size at least `A`.

5. **Graph Representation**: The graph `g` is represented as an adjacency list, which is correct, but the `check` function should be able to handle the graph dynamically as edges are removed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)
    
    def check(A):
        stack = [(1, 0)]  # (node, parent)
        visited = set()
        d = {1: 0}
        r = 0
        
        while stack:
            (x, p) = stack[-1]
            if x not in visited:
                visited.add(x)
                d[x] = 1
                for node in g[x]:
                    if node != p:
                        stack.append((node, x))
            else:
                if d[x] >= A:
                    r += 1
                else:
                    d[p] += d[x]
                stack.pop()
                visited.remove(x)
                del d[x]
        
        return r == k + 1
    
    l = 1
    r = n // (k + 1)
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    print(r)

# Example usage:
t = 6
inputs = [
    (5, 1, [(1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)]),
    (2, 1, [(1, 2)]),
    (6, 1, [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)]),
    (3, 1, [(1, 2), (1, 3)]),
    (8, 2, [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)]),
    (6, 2, [(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)])
]

for _ in range(t):
    n, k, edges = inputs[_]
    func_1(n, k, edges)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and should correctly solve the problem.
