The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Since there are no parameters and no specific output described, the function could perform any operation that does not require input and does not necessarily return a value. However, based on the given information, we cannot determine the exact output or behavior of the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to perform an unspecified operation that does not require any input parameters.

Functionality: **The function performs an unspecified operation that does not require any input parameters.**
