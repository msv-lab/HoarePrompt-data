Output State: The loop has executed the `solve()` function a number of times equal to the integer value read from the standard input. The initial state of the variables is unchanged because no variables are used in the function signature or modified within the loop body. The only change is that the `solve()` function has been called multiple times, but the state of the variables outside the loop remains the same as the initial state.
