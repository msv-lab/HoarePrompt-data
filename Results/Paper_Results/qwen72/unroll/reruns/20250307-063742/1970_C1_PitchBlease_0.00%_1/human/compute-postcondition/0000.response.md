Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`. `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, where each entry `tree[node]` contains a list of integers representing the neighbors of `node`. `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple containing `start` and 0.**
