The only object in the loop head is `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `queue` is not empty. Right before the loop, `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple containing `start` and 0. Since `queue` contains at least one element, it is not empty, and the loop can execute the first time without any adjustments.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`. `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, where each entry `tree[node]` contains a list of integers representing the neighbors of `node`. `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple containing `start` and 0. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.**
