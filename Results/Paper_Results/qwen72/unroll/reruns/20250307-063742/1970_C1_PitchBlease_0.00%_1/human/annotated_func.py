#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, edges is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n and each tuple represents an edge in the tree, and start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n representing the starting node for the game.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node from 1 to n, and each value is a list containing all the nodes directly connected to the key node by an edge. The variables `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `edges` (a list of tuples representing edges in a tree), and `start` (an integer such that 1 <= start <= n representing the starting node). It constructs a tree from the edges, identifies the leaf nodes, and performs breadth-first searches (BFS) from the starting node to the first two leaf nodes. Based on the parity of the distances found, it returns 'Ron' if at least one of the distances is even, and 'Hermione' if both distances are odd. The input variables `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing node indices in the tree, such that 1 <= start, target <= n, and tree is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, where each entry tree[node] contains a list of integers representing the neighbors of node.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The `queue` is empty, `visited` contains all nodes that are reachable from `start` and have been visited, and the function returns the shortest distance `dist` from `start` to `target` if `target` is found. If `target` is not found, the loop will exhaust the `queue`, and the function will not return a value (or will return `None` if the function is expected to return a value in all cases).
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target was not found and the queue was exhausted.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `bfs` accepts two integers `start` and `target` representing node indices in a tree and returns the shortest distance (as an integer) from `start` to `target` if `target` is found. If `target` is not found after exhausting the search queue, the function returns -1. The function modifies a set `visited` to keep track of the nodes that have been visited during the search, but does not modify the input `tree`.
