The function `bfs` accepts two parameters: `start` and `target`. Both `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in a tree, with the constraint that 1 <= start, target <= n. The tree is represented as a dictionary or a list of lists, where each entry `tree[node]` contains a list of integers representing the neighbors of the node.

The function returns -1, indicating that the target node was not found and the queue used for the search was exhausted.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `start` and `target` representing node indices in a tree and returns -1 if the target node is not found after exhausting the search queue.**
