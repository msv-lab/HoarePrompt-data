Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `edges` (a list of tuples representing edges in a tree), and `start` (an integer such that 1 <= start <= n representing the starting node). It constructs a tree from the edges, identifies the leaf nodes, and performs breadth-first searches (BFS) from the starting node to the first two leaf nodes. Based on the parity of the distances found, it returns 'Ron' if at least one of the distances is even, and 'Hermione' if both distances are odd. The input variables `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged. **
