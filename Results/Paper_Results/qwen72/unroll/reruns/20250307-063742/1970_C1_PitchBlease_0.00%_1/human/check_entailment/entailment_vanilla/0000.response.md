### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Leaves Identification:**
   - The program first constructs the tree using a dictionary of lists (`defaultdict(list)`).
   - It then identifies the leaves of the tree by checking which nodes have only one neighbor. Since the tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves, this step is correct.

2. **BFS Function:**
   - The `bfs` function is used to find the shortest distance from the starting node to each of the leaves.
   - The function uses a queue to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) and a set to keep track of visited nodes.
   - When the target node is found, the function returns the distance. If the target node is not found (which should not happen in this problem since the tree is connected), it returns -1.

3. **Game Logic:**
   - The main function `func_1` calculates the distances from the starting node to both leaves using the `bfs` function.
   - The game is won by the player who can make the last move. Since the tree can be seen as an array with two leaves, the player who starts on a node with an even distance to one of the leaves will always be able to force the game to end on the other player's turn.
   - If either `dist1` or `dist2` is even, Ron wins the round because he can always move to a node that ensures the game ends on Hermione's turn.
   - If both `dist1` and `dist2` are odd, Hermione wins the round because Ron will always be forced to move to a node that ensures the game ends on his turn.

4. **Input and Output:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes it as described in the problem statement.
   - The output is a single line containing either "Ron" or "Hermione", which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem description accurately. It correctly identifies the leaves, calculates the distances, and determines the winner based on the parity of the distances.

Correctness: **True**
