You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing node indices in the tree, such that 1 <= start, target <= n, and tree is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, where each entry tree[node] contains a list of integers representing the neighbors of node.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The `queue` is empty, `visited` contains all nodes that are reachable from `start` and have been visited, and the function returns the shortest distance `dist` from `start` to `target` if `target` is found. If `target` is not found, the loop will exhaust the `queue`, and the function will not return a value (or will return `None` if the function is expected to return a value in all cases).
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target was not found and the queue was exhausted.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integers `start` and `target` representing node indices in a tree and returns -1 if the target node is not found after exhausting the search queue.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns -1, indicating that the target was not found and the queue was exhausted.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
