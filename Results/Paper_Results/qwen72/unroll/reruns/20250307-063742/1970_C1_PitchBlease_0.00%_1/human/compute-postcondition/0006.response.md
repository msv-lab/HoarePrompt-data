Functionality: ** The function `bfs` accepts two integers `start` and `target` representing node indices in a tree and returns the shortest distance (as an integer) from `start` to `target` if `target` is found. If `target` is not found after exhausting the search queue, the function returns -1. The function modifies a set `visited` to keep track of the nodes that have been visited during the search, but does not modify the input `tree`. **
