Output State: **The `queue` is empty, `visited` contains all nodes that are reachable from `start` and have been visited, and the function returns the shortest distance `dist` from `start` to `target` if `target` is found. If `target` is not found, the loop will exhaust the `queue`, and the function will not return a value (or will return `None` if the function is expected to return a value in all cases).**

In natural language, this means:
- The `queue` will be empty because the loop continues until there are no more nodes to process.
- The `visited` set will contain all the nodes that were visited during the search, starting from the `start` node and including all its reachable neighbors.
- If the `target` node is found, the function will return the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node, which is the number of edges traversed to reach `target`.
- If the `target` node is not found, the loop will finish, and the `queue` will be empty, but the function will not return a value (or will return `None` if the function is designed to do so).
