### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The tree is represented using an adjacency list (`tree`), where each node points to a list of its neighbors. This is a standard and efficient way to represent a graph in Python.

2. **Identifying Leaves**:
   - The program correctly identifies the leaves of the tree by checking which nodes have only one neighbor (`len(tree[node]) == 1`). Since the tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves, this step is valid.

3. **BFS Function**:
   - The `bfs` function is used to find the shortest path from the starting node to each of the two leaves. It uses a queue to explore the tree in a breadth-first manner, which is the correct approach for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
   - The function returns the distance to the target node if it is found. If the target node is not found, it returns `-1`. However, in this context, the target node (a leaf) is guaranteed to be reachable, so the function will always return a valid distance.

4. **Game Logic**:
   - The game logic is based on the parity of the distances from the starting node to the two leaves. If either distance is even, Ron wins because he can always move the stone to an even distance node, ensuring that Hermione will eventually be forced to move to a leaf node (which is a losing position).
   - If both distances are odd, Hermione wins because she will be the one to move the stone to a leaf node, which is a losing position for Ron.

5. **Input and Output**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes it as described in the problem statement.
   - The output is a single line containing either "Ron" or "Hermione", which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the given problem description and constraints. The BFS function is used appropriately to find the distances, and the game logic is correctly applied to determine the winner.
