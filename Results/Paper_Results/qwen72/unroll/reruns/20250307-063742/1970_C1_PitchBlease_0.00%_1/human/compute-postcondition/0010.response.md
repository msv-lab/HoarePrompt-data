The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `start`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the number of nodes in a tree. `edges` is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n, and each tuple represents an edge connecting two nodes in the tree. `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, representing the starting node for the game.

The function returns one of two strings based on the input:
- Case_1: The program returns the string 'Ron'.
- Case_2: The program returns the string 'Hermione'.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `edges`, and `start`, and returns 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on the game's rules applied to the tree structure defined by `n` and `edges`, starting from node `start`.**
