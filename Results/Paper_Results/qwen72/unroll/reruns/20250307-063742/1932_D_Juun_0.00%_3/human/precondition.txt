The function `solve` is expected to read input from stdin, where the input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds played, followed by a character representing the trump suit (one of "CDHS"), and a list of 2n unique two-character strings representing the cards in the discard pile. The function should output the possible sequence of rounds to stdout, or "IMPOSSIBLE" if no such sequence exists.
