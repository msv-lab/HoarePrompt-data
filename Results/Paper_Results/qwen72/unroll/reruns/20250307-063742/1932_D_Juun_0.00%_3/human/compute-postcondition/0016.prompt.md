You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: `n` (an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16), `trump_suit` (a character from "CDHS"), and `cards` (a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS"). The function should return a list of n pairs of cards, where each pair represents a valid round of the game, or "IMPOSSIBLE" if no such sequence can be reconstructed.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. `trump` is a string provided by the user. `trumps` is a list containing the ranks of all cards that have the suit equal to `trump`. `answers` is a list containing strings that represent the pairs of cards (in sorted order by rank) that had the same suit but were not the trump suit. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', and values set to `None` for any suit that had a pair of cards, or the rank of the last card of that suit if it did not form a pair.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged for keys with `None` values. For keys with non-`None` values, the corresponding ranks are paired with the highest remaining ranks from the `trumps` list, and these pairs are added to the `answers` list. The `trumps` list is emptied if it had enough ranks to pair with all non-`None` values in `suits`. If the `trumps` list runs out before all non-`None` values in `suits` are paired, the loop prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns, leaving the `trumps` list empty and the `answers` list with the pairs that were successfully formed.
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: The `trumps` list is empty, and the loop prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' if the `trumps` list runs out before all non-`None` values in `suits` are paired. The `answers` list contains the pairs that were successfully formed.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The `trumps` list remains empty, and the loop prints all the pairs that were successfully formed from the `answers` list. If the `trumps` list runs out before all non-`None` values in `suits` are paired, 'IMPOSSIBLE' is printed. The `answers` list contains the pairs that were successfully formed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), a trump suit character `trump_suit` from "CDHS", and a list of 2n unique two-character strings `cards` where each string represents a card with a rank from "23456789" and a suit from "CDHS". It returns a list of n pairs of cards, each pair representing a valid round of the game, or "IMPOSSIBLE" if no such sequence can be reconstructed.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
