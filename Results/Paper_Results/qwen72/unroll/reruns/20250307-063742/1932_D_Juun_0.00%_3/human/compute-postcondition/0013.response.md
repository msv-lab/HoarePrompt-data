Output State: The `trumps` list remains empty, and the loop prints all the pairs that were successfully formed from the `answers` list. If the `trumps` list runs out before all non-`None` values in `suits` are paired, 'IMPOSSIBLE' is printed. The `answers` list contains the pairs that were successfully formed.
