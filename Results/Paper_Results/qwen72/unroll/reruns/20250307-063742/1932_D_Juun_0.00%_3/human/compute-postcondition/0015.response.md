The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards`. 

- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16.
- `trump_suit` is a character from the set "CDHS".
- `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where each string consists of a rank from "23456789" and a suit from "CDHS".

The function returns a list of n pairs of cards, where each pair represents a valid round of the game. If no such sequence can be reconstructed, the function returns "IMPOSSIBLE".
