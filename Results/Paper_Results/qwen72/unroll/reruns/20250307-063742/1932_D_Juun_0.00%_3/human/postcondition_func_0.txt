The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads input from the user to determine the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit `trump_suit`, and a list of 2n unique card strings. It processes these cards to form `n` pairs of cards, where each pair represents a valid round of the game. The function prints the pairs of cards in a specific format: cards of the same suit (excluding the trump suit) are paired and sorted by rank, and any remaining cards are paired with the highest remaining trump cards. If it is not possible to form the required pairs, the function prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` are not modified.
