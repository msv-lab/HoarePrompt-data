Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `trumps` list is sorted in ascending order, and the `suits` dictionary remains unchanged for keys with `None` values. For keys with non-`None` values, the corresponding ranks are paired with the highest remaining ranks from the `trumps` list, and these pairs are added to the `answers` list. The `trumps` list is emptied if it had enough ranks to pair with all non-`None` values in `suits`. If the `trumps` list runs out before all non-`None` values in `suits` are paired, the loop prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns, leaving the `trumps` list empty and the `answers` list with the pairs that were successfully formed.
Code of the loop:
while trumps != []:
    print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
