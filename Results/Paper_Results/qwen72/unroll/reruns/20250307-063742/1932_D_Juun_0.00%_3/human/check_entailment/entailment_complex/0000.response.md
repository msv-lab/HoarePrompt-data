### Reasoning:

1. **Function Parameters and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is called in a loop for each test case, but it does not take any parameters. Instead, it reads input directly from the user.
   - The function should ideally take three parameters: `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` to make it more modular and testable. However, the current implementation reads these values from the input stream.

2. **Trump Card Handling:**
   - The function correctly identifies trump cards and stores their ranks in the `trumps` list.
   - Non-trump cards are stored in the `suits` dictionary, with the suit as the key and the rank as the value.

3. **Pairing Cards:**
   - The function attempts to pair non-trump cards of the same suit and adds these pairs to the `answers` list.
   - If a non-trump card cannot be paired with another card of the same suit, it is stored in the `suits` dictionary for later pairing with a trump card.

4. **Handling Remaining Cards:**
   - After processing all non-trump cards, the function attempts to pair any remaining non-trump cards with the highest available trump cards.
   - If there are not enough trump cards to pair with all remaining non-trump cards, the function prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the pairs of cards that represent valid rounds of the game.
   - If the `trumps` list is not empty after pairing all non-trump cards, it prints pairs of trump cards.
   - Finally, it prints all pairs stored in the `answers` list.

### Issues:
- **Input Handling:**
  - The function should take parameters instead of reading from the input stream directly. This makes it harder to test and less modular.
  - The function does not handle the number of test cases `t` correctly. It should be handled outside the function, and the function should be called for each test case.

- **Trump Card Pairing:**
  - The function does not correctly handle the case where there are more trump cards than non-trump cards. It should ensure that all trump cards are paired with each other if possible.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function does not handle the case where there are no non-trump cards and only trump cards. It should print pairs of trump cards directly in this case.

### Correctness:
- **False**: The function has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Specifically, it does not handle the number of test cases correctly, it does not take parameters, and it does not handle all edge cases properly.

### Correctness: **False**
