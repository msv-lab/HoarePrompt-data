#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: `n` (an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16), `trump_suit` (a character from "CDHS"), and `cards` (a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS"). The function should return a list of n pairs of cards, where each pair represents a valid round of the game, or "IMPOSSIBLE" if no such sequence can be reconstructed.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. `trump` is a string provided by the user. `trumps` is a list containing the ranks of all cards that have the suit equal to `trump`. `answers` is a list containing strings that represent the pairs of cards (in sorted order by rank) that had the same suit but were not the trump suit. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', and values set to `None` for any suit that had a pair of cards, or the rank of the last card of that suit if it did not form a pair.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged for keys with `None` values. For keys with non-`None` values, the corresponding ranks are paired with the highest remaining ranks from the `trumps` list, and these pairs are added to the `answers` list. The `trumps` list is emptied if it had enough ranks to pair with all non-`None` values in `suits`. If the `trumps` list runs out before all non-`None` values in `suits` are paired, the loop prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns, leaving the `trumps` list empty and the `answers` list with the pairs that were successfully formed.
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: The `trumps` list is empty, and the loop prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' if the `trumps` list runs out before all non-`None` values in `suits` are paired. The `answers` list contains the pairs that were successfully formed.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The `trumps` list remains empty, and the loop prints all the pairs that were successfully formed from the `answers` list. If the `trumps` list runs out before all non-`None` values in `suits` are paired, 'IMPOSSIBLE' is printed. The `answers` list contains the pairs that were successfully formed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads input from the user to determine the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit `trump_suit`, and a list of 2n unique card strings. It processes these cards to form `n` pairs of cards, where each pair represents a valid round of the game. The function prints the pairs of cards in a specific format: cards of the same suit (excluding the trump suit) are paired and sorted by rank, and any remaining cards are paired with the highest remaining trump cards. If it is not possible to form the required pairs, the function prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` are not modified.
