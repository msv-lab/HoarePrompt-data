Reasoning: 

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The original program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. However, it calls `func_1()` without passing the necessary input parameters. This is incorrect because `func_1()` should be called with the appropriate input for each test case.
   - The corrected program addresses this issue by passing `n`, `trump`, and `cards` to `func_1()`.

2. **Card Processing**:
   - The program correctly identifies trump cards and non-trump cards.
   - It correctly pairs non-trump cards if possible.
   - It correctly handles the case where a non-trump card cannot be paired with another non-trump card and tries to pair it with a trump card.

3. **Handling Remaining Trump Cards**:
   - The program correctly sorts the remaining trump cards and prints pairs of them.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints "IMPOSSIBLE" if it cannot form the required pairs, which is correct.
   - It prints the pairs in the required format.

Given the original assessment, the primary issue was the incorrect input handling. Once this is fixed, the program's logic aligns with the problem description and should produce the correct output for valid inputs.

Final: **False** (due to the input reading issue, but the logic is mostly correct)
