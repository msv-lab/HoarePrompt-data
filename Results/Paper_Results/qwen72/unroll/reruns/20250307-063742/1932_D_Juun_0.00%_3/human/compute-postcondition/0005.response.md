The only objects in the loop head are the `card` variable and the result of `input().split()`. For the loop to execute, the result of `input().split()` must be a non-empty list. This means that the user must provide at least one input when prompted.

State: **`n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` are unchanged, `trump` is a string provided by the user, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S' and all values set to `None`, `card` is the first element from the user's input split by spaces, and the user's input must contain at least one element.**
