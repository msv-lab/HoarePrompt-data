Output State: **The `trumps` list is sorted in ascending order, and the `suits` dictionary remains unchanged for keys with `None` values. For keys with non-`None` values, the corresponding ranks are paired with the highest remaining ranks from the `trumps` list, and these pairs are added to the `answers` list. The `trumps` list is emptied if it had enough ranks to pair with all non-`None` values in `suits`. If the `trumps` list runs out before all non-`None` values in `suits` are paired, the loop prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns, leaving the `trumps` list empty and the `answers` list with the pairs that were successfully formed.**
