Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple non-trump cards of the same suit but no higher-ranked card to beat the lower-ranked card. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
3
S
3C 4C 5C 6C 7C 8C
```

In this case, the program will not be able to find a valid sequence of rounds because it will try to pair each non-trump card with a trump card, but there are no trump cards available. The program will print "IMPOSSIBLE" even though a valid sequence exists (e.g., 3C 4C, 5C 6C, 7C 8C). This indicates that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem.
