The function should take three parameters: `n` (an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16), `trump_suit` (a character from "CDHS"), and `cards` (a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS"). The function should return a list of n pairs of cards, where each pair represents a valid round of the game, or "IMPOSSIBLE" if no such sequence can be reconstructed.
