### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Call:**
   - The outer loop iterates over the number of test cases, which is read from the input.
   - For each test case, the function `func_1` is called. However, the function `func_1` does not take any parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should take `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` as parameters.

2. **Function `func_1` Implementation:**
   - The function reads `n` (the number of rounds) and `trump` (the trump suit) from the input.
   - It initializes `trumps` as a list to store the ranks of trump cards and `answers` as a list to store the pairs of cards that can beat each other.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `suits` to keep track of the last card of each suit that has not been paired yet.

3. **Card Processing:**
   - The function splits the input string of cards and processes each card.
   - If the card's suit matches the trump suit, its rank is added to the `trumps` list.
   - If the card's suit does not match the trump suit and there is already a card of the same suit in `suits`, the two cards are paired and added to `answers`. The entry in `suits` for that suit is then set to `None`.
   - If the card's suit does not match the trump suit and there is no existing card of the same suit in `suits`, the card's rank is stored in `suits`.

4. **Pairing Remaining Cards:**
   - After processing all cards, the function attempts to pair any remaining non-trump cards with trump cards.
   - If there are no trump cards left to pair with a non-trump card, the function prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns.
   - If there are trump cards left, they are sorted and paired with each other, printing the pairs.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints all pairs stored in `answers`.
   - If the function prints "IMPOSSIBLE" at any point, it correctly indicates that no valid sequence of rounds can be reconstructed.

### Issues:
- **Parameter Passing:** The function `func_1` should take parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` to be consistent with the problem description.
- **Input Reading:** The function reads `n` and `trump` from the input inside the function, which is not necessary if these values are passed as parameters.
- **Card Pairing Logic:** The logic for pairing non-trump cards with trump cards is correct, but the function should handle the case where there are more non-trump cards than trump cards more robustly.

### Correctness:
- The function does not correctly handle the parameters as described in the problem statement.
- The function reads input inside the function, which is not necessary and makes the function less modular.
- The function's logic for pairing cards is generally correct, but it could be improved for clarity and robustness.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the parameters as described in the problem statement and reads input inside the function, which is not necessary. Additionally, the function's logic for handling the case where there are more non-trump cards than trump cards could be more robust.
