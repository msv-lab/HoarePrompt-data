Output State: **The `trumps` list is empty, and the loop prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' if the `trumps` list runs out before all non-`None` values in `suits` are paired. The `answers` list contains the pairs that were successfully formed.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as the `trumps` list is not empty.
- In each iteration, the loop attempts to pop two elements from the `trumps` list and print them.
- If the `trumps` list has an odd number of elements, the loop will eventually try to pop the last element, and then it will try to pop an element from an empty list, which will raise an error.
- If the `trumps` list has an even number of elements, the loop will successfully pair and print all elements until the list is empty.
- If the `trumps` list runs out before all non-`None` values in `suits` are paired, the loop prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns, leaving the `trumps` list empty and the `answers` list with the pairs that were successfully formed.
- The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged for keys with `None` values, and for keys with non-`None` values, the corresponding ranks are paired with the highest remaining ranks from the `trumps` list, and these pairs are added to the `answers` list.
