Reasoning:  
The program aims to generate an array `a` that satisfies the conditions \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \). The approach taken by the function `func_1` is to initialize an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to \(10^9\). Then, it iterates backward from the second-to-last element to the first element, setting each `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.

However, this approach is incorrect because it does not ensure that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \). The modulo operation requires that \( a_i \) is greater than or equal to \( x_i \) and that \( a_i \) is a multiple of \( a_{i-1} \) plus \( x_i \). The current implementation simply subtracts `arr[i]` from `ans[i + 1]`, which does not satisfy the modulo condition.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that for each \( i \), \( a_i \) is a multiple of \( a_{i-1} \) plus \( x_i \). One way to achieve this is to set \( a_1 \) to a value that is greater than the maximum \( x_i \) and then set each subsequent \( a_i \) to \( a_{i-1} + x_i \).

Given the current implementation, the program will not produce the correct output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **False**
