You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) = n - 1.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: `ans` is a list where each element from index 0 to index `n-2` is calculated as the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, and `i` is -1.
    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans` where each element from index 0 to index `n-2` is calculated as the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`. The value of `i` is -1, but it is not used in the return statement.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element from index 0 to index `n-2` is calculated as the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`. The last element of `ans` (at index `n-1`) remains unchanged at its initial value of \(10^9\).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the value of `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` becomes less than or equal to 1, which is not allowed according to the problem constraints (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For example, consider the input:

```
1
3
1 1
```

The program will generate the array `ans` as follows:
- Initialize `ans` with `[1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]`.
- For `i = 1`, `ans[1] = ans[2] - arr[1] = 1000000000 - 1 = 999999999`.
- For `i = 0`, `ans[0] = ans[1] - arr[0] = 999999999 - 1 = 999999998`.

This results in `ans = [999999998, 999999999, 1000000000]`.

However, the correct output should satisfy the condition `x_2 = a_2 % a_1` and `x_3 = a_3 % a_2`. In this case:
- `a_2 % a_1 = 999999999 % 999999998 = 1` (which is correct).
- `a_3 % a_2 = 1000000000 % 999999999 = 1` (which is correct).

But if we consider a different input where the subtraction results in a value less than or equal to 1, the program will fail. For example:

```
1
3
1 2
```

The program will generate:
- `ans[1] = ans[2] - arr[1] = 1000000000 - 2 = 999999998`.
- `ans[0] = ans[1] - arr[0] = 999999998 - 1 = 999999997`.

This results in `ans = [999999997, 999999998, 1000000000]`.

However, the correct output should satisfy:
- `a_2 % a_1 = 999999998 % 999999997 = 1` (which is correct).
- `a_3 % a_2 = 1000000000 % 999999998 = 2` (which is correct).

But if we consider a case like:

```
1
3
1 500
```

The program will generate:
- `ans[1] = ans[2] - arr[1] = 1000000000 - 500 = 999999500`.
- `ans[0] = ans[1] - arr[0] = 999999500 - 1 = 999999499`.

This results in `ans = [999999499, 999999500, 1000000000]`.

However, the correct output should satisfy:
- `a_2 % a_1 = 999999500 % 999999499 = 1` (which is correct).
- `a_3 % a_2 = 1000000000 % 999999500 = 500` (which is correct).

But if we consider a case like:

```
1
3
500 1
```

The program will generate:
- `ans[1] = ans[2] - arr[1] = 1000000000 - 1 = 999999999`.
- `ans[0] = ans[1] - arr[0] = 999999999 - 500 = 999999499`.

This results in `ans = [999999499, 999999999, 1000000000]`.

However, the correct output should satisfy:
- `a_2 % a_1 = 999999999 % 999999499 = 500` (which is correct).
- `a_3 % a_2 = 1000000000 % 999999999 = 1` (which is correct).

But if we consider a case like:

```
1
3
500 500
```

The program will generate:
- `ans[1] = ans[2] - arr[1] = 1000000000 - 500 = 999999500`.
- `ans[0] = ans[1] - arr[0] = 999999500 - 500 = 999999000`.

This results in `ans = [999999000, 999999500, 1000000000]`.

However, the correct output should satisfy:
- `a_2 % a_1 = 999999500 % 999999000 = 500` (which is correct).
- `a_3 % a_2 = 1000000000 % 999999500 = 500` (which is correct).

This results in `ans = [999999998, 999999999, 1000000000]`.

However, the correct output should satisfy:

- `a_3 % a_2 = 1000000000 % 999999999 = 1` (which is correct).

But if we consider a case like:

```
1
3
1 501
```

The program will generate:
- `ans[1] = ans[2] - arr[1] = 1000000000 - 501 = 999999499`.
- `ans[0] = ans[1] - arr[0] = 999999499 - 1 = 999999498`.

This results in `ans = [999999498, 999999499, 1000000000]`.

However, the correct output should satisfy:
- `a_2 % a_1 = 999999499 % 999999498 = 1` (which is correct).
- `a_3 % a_2 = 1000000000 % 999999499 = 501` (which is correct).

But if we consider a case like:

```
1
3
500 500
```

The program will generate:
- `ans[1] = ans[2] - arr[1] = 1000000000 - 500 = 999999500`.
- `ans[0] = ans[1] - arr[0] = 999999500 - 500 = 999999000`.

This results in `ans = [999999000, 99
