Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` initializes the array `ans` with all elements set to \(10^9\). However, the logic for updating the elements of `ans` is flawed. Specifically, the line `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` does not ensure that the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) is satisfied.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that for each \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\). This can be achieved by setting \(a_i\) to a value that is greater than or equal to \(a_{i-1}\) and satisfies the modulo condition. A simple and correct approach is to set \(a_1\) to a value greater than the maximum \(x_i\) and then set each subsequent \(a_i\) to \(a_{i-1} + x_i\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    # Initialize a_1 to a value greater than the maximum x_i
    ans = [max(arr) + 1]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        # Set a_i to a_{i-1} + x_{i+1}
        ans.append(ans[-1] + arr[i])
    return ans
```

This corrected program ensures that the conditions are met for all test cases.
