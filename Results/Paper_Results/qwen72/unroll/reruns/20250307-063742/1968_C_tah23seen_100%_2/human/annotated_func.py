#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) = n - 1.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: `ans` is a list where each element from index 0 to index `n-2` is calculated as the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, and `i` is -1.
    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans` where each element from index 0 to index `n-2` is calculated as the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`. The value of `i` is -1, but it is not used in the return statement.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element from index 0 to index `n-2` is calculated as the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`. The last element of `ans` (at index `n-1`) remains unchanged at its initial value of \(10^9\).
