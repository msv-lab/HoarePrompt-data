You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) = n - 1.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: `ans` is a list where each element from index 0 to index `n-2` is calculated as the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, and `i` is -1.
    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans` where each element from index 0 to index `n-2` is calculated as the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`. The value of `i` is -1, but it is not used in the return statement.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element from index 0 to index `n-2` is calculated as the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`. The last element of `ans` (at index `n-1`) remains unchanged at its initial value of \(10^9\).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` containing `n-1` elements `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to \(10^9\). This is a valid starting point because \(10^9\) is within the allowed range for \(a_i\).

3. **Backward Calculation:**
   - The program then iterates backward from `n-2` to `0` (inclusive) to calculate the values of `ans[i]` based on the given condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\).
   - The formula used is `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. This formula is derived from the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\), which implies \(a_i = k \cdot a_{i-1} + x_i\) for some integer \(k\). To ensure \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\), we can choose \(a_i = a_{i-1} - x_i\) (assuming \(a_{i-1} > x_i\)).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the resulting array `ans` for each test case, which should satisfy the given conditions.

### Verification of the Formula:
- For \(a_i = a_{i-1} - x_i\), we need to ensure that \(a_{i-1} > x_i\) to avoid negative values.
- Since \(a_{i-1}\) is initially set to \(10^9\), and \(x_i\) is at most 500, the subtraction will always result in a positive value within the allowed range.

### Example Walkthrough:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `n = 4`, `arr = [2, 4, 1]`
  - Initialize `ans = [1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]`
  - Calculate:
    - `ans[2] = ans[3] - arr[2] = 1000000000 - 1 = 999999999`
    - `ans[1] = ans[2] - arr[1] = 999999999 - 4 = 999999995`
    - `ans[0] = ans[1] - arr[0] = 999999995 - 2 = 999999993`
  - Output: `999999993 999999995 999999999 1000000000`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `n = 3`, `arr = [1, 1]`
  - Initialize `ans = [1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]`
  - Calculate:
    - `ans[1] = ans[2] - arr[1] = 1000000000 - 1 = 999999999`
    - `ans[0] = ans[1] - arr[0] = 999999999 - 1 = 999999998`
  - Output: `999999998 999999999 1000000000`

### Issues:
- The formula `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` does not always ensure that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\). Specifically, it does not handle cases where \(a_{i-1}\) is not a multiple of \(x_i\).
- A correct approach would be to set \(a_{i-1} = x_i + k \cdot a_i\) for some integer \(k\). To simplify, we can set \(a_{i-1} = x_i + a_i\).

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[-1] = 10 ** 9  # Set the last element to a large value
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        ans[i] = arr[i] + ans[i + 1]
    return ans
```

### Correctness:
- The corrected program ensures that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\) by setting \(a_{i-1} = x_i + a_i\).
- This approach guarantees that \(a_{i-1}\) is always greater than \(x_i\) and the modulo condition is satisfied.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original program does not correctly handle the modulo condition and may produce incorrect results. The corrected program provided above should be used instead.
