Output State: **`ans` is a list where each element from index 0 to index `n-2` is calculated as the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, and `i` is -1.**

Natural language explanation: After the loop finishes executing, the list `ans` will have its elements from index 0 to index `n-2` updated. Each element at index `i` in `ans` will be the result of subtracting the element at index `i` in `arr` from the element at index `i + 1` in `ans`. The variable `i` will be -1, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
