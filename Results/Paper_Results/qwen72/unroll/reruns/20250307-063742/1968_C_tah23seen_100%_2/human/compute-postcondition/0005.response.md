The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `n`. `arr` is a list of integers where the length of `arr` is between 1 and 500, and each element in `arr` is between 1 and 500. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and the length of `arr` is `n - 1`.

The function returns a list `ans` where each element from index 0 to index `n-2` is calculated as the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` where each element from index 0 to index `n-2` is the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`.**
