Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element from index 0 to index `n-2` is calculated as the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`. The last element of `ans` (at index `n-1`) remains unchanged at its initial value of \(10^9\). **
