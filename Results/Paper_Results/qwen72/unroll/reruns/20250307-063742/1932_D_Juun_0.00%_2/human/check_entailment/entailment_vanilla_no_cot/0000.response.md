Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1()` is called inside the loop without passing any arguments, but the function itself does not take any arguments. This is fine, but the function should be defined to handle the input and output correctly.

2. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` assumes that the input is already read, but it should read the input itself. The current implementation reads the input outside the function, which is not a good practice and can lead to issues in a real-world scenario.

3. **Trump Card Handling**: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple trump cards of different ranks correctly. It only appends the rank to the `trumps` list, but it should also store the suit.

4. **Sorting and Popping Trumps**: The program sorts the `trumps` list and pops elements from it, but it does not handle the case where there are not enough trump cards to beat all non-trump cards. It should check if there are enough trump cards before attempting to beat non-trump cards.

5. **Output Format**: The program does not print the answers in the correct format for each test case. It should print the answers for each test case separately and handle the "IMPOSSIBLE" case correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    trump = input().strip()
    cards = input().strip().split()
    
    trumps = []
    non_trumps = {'C': [], 'D': [], 'H': [], 'S': []}
    
    for card in cards:
        rank, suit = card[0], card[1]
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(card)
        else:
            non_trumps[suit].append(card)
    
    answers = []
    
    for suit in non_trumps:
        while len(non_trumps[suit]) > 1:
            non_trumps[suit].sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
            answers.append(f'{non_trumps[suit].pop(0)} {non_trumps[suit].pop(0)}')
    
    for suit in non_trumps:
        if non_trumps[suit]:
            if trumps:
                answers.append(f'{non_trumps[suit].pop(0)} {trumps.pop(0)}')
            else:
                print('IMPOSSIBLE')
                return
    
    trumps.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    while len(trumps) > 1:
        answers.append(f'{trumps.pop(0)} {trumps.pop(0)}')
    
    if trumps:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return
    
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` reads the input for each test case.
2. **Trump and Non-trump Cards**: It separates the cards into trump and non-trump categories.
3. **Non-trump Card Pairs**: It pairs non-trump cards of the same suit, ensuring the second card has a higher rank.
4. **Trump Card Pairs**: It pairs remaining non-trump cards with trump cards.
5. **Output**: It prints the pairs in the correct format and handles the "IMPOSSIBLE" case when there are not enough trump cards to beat all non-trump cards.
