Output State: **`trumps` is a list containing the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit. `answers` is a list containing strings of pairs of ranks for each suit (other than the trump suit) that had two cards played, with the ranks sorted in ascending order and the suit appended. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values set to `None` for all suits that had two cards played, and the remaining suits (if any) have values set to the rank of the last card played of that suit. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.**
