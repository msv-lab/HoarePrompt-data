Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `answers` and `suits` remain unchanged, and the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as the `trumps` list is not empty.
- In each iteration, the loop removes two elements from the `trumps` list and prints them.
- Once the loop has finished executing, the `trumps` list will be empty because all its elements have been removed.
- The `answers` and `suits` variables are not modified within the loop, so they retain their initial values.
- The variables `t` and `n` are also not modified within the loop, so they remain unchanged.
