You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16, the trump suit is a character from the set "CDHS", and the list of 2n cards contains unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS".
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: `trumps` is a list containing the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit. `answers` is a list containing strings of pairs of ranks for each suit (other than the trump suit) that had two cards played, with the ranks sorted in ascending order and the suit appended. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values set to `None` for all suits that had two cards played, and the remaining suits (if any) have values set to the rank of the last card played of that suit. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: Output State: `trumps` is a list containing the remaining ranks of cards that have the trump suit after the loop has finished executing. `answers` is a list containing strings of pairs of ranks for each suit (other than the trump suit) that had two cards played, with the ranks sorted in ascending order and the suit appended, plus any additional pairs formed by the last card played of a suit and the last trump card. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values set to `None` for all suits that had two cards played, and the remaining suits (if any) have values set to the rank of the last card played of that suit. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` and `suits` remain unchanged, and the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` and `uits` remain unchanged, and the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The loop has printed each element in the `answers` list to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t`, an integer `n`, a character `trump_suit` from "CDHS", and a list of 2n unique two-character strings representing cards. The function returns a result based on the given inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
