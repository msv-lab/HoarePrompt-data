Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a set of card inputs and a trump suit to generate and print pairs of cards. It accepts no parameters directly but relies on user input for the trump suit and a list of 2n unique card strings. The function prints pairs of cards for each suit (other than the trump suit) that had two cards played, with the ranks sorted in ascending order. If there are any remaining trump cards, it pairs them and prints them as well. If no trump cards are left to pair with a remaining suit card, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'. The function does not return any value, and the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged throughout the execution. **
