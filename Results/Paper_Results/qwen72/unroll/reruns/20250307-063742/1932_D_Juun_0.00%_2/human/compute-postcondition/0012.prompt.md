Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `trumps` is a sorted list containing the remaining ranks of cards that have the trump suit after the loop has finished executing. `answers` is a list containing strings of pairs of ranks for each suit (other than the trump suit) that had two cards played, with the ranks sorted in ascending order and the suit appended, plus any additional pairs formed by the last card played of a suit and the last trump card. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values set to `None` for all suits that had two cards played, and the remaining suits (if any) have values set to the rank of the last card played of that suit. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while trumps != []:
    print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
