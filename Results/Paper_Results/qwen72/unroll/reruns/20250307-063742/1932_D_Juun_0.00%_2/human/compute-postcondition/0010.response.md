Output State: **`trumps` is a sorted list containing the remaining ranks of cards that have the trump suit after the loop has finished executing. `answers` is a list containing strings of pairs of ranks for each suit (other than the trump suit) that had two cards played, with the ranks sorted in ascending order and the suit appended, plus any additional pairs formed by the last card played of a suit and the last trump card. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values set to `None` for all suits that had two cards played, and the remaining suits (if any) have values set to the rank of the last card played of that suit. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.**
