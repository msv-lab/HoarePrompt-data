Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple non-trump cards of the same suit that cannot be beaten by any other card of the same suit, and there are no trump cards available to beat them. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
3
S
3C 4C 5C 6C 7C 8C
```

In this case, the program will incorrectly try to pair each non-trump card with a trump card, but there are no trump cards available. The program will print "IMPOSSIBLE" even though there is a valid sequence of rounds:

```
3C 4C
5C 6C
7C 8C
```

This shows that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem.
