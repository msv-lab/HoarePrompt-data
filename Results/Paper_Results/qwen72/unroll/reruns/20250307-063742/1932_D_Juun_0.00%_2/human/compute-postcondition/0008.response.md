Output State: `trumps` is a list containing the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit, but with the last card(s) removed for each non-trump suit that had a card played. `answers` is a list containing strings of pairs of ranks for each suit (other than the trump suit) that had two cards played, and for each non-trump suit that had a card played, a string is appended to `answers` in the format `'{rank}{suit} {trump_rank}{trump}'`, where `rank` is the rank of the last card played of that suit, and `trump_rank` is the rank of the trump card that was popped from `trumps`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values set to `None` for all suits that had two cards played, and the remaining suits (if any) have values set to the rank of the last card played of that suit, but these values are not modified by the loop.
