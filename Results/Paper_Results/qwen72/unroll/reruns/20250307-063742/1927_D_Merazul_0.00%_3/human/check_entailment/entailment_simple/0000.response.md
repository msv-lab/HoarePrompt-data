**Reasoning:**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the length of the array `n` but does not use it. Instead, it reads `k` which is not defined in the problem statement.
   - The array `a` is read into a set, which means that it loses the order of elements and duplicates are removed. This is problematic because the problem requires finding indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` within a specific range, and sets do not preserve this information.
   - The program also reads another set `b`, which is not used in the problem and seems to be an unnecessary step.

2. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `k + 1`, but `k` is not defined and should be `n` (the length of the array).
   - The variables `u` and `v` check if `i` is in sets `a` and `b`, respectively. This is not relevant to the problem, which requires checking elements within a specific range `[l, r]` for each query.
   - The variables `m` and `n` are updated in a way that does not correspond to the problem's requirements. The problem is about finding two different elements within a range, not about counting elements or checking their presence in sets.
   - The final print statement outputs 'YNEOS' based on the value of `f` and the conditions `m` and `n`, which are not aligned with the problem's output requirements (i.e., indices `i` and `j` or `-1 -1`).

3. **Output Mismatch:**
   - The output format is incorrect. The problem requires outputting two indices `i` and `j` or `-1 -1` for each query, but the program outputs 'YES' or 'NO' based on some internal logic that is not related to the problem.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for the problem described.

**Correctness: False**
