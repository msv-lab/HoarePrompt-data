The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `k` and two sets of integers `a` and `b`, each containing `k` elements. It then checks if every integer from 1 to `k` is present in either `a` or `b`. Additionally, it ensures that the number of elements in `a` that are not in `b` and the number of elements in `b` that are not in `a` are both non-negative. The function outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether these conditions are met. After processing all test cases, the function completes execution, and the variable `t` is decremented to 0.
