Output State: **`t` is the first integer read from the input, `R` is a function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the array `a`. The array `a` contains `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of queries. Each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
