Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the array a. The array a contains n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. q is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of queries. Each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. R is a function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer.**

The function `R` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer. This function can be used to read multiple integers from a single line of input. The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `q` remain unchanged, and the constraints specified for them are still valid.
