You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the array a. The array a contains n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. q is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of queries. Each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

    #State: The loop finishes executing all iterations, and the final output is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses (represented as 'Y' or 'N' in the print statement) for each test case, depending on whether the conditions inside the loop are met. The variable `t` is decremented to 0, and the variables `a`, `b`, `f`, `m`, and `n` are updated for each test case but reset for the next test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `k` and two sets of integers `a` and `b`, each containing `k` elements. It then checks if every integer from 1 to `k` is present in either `a` or `b`. Additionally, it ensures that the number of elements in `a` that are not in `b` and the number of elements in `b` that are not in `a` are both non-negative. The function outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether these conditions are met. After processing all test cases, the function completes execution, and the variable `t` is decremented to 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it does not handle the input and output format correctly as specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program incorrectly reads the input. It reads the number of test cases `t`, but then it tries to read the length of the array `k` and the array `a` in a single line, which is not how the input is structured. The correct input structure should be:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Read the length of the array `n`.
     - Read the array `a`.
     - Read the number of queries `q`.
     - Read each query `l` and `r`.

2. **Output Handling**: The program's output format is incorrect. It prints a string "YNEOS" based on some conditions, which is not what the problem description requires. The problem description requires the output to be two indices `i` and `j` for each query, or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

3. **Logic**: The logic in the program does not match the problem description. The program is trying to check if each number from 1 to `k` is in the sets `a` and `b`, which is not relevant to the problem of finding two different indices in a subarray.

Here is a case where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5
  1 1 2 1 1
  3
  1 5
  1 2
  1 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  2 3
  -1 -1
  1 3
  ```
- Actual Output:
  The program will produce an incorrect output because it does not correctly parse the input and does not implement the required logic.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
