Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding two indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a specified range of an array such that \(a_i \ne a_j\). However, the given program is attempting to solve a different problem, likely a problem involving set operations and checking if elements are present in sets \(a\) and \(b\), which are not part of the original problem statement.

Here is a more appropriate solution for the problem:

```python
def solve_queries():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        q = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[idx])
            r = int(data[idx+1])
            idx += 2
            
            found = False
            for i in range(l-1, r):
                for j in range(i+1, r):
                    if a[i] != a[j]:
                        results.append(f"{i+1} {j+1}")
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                results.append("-1 -1")
    
    print("\n".join(results))

solve_queries()
```

This solution reads the input in bulk, processes each test case and query, and outputs the results as required. It checks for the presence of two different elements within the specified range and outputs the indices if found, or \(-1 -1\) otherwise.
