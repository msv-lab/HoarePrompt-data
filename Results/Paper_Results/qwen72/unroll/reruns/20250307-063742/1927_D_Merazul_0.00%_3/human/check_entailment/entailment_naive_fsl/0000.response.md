Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it does not handle the input and output format correctly as specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program incorrectly reads the input. It reads the number of test cases `t`, but then it tries to read the length of the array `k` and the array `a` in a single line, which is not how the input is structured. The correct input structure should be:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Read the length of the array `n`.
     - Read the array `a`.
     - Read the number of queries `q`.
     - Read each query `l` and `r`.

2. **Output Handling**: The program's output format is incorrect. It prints a string "YNEOS" based on some conditions, which is not what the problem description requires. The problem description requires the output to be two indices `i` and `j` for each query, or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

3. **Logic**: The logic in the program does not match the problem description. The program is trying to check if each number from 1 to `k` is in the sets `a` and `b`, which is not relevant to the problem of finding two different indices in a subarray.

Here is a case where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5
  1 1 2 1 1
  3
  1 5
  1 2
  1 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  2 3
  -1 -1
  1 3
  ```
- Actual Output:
  The program will produce an incorrect output because it does not correctly parse the input and does not implement the required logic.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
