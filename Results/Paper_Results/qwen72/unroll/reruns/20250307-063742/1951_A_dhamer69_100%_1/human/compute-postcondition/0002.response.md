Output State: **`t` is 0, and the loop has finished executing. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration until `t` is no longer greater than 0. Once `t` reaches 0, the loop condition `t > 0` becomes false, and the loop terminates. The values of `start` and `end` are not modified within the loop, so they remain the same as they were in the initial state.
