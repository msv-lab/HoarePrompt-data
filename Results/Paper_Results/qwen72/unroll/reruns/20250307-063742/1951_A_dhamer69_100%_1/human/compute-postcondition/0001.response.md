The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` must be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`start` and `end` are integers, and `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0**
