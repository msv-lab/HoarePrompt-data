The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sChar`. `sChar` is a binary string consisting of only '0' and '1' characters, with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 \cdot 10^5. The function returns the total number of swaps performed to move all '1's to the left and all '0's to the right in the list `sChar`.
