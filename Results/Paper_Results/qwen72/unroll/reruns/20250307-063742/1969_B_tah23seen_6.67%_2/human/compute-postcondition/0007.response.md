Output State: **`s` is a list with all '1's moved to the left and all '0's moved to the right, `left` is the index of the first '0' (or the length of the list if there are no '0's), `cost` is the total number of swaps performed, `right` is the index of the first '0' (or the length of the list if there are no '0's).**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and both `left` and `right` are within the bounds of the list `s`.
- The loop swaps '1's and '0's in the list `s` to move all '1's to the left and all '0's to the right.
- The variable `cost` keeps track of the total number of swaps performed.
- After the loop finishes, `left` and `right` will both point to the first '0' in the list, or to the length of the list if there are no '0's left.
- The list `s` will be sorted with all '1's on the left and all '0's on the right.
