Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. However, the implementation in `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Cyclic Shift Implementation**: The function `func_1` is attempting to swap characters directly, which is not a cyclic shift. A cyclic shift involves moving the last character of the substring to the front and shifting all other characters to the right. The current implementation only swaps two characters, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation in the function is based on the number of swaps, which is not the same as the cost of cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted. The function's current logic does not correctly compute this cost.

3. **Efficiency and Correctness**: The function's logic for finding the next '0' and '1' is inefficient and does not guarantee the optimal solution. The problem can be solved more efficiently by considering the number of transitions from '1' to '0' in the string and the length of the string.

A correct approach to solve this problem would involve:
- Counting the number of '1's and '0's in the string.
- Identifying the number of transitions from '1' to '0' in the string.
- The minimum cost to sort the string is the length of the string minus the number of '1's if the string starts with '0' or the length of the string minus the number of '0's if the string starts with '1'.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
