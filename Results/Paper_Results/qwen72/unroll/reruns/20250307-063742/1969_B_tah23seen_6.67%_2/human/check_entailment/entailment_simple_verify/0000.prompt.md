You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

    #State: `s` is a list with all '1's moved to the left and all '0's moved to the right, `left` is the index of the first '0' (or the length of the list if there are no '0's), `cost` is the total number of swaps performed, `right` is the index of the first '0' (or the length of the list if there are no '0's).
    return cost
    #The program returns the total number of swaps performed to move all '1's to the left and all '0's to the right in the list `s`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. One specific case where the program fails is when the string is already sorted but has a '1' at the beginning and a '0' at the end. For example, the string "1000" should have a cost of 0 since it is already sorted in non-descending order. However, the program will incorrectly swap the '1' and '0' and return a cost of 4.

Let's break down the issue:
- The program initializes `left` and `right` pointers and iterates through the string to find '1's and '0's.
- It swaps '1's and '0's whenever it finds a '0' to the right of a '1'.
- However, it does not correctly handle the case where the string is already sorted but has a '1' at the beginning and a '0' at the end.

For the string "1000":
- The program will find the '0' at index 1 and the '1' at index 0.
- It will swap them, resulting in "0100".
- It will then find the '0' at index 2 and the '1' at index 1.
- It will swap them, resulting in "0010".
- It will then find the '0' at index 3 and the '1' at index 2.
- It will swap them, resulting in "0001".
- The total cost will be 4, which is incorrect since the string was already sorted.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
