Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. One specific case where the program fails is when the string is already sorted but has a '1' at the beginning and a '0' at the end. For example, the string "1000" should have a cost of 0 since it is already sorted in non-descending order. However, the program will incorrectly swap the '1' and '0' and return a cost of 4.

Let's break down the issue:
- The program initializes `left` and `right` pointers and iterates through the string to find '1's and '0's.
- It swaps '1's and '0's whenever it finds a '0' to the right of a '1'.
- However, it does not correctly handle the case where the string is already sorted but has a '1' at the beginning and a '0' at the end.

For the string "1000":
- The program will find the '0' at index 1 and the '1' at index 0.
- It will swap them, resulting in "0100".
- It will then find the '0' at index 2 and the '1' at index 1.
- It will swap them, resulting in "0010".
- It will then find the '0' at index 3 and the '1' at index 2.
- It will swap them, resulting in "0001".
- The total cost will be 4, which is incorrect since the string was already sorted.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
