You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a binary string (consisting of only '0' and '1' characters) with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: s is a list containing the characters of the binary string sChar in the same order.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: `s` is a list with all '1's moved to the left and all '0's moved to the right, `left` is the index of the first '0' (or the length of the list if there are no '0's), `cost` is the total number of swaps performed, `right` is the index of the first '0' (or the length of the list if there are no '0's).
    return cost
    #The program returns the total number of swaps performed to move all '1's to the left and all '0's to the right in the list `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a binary string `sChar` and returns the total number of swaps needed to move all '1's to the left and all '0's to the right in the string. After the function concludes, the input string `sChar` remains unchanged, and the function does not modify any external state. The function's primary purpose is to compute the cost of rearranging the characters in the string to achieve the desired order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's should come before all '1's) using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of each shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - We need to minimize the total cost of all shifts.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The provided program uses a while loop to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` with the binary string `sChar`.
   - Inside `func_1`, the string `sChar` is converted to a list `s` to allow in-place modifications.
   - Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
   - The program then iterates through the string, swapping '1's and '0's when necessary to sort the string.
   - The cost is calculated as the length of the substring being shifted (`right - left + 1`).

3. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `left` and `right` pointers are set to 0 and 1.
     - `cost` is initialized to 0.
   - **Main Loop:**
     - The loop continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right` and both are within the bounds of the string.
     - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', a swap is performed, and the cost is updated.
     - After a swap, `right` is incremented until it finds a '0', and `left` is incremented until it finds a '1'.
   - **Termination:**
     - The loop terminates when `right` or `left` exceeds the length of the string.
     - The function returns the total cost.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Handling of Test Cases:**
     - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - **String Conversion:**
     - The string `sChar` is correctly converted to a list `s` to allow in-place modifications.
   - **Swapping Logic:**
     - The program correctly identifies and swaps '1's and '0's to sort the string.
     - The cost calculation is correct for each swap.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - The program handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by not performing any swaps and returning a cost of 0.
     - The program handles the case where the string is not sorted (e.g., "101011") by performing the necessary swaps and calculating the correct cost.

5. **Optimality:**
   - The program ensures that the string is sorted in the minimum number of operations by always swapping the first '1' with the first '0' it encounters.
   - The cost is calculated correctly for each operation.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem by sorting the binary string using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts. The logic and implementation are sound and handle all edge cases as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
