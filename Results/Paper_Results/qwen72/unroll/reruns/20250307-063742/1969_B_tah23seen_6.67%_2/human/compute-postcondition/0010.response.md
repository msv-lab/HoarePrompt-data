Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a binary string `sChar` and returns the total number of swaps needed to move all '1's to the left and all '0's to the right in the string. After the function concludes, the input string `sChar` remains unchanged, and the function does not modify any external state. The function's primary purpose is to compute the cost of rearranging the characters in the string to achieve the desired order. **
