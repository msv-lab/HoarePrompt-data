The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `sChar`. The loop will execute if `sChar` is not empty. Given that the state before the loop starts specifies `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 \cdot 10^5, this ensures that `sChar` is not empty, and thus the loop will execute. However, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to reflect the initial condition of the loop, where `i` will be the first character of `sChar`.

State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is the first character of `sChar`, `s` is an empty list**
