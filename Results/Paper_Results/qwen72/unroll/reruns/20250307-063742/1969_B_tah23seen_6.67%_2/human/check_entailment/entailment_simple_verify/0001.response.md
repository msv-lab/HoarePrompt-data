### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of each shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The objective is to minimize the total cost of all shifts.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` with the binary string `sChar`.
   - Inside `func_1`, the string `sChar` is converted to a list `s` to allow in-place modifications.
   - Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are used to find and swap '1's and '0's.

3. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `left` and `right` pointers are set to 0 and 1, respectively.
     - `cost` is initialized to 0.
   - **Main Loop:**
     - The loop continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right` and both are within the bounds of the string.
     - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', a swap is performed, and the cost is updated.
     - After a swap, `right` is incremented until it finds a '0', and `left` is incremented until it finds a '1'.
   - **Termination:**
     - The loop terminates when `right` or `left` exceeds the length of the string.
     - The function returns the total cost.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Handling of Test Cases:**
     - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - **String Conversion:**
     - The string `sChar` is correctly converted to a list `s` to allow in-place modifications.
   - **Swapping Logic:**
     - The program correctly identifies and swaps '1's and '0's to sort the string.
     - The cost calculation is correct for each swap.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - The program handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by not performing any swaps and returning a cost of 0.
     - The program handles the case where the string is not sorted (e.g., "101011") by performing the necessary swaps and calculating the correct cost.

5. **Optimality:**
   - The program ensures that the string is sorted in the minimum number of operations by always swapping the first '1' with the first '0' it encounters.
   - The cost is calculated correctly for each operation.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:
- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `sChar` is a binary string with valid length constraints.
- **State After String Conversion:**
  - `s` is a list containing the characters of `sChar` in the same order.
- **Main Loop:**
  - The loop correctly identifies and swaps '1's and '0's.
  - The cost is updated correctly for each swap.
  - The inner loops for incrementing `right` and `left` ensure that the next '0' and '1' are found, respectively.
- **Final State:**
  - `s` is a list with all '1's moved to the left and all '0's moved to the right.
  - `left` and `right` are correctly positioned to reflect the final state of the string.
  - `cost` is the total number of swaps performed.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem by sorting the binary string using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts. The logic and implementation are sound and handle all edge cases as described in the problem.

Final: **True**
