Reasoning:

The program aims to compute the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The function `func_1` is designed to achieve this by:

1. Converting the binary string `sChar` into a list `s` to facilitate character manipulation.
2. Initializing `left` and `right` pointers to 0 and 1, respectively, and a `cost` variable to 0.
3. Iterating through the list `s` to find and swap '1's and '0's that are out of order, while updating the `cost` with the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.
4. Moving the `right` pointer to the next '0' and the `left` pointer to the next '1' to continue the process.
5. Returning the total `cost` after all necessary swaps have been made.

However, there are a few issues in the implementation:

1. **Infinite Loop Potential**: The while loop condition `while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s))` can lead to an infinite loop if the `right` pointer is not properly incremented or if the `left` pointer is not properly updated. Specifically, if the string is already sorted or if there are no more '1's or '0's to swap, the loop might not terminate correctly.

2. **Incorrect Swapping Logic**: The swapping logic `s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]` is incorrect for cyclic shifts. A cyclic shift involves moving the last character of the substring to the front, not a simple swap of two characters. The current logic only swaps the '1' and '0' at the `left` and `right` indices, which does not achieve the desired cyclic shift.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation `cost += right - left + 1` is correct for the length of the substring being shifted, but the actual cyclic shift operation is not implemented correctly.

4. **Handling Already Sorted Strings**: The function does not handle cases where the string is already sorted or where there are no '1's or '0's to swap, which can lead to incorrect results or infinite loops.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
