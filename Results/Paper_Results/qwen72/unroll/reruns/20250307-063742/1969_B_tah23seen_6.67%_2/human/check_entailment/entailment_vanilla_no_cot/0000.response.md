Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it only swaps the first '1' and the first '0' it finds, and it does not consider the optimal way to sort the string using cyclic shifts. The program also does not handle all edge cases and does not ensure that the string is sorted in non-descending order.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider the following:

1. **Identify the Transition Points**: The key to solving this problem is to identify the points where the string transitions from '1' to '0'. These points indicate where a cyclic shift might be necessary to sort the string.

2. **Calculate the Minimum Cost**: The minimum cost to sort the string is the minimum of the sum of the lengths of the substrings that need to be cyclically shifted to move all '1's to the left and all '0's to the right.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    # Count the number of '1's in the string
    ones = s.count('1')
    
    # If the string is already sorted, the cost is 0
    if ones == 0 or ones == n:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize the minimum cost to the length of the string
    min_cost = n
    
    # Count the number of '0's before the first '1'
    zeros_before_first_one = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            break
        zeros_before_first_one += 1
    
    # Calculate the cost of moving all '1's to the left
    cost = zeros_before_first_one + ones
    
    # Update the minimum cost
    min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    
    # Calculate the cost of moving all '0's to the right
    zeros_after_last_one = 0
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == '0':
            zeros_after_last_one += 1
        else:
            break
    
    # Calculate the cost of moving all '0's to the right
    cost = zeros_after_last_one + (n - ones)
    
    # Update the minimum cost
    min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    
    # Calculate the cost of cyclic shifts for each possible transition point
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i-1] == '1' and s[i] == '0':
            cost = n - i + 1
            min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    
    return min_cost

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = input()
    print(min_cost_to_sort(s))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Count the Number of '1's**: This helps determine if the string is already sorted (all '1's or all '0's).
2. **Initial Minimum Cost**: Start with the assumption that the entire string needs to be shifted.
3. **Count '0's Before the First '1'**: This gives the cost of moving all '1's to the left.
4. **Count '0's After the Last '1'**: This gives the cost of moving all '0's to the right.
5. **Transition Points**: For each transition from '1' to '0', calculate the cost of a cyclic shift and update the minimum cost accordingly.

This approach ensures that the string is sorted with the minimum total cost.
