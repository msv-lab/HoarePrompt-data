To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to check the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states of the variables `left`, `right`, and `s` if necessary.

The loop condition is:
```
left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s))
```

Let's break down the conditions:
1. `left <= right`: Given that `left` is 0 and `right` is 1, this condition is already satisfied.
2. `right < len(s)`: Given that `right` is 1, this condition will be satisfied if `len(s)` is greater than 1.
3. `left < len(s)`: Given that `left` is 0, this condition will be satisfied if `len(s)` is greater than 0.

Since `left` and `right` are already set to values that satisfy the first two conditions, we only need to ensure that `len(s)` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`s` is a list containing the characters of the binary string `sChar` in the same order and `len(s)` must be greater than 1, `left` is 0, `cost` is 0, `right` is 1**
