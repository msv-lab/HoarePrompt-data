Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, inclusive, representing the number of vertices in the tree; `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list containing `n` empty lists. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `u2vs` will have `n` elements, each of which is an empty list. The value of `n` remains unchanged.
