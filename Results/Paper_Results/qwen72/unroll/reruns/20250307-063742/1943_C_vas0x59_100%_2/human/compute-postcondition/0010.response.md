Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices from `b` to `0` in the reverse order of the BFS traversal path, and `n` is the index of the last vertex added to `path_ba` before the loop terminates.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to append the previous vertex in the BFS traversal path to `path_ba` until it reaches the starting vertex (vertex 0), which is indicated by `previous[path_ba[-1]]` being `-1`.
- `path_ba` starts with the value of `b` and ends with the value of `0`, representing the path from `b` back to `0` in the BFS tree.
- `n` is the index of the last vertex added to `path_ba` before the loop breaks, which is the vertex immediately before `0` in the path from `b` to `0`. If `b` is `0`, `n` will be `-1` and `path_ba` will contain only `[0]`.
