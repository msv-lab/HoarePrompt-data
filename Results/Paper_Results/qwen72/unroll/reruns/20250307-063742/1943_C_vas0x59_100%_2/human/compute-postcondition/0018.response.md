Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices from `b` to `0` in the reverse order of the BFS traversal path, `n` is the index of the last vertex added to `path_ba` before the loop terminates, `ops` is an empty list, `ci2` is equal to the length of `path_ba` divided by 2.**

Explanation: The variable `ci2` is assigned the value of the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 using integer division. Since the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci2` will be an integer. The other variables (`path_ba`, `n`, and `ops`) remain unchanged.
