Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the vertex corresponding to the list's index. `d` is the distance (or level) of each vertex from vertex 0 as computed by the BFS algorithm. `_` is a discarded variable. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the result of the function `func_1` when called with `d` as its argument. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, and `_`) remain unchanged. The specific value of `a` depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the current value of `d`.
