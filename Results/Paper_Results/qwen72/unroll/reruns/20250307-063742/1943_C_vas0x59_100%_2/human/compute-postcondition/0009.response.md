For the `while True:` loop, there are no conditions in the loop head that need to be checked or adjusted for the loop to execute. The `while True:` loop will always execute at least once, regardless of the program state before it.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the vertex corresponding to the list's index. `d` is the distance (or level) of each vertex from vertex 0 as computed by the BFS algorithm starting from `a`. `previous` is the list of previous vertices in the BFS traversal. `_` is a discarded variable. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`.**
