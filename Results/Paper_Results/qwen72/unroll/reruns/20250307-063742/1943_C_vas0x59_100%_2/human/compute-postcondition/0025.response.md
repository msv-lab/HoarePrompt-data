To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code snippet step by step:

1. **`path_ba`**: This is a list containing the indices of vertices from `b` to `0` in the reverse order of the BFS traversal path.
2. **`n`**: This is the index of the last vertex added to `path_ba` before the loop terminates. However, `n` is not directly relevant to the `ops` list.
3. **`ops`**: The list `ops` is determined based on the length of `path_ba`:
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is an empty list.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing tuples where the first element is `c` (the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`) and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive, where `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.

Let's analyze the two cases:

### Case 1: Length of `path_ba` is Even
- If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is an empty list.
- Therefore, `len(ops)` will be 0.

### Case 2: Length of `path_ba` is Odd
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing tuples.
- The middle index of `path_ba` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.
- The value of `c` is `path_ba[len(path_ba) // 2]`.
- The range for `i` is from 0 to `ci` inclusive, where `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.
- Therefore, `ops` will contain `ci + 1` tuples, each of the form `(c, i)`.

### Final Output
- If the length of `path_ba` is even, the output will be 0.
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the output will be `ci + 1`, where `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not provided, we need to consider both cases:

Output: **0 (if the length of `path_ba` is even) or `len(path_ba) // 2 + 1` (if the length of `path_ba` is odd)**
