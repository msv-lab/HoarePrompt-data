Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the vertex corresponding to the list's index. `d` is the distance (or level) of each vertex from vertex 0 as computed by the BFS algorithm starting from `a`. `previous` is the list of previous vertices in the BFS traversal. `_` is a discarded variable. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.**
