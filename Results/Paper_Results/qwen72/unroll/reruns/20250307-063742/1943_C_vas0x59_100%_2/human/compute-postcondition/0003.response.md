Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the vertex corresponding to the list's index.**

Explanation: The loop iterates `n - 1` times, and in each iteration, it reads two integers `u` and `v` from the input, adjusts them to be 0-indexed, and then appends `v` to the list at index `u` in `u2vs` and appends `u` to the list at index `v` in `u2vs`. This effectively builds an adjacency list representation of a tree with `n` vertices. Each list in `u2vs` will contain the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the vertex corresponding to that list's index.
