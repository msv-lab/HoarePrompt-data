The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads from the standard input to construct a tree represented as a list of adjacency lists `u2vs`. The first line of the input contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3), which represents the number of vertices in the tree. The following `n - 1` lines each contain two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v), representing the edges of the tree. The function constructs the adjacency list `u2vs` such that `u2vs[u]` contains the list of vertices adjacent to vertex `u`. The function returns `None`.

Functionality: **The function reads from standard input to construct a tree with `n` vertices and `n - 1` edges, represented as an adjacency list `u2vs`. It returns `None`.**
