Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads from standard input to construct a tree with `n` vertices and `n - 1` edges, represented as an adjacency list `u2vs`. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from vertex 0 to find a vertex `a` that is farthest from 0. Another BFS is performed starting from vertex `a` to find a vertex `b` that is farthest from `a`. The function constructs a path `path_ba` from `b` to `0` in reverse BFS order. Depending on the length of `path_ba`, it generates a list of operations `ops`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains pairs of the form `(c, i)` where `c` is the middle vertex of `path_ba` and `i` ranges from 0 to the middle index. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` where `c1` and `c2` are the two middle vertices of `path_ba` and `i` ranges from 1 to the length of `path_ba` minus the index of `c1`, with a step of 2. The function prints the number of operations in `ops` and then prints each operation in the format `c + 1 i`. Finally, the function returns `None`. **
