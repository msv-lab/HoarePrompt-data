You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2()`. The function reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3) representing the number of vertices in the tree. The following `n - 1` lines each contain two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing the edges of the tree. The function constructs a list of adjacency lists `u2vs` from the input, where `u2vs[u]` contains the list of vertices adjacent to vertex `u`.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the vertex corresponding to the list's index.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices from `b` to `0` in the reverse order of the BFS traversal path, and `n` is the index of the last vertex added to `path_ba` before the loop terminates.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: `path_ba` remains a list containing the indices of vertices from `b` to `0` in the reverse order of the BFS traversal path, `n` is the index of the last vertex added to `path_ba` before the loop terminates, `ops` is a list containing tuples where the first element is `c` and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`.
    else :
        ci2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        ci1 = ci2 - 1
        c1 = path_ba[ci1]
        c2 = path_ba[ci2]
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1` with a step of 2. `ci1` and `ci2` remain unchanged. `c1` and `c2` remain unchanged. `path_ba` remains unchanged. `n` remains unchanged.
    #State: *`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices from `b` to `0` in the reverse order of the BFS traversal path, `n` is the index of the last vertex added to `path_ba` before the loop terminates, `ops` is an empty list if the length of `path_ba` is even. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing tuples where the first element is `c` and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1` with a step of 2, where `ci1` and `ci2` remain unchanged, and `c1` and `c2` remain unchanged.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: 0 (if the length of `path_ba` is even) or `len(path_ba) // 2 + 1` (if the length of `path_ba` is odd)
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: (nothing printed if the length of `path_ba` is even, or a series of lines in the format `c + 1 i` if the length of `path_ba` is odd, where `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba` and `i` ranges from 0 to `ci` inclusive, and `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2)
    return None
    #The program returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads from standard input to construct a tree with `n` vertices and `n - 1` edges, represented as an adjacency list `u2vs`. It returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
