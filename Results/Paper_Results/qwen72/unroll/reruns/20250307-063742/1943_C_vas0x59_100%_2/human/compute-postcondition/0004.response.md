Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the vertex corresponding to the list's index. `d` is the distance (or level) of each vertex from vertex 0 as computed by the BFS algorithm, and `_` is a discarded variable.**

Explanation:
- The `bfs(0)` function call performs a Breadth-First Search starting from vertex 0.
- The result of `bfs(0)` is a tuple, where the first element is assigned to `d` and the second element is discarded (indicated by `_`).
- `d` now holds the distances (or levels) of each vertex from the starting vertex 0.
- The initial state of `u2vs` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code snippet.
