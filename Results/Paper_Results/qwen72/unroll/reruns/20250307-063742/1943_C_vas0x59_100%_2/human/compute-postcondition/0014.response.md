Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices from `b` to `0` in the reverse order of the BFS traversal path, `n` is the index of the last vertex added to `path_ba` before the loop terminates, `ops` is an empty list, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`.**
