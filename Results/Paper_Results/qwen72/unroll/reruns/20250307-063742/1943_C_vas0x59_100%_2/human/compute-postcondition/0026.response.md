To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices from `b` to `0` in the reverse order of the BFS traversal path.
- `n` is the index of the last vertex added to `path_ba` before the loop terminates.
- `ops` is an empty list if the length of `path_ba` is even.
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
  - `ops` is a list containing tuples where the first element is `c` and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive.
  - `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.
  - `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even:
  - `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1` with a step of 2.
  - `ci1` and `ci2` remain unchanged.
  - `c1` and `c2` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Length of `path_ba`**:
   - If `path_ba` is even, `ops` is an empty list.
   - If `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list of tuples.

2. **Case 1: Length of `path_ba` is Even**:
   - `ops` is an empty list.
   - The `map` function will not generate any output because there are no elements in `ops`.
   - Therefore, nothing will be printed.

3. **Case 2: Length of `path_ba` is Odd**:
   - `ops` is a list of tuples where each tuple is of the form `(c, i)`.
   - `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`.
   - `i` ranges from 0 to `ci` inclusive.
   - `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.
   - For each tuple `(c, i)` in `ops`, the `lambda` function will format the output as `f'{c + 1} {i}'`.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `path_ba` is `[5, 3, 1, 0]` (length is 4, even):
  - `ops` is an empty list.
  - Output: **(nothing printed)**

- Suppose `path_ba` is `[5, 3, 1, 0, 2]` (length is 5, odd):
  - `ci` is `5 // 2 = 2`.
  - `c` is the vertex at the middle index, which is `1` (index 2).
  - `ops` will be `[(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)]`.
  - The `map` function will generate the following strings:
    - `f'{1 + 1} {0}'` -> `2 0`
    - `f'{1 + 1} {1}'` -> `2 1`
    - `f'{1 + 1} {2}'` -> `2 2`
  - The `print` statement will output these strings separated by newlines.

### Final Output:
- If the length of `path_ba` is even, the output will be nothing.
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the output will be a series of strings of the form `c + 1 i` for each tuple `(c, i)` in `ops`.

Output: **(nothing printed if the length of `path_ba` is even, or a series of lines in the format `c + 1 i` if the length of `path_ba` is odd, where `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba` and `i` ranges from 0 to `ci` inclusive, and `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2)**
