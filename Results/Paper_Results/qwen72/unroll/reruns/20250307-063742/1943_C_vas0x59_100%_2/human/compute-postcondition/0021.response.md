Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices from `b` to `0` in the reverse order of the BFS traversal path, `n` is the index of the last vertex added to `path_ba` before the loop terminates, `ops` is an empty list, `ci2` is equal to the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, `ci1` is equal to `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, `c2` is the element at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.**
