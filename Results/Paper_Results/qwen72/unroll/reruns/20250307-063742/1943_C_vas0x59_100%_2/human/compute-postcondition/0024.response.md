Postcondition: ***`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices from `b` to `0` in the reverse order of the BFS traversal path, `n` is the index of the last vertex added to `path_ba` before the loop terminates, `ops` is an empty list if the length of `path_ba` is even. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing tuples where the first element is `c` and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1` with a step of 2, where `ci1` and `ci2` remain unchanged, and `c1` and `c2` remain unchanged.***
