Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of vertices from `b` to `0` in the reverse order of the BFS traversal path, `n` is the index of the last vertex added to `path_ba` before the loop terminates, `ops` is an empty list, `ci2` is equal to the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, `ci1` is equal to `ci2 - 1`.**

Explanation:
- `ci1` is assigned the value `ci2 - 1`.
- The value of `ci2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2.
- The values of `path_ba`, `n`, and `ops` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`.
