The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`. The loop will execute `n - 1` times, so for the loop to execute at least once, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2000, inclusive, representing the number of vertices in the tree; `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists.**
