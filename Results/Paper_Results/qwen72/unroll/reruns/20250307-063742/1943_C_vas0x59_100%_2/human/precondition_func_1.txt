No variables are passed to the function `func_2()`. The function reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3) representing the number of vertices in the tree. The following `n - 1` lines each contain two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing the edges of the tree. The function constructs a list of adjacency lists `u2vs` from the input, where `u2vs[u]` contains the list of vertices adjacent to vertex `u`.
