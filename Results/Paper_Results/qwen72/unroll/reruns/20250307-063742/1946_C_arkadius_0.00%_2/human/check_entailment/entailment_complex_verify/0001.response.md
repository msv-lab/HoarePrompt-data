### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number `x` such that after removing exactly `k` edges, each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The key is to ensure that the tree can be split into components of at least `x` vertices each by removing `k` edges.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program is structured into five functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5`.
   - `func_5` is the main function that reads input, constructs the tree, and prints the result.
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
   - `func_3` checks if a given `x` is valid by using `func_1` or `func_2`.
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are used to traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree after removing edges.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1` and `func_2`:**
     - Both functions are used to traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - `func_1` uses an iterative approach with a stack to perform a post-order traversal.
     - `func_2` uses a recursive approach to perform a post-order traversal.
     - Both functions update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
     - The logic in both functions is consistent and correct for the problem's requirements. They correctly count the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.

   - **`func_3`:**
     - This function calls `func_1` to get the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - It checks if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if it is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.
     - The logic is correct for determining if a given `x` is valid. It ensures that the tree can be split into at least `k` good components, and if exactly `k` components are formed, the remaining component must also meet the size requirement.

   - **`func_4`:**
     - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
     - It initializes `beg` to 1 and `end` to `n`.
     - It uses `func_3` to check if a given `x` is valid and adjusts the search range accordingly.
     - The binary search logic is correct for finding the maximum `x`. It efficiently narrows down the range of possible values for `x`.

   - **`func_5`:**
     - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and prints the result.
     - It reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges to remove `k`.
     - It constructs the tree by adding edges.
     - It roots the tree at vertex 0.
     - It calls `func_4` to get the maximum `x` and prints it.
     - The input handling and tree construction are correct. The tree is properly rooted, and the binary search is performed on the constructed tree.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 0 by default, as the binary search will find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is small and the tree is a simple path or a star.
   - The program also handles the case where `n` is large and the tree is more complex, as the binary search ensures efficient computation.

5. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program follows the correct approach to solve the problem.
   - The binary search ensures that the maximum `x` is found efficiently.
   - The tree traversal and component calculation are implemented correctly.
   - The input and output handling are appropriate for the problem's constraints.
   - The annotated code confirms that the state of the program is correctly managed at each step, and the functions perform their intended tasks accurately.

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided input and output examples.
