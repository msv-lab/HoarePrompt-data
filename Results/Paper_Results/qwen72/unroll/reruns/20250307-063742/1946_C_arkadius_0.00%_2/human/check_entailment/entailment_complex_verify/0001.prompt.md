You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

Both values have been updated according to the loop logic.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a Tree object `tree`, a non-negative integer `s` representing a vertex in the tree, and a non-negative integer `x` such that 0 <= x <= n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree. It updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each vertex in the tree. Specifically, for each vertex `v` in the tree, `good_components` is incremented by the `good_components` of its children and by 1 for each child whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size` of each vertex `v` is incremented by the `remaining_size` of its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.

It returns a tuple containing two values: the total number of good components found in the subtrees of vertex `v` and any additional good components formed by the remaining vertices that meet the size requirement `x`, and the size of the remaining connected component that includes vertex `v` after removing edges from its children.

Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input `tree` or any of the input parameters.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree (1 <= n <= 10^5), and an integer `k` (1 <= k < n).

The function returns this value `x`, which is the point where `beg` and `end` converge.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_5`. The function reads input values `n` and `k` from the standard input, where `n` is the number of vertices in the tree and `k` is the number of edges to be removed, such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5. It also reads `n-1` pairs of integers `u` and `v` representing the edges of the tree, where 1 <= u, v <= n.

    #State: The loop has added `n-1` edges to the `tree` object, connecting vertices as specified by the input pairs `[u, v]`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
    tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)
    print(func_4(tree, n, k))
    #This is printed: func_4(tree, n, k) (where `func_4` is a function that processes the tree with `n` vertices and `k` as parameters and returns a value)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges to be removed `k` from the standard input, along with `n-1` pairs of integers representing the edges of a tree. It constructs a tree with these vertices and edges, roots the tree, and then processes the tree by calling `func_4` with the tree, `n`, and `k` as parameters. The function prints the result of `func_4` and does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the tree has been constructed and processed, and the result of this processing has been printed to the standard output.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given a tree with `n` vertices.
   - We need to remove exactly `k` edges to maximize the minimum size `x` of the remaining connected components.
   - The goal is to find the maximum `x` such that after removing `k` edges, each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program consists of several functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5`.
   - `func_5` is the main function that reads input, constructs the tree, and prints the result.
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
   - `func_3` checks if a given `x` is valid by using `func_1` or `func_2`.
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are used to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree after removing edges.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1` and `func_2`:**
     - Both functions are used to traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - `func_1` uses an iterative approach with a stack to perform a post-order traversal.
     - `func_2` uses a recursive approach to perform a post-order traversal.
     - Both functions update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
     - The logic in both functions is consistent and correct for the problem's requirements.

   - **`func_3`:**
     - This function calls `func_1` to get the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - It checks if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if it is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.
     - The logic is correct for determining if a given `x` is valid.

   - **`func_4`:**
     - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
     - It initializes `beg` to 1 and `end` to `n`.
     - It uses `func_3` to check if a given `x` is valid and adjusts the search range accordingly.
     - The binary search logic is correct for finding the maximum `x`.

   - **`func_5`:**
     - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and prints the result.
     - It reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges to remove `k`.
     - It constructs the tree by adding edges.
     - It roots the tree at vertex 0.
     - It calls `func_4` to get the maximum `x` and prints it.
     - The input handling and tree construction are correct.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 0 by default, as the binary search will find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is small and the tree is a simple path or a star.

5. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program follows the correct approach to solve the problem.
   - The binary search ensures that the maximum `x` is found efficiently.
   - The tree traversal and component calculation are implemented correctly.
   - The input and output handling are appropriate for the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided input and output examples.

Correctness: **True**
