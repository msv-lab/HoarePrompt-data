The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, because the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`. The variable `i` will be initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, where `1 <= k < n <= 10^5`.
- `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` vertices.

The state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is initialized to 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is assigned a value such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` vertices**
