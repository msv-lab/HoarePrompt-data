The function `func_2` accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `v` representing a vertex in the tree, and a positive integer `x` representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component. It returns a tuple containing two values: the total number of good components found in the subtrees of vertex `v` and any additional good components formed by the remaining vertices that meet the size requirement `x`, and the size of the remaining connected component that includes vertex `v` after removing edges from its children. A "good component" is a connected component of the tree that has at least `x` vertices.
