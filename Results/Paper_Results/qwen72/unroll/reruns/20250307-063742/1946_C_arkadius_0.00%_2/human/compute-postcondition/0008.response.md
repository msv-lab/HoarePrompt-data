The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `tree`, `n`, `k`, and `x`. 

- `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree with `n` vertices.
- `n` is a positive integer indicating the number of vertices in the tree.
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n`.
- `x` is a positive integer.

The function returns `True` in two cases (Case_1 and Case_2), and `False` in one case (Case_3). The specific conditions for these cases are not provided, but based on the given information, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a Tree object `tree` with `n` vertices, a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k` such that `0 <= k < n`, and a positive integer `x`. It returns `True` in two possible scenarios and `False` in one scenario.**
