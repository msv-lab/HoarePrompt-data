### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to find the maximum number `x` such that after removing exactly `k` edges from a tree with `n` vertices, each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - This is a classic problem that can be solved using a combination of tree traversal and binary search.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program is structured into five functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5`.
   - `func_5` is the main function responsible for reading input, constructing the tree, and printing the result.
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
   - `func_3` checks if a given `x` is valid by using `func_1` or `func_2`.
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are used to traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1` and `func_2`:**
     - Both functions are designed to traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - `func_1` uses an iterative approach with a stack to perform a post-order traversal.
     - `func_2` uses a recursive approach to perform a post-order traversal.
     - Both functions update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
     - The logic in both functions is consistent and correct for the problem's requirements. They correctly count the number of components that are at least `x` in size and merge smaller components into the parent component.

   - **`func_3`:**
     - This function calls `func_1` to get the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - It checks if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if it is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.
     - The logic is correct for determining if a given `x` is valid. If the number of good components is greater than `k`, it means we can remove more edges to achieve the desired `x`. If it is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`, it means the current `x` is valid.

   - **`func_4`:**
     - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
     - It initializes `beg` to 1 and `end` to `n`.
     - It uses `func_3` to check if a given `x` is valid and adjusts the search range accordingly.
     - The binary search logic is correct for finding the maximum `x`. The search range is adjusted based on the validity of the current `x`, ensuring that the maximum valid `x` is found.

   - **`func_5`:**
     - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and prints the result.
     - It reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges to remove `k`.
     - It constructs the tree by adding edges.
     - It roots the tree at vertex 0.
     - It calls `func_4` to get the maximum `x` and prints it.
     - The input handling and tree construction are correct. The tree is constructed using the given edges, and the root is set to vertex 0.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 0 by default, as the binary search will find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is small and the tree is a simple path or a star.
   - The program also handles the case where `n` is large and the tree is more complex, as the binary search and tree traversal are efficient and correct.

5. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program follows the correct approach to solve the problem.
   - The binary search ensures that the maximum `x` is found efficiently.
   - The tree traversal and component calculation are implemented correctly.
   - The input and output handling are appropriate for the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided input and output examples. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` work together to solve the problem efficiently and accurately.

Final: **True**
