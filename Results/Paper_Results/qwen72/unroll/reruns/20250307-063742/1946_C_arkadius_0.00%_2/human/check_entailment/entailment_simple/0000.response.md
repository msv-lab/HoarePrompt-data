### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Initialization:**
   - The `Tree` class is used to represent the tree. Each vertex is a `TreeNode` object with attributes for edges, children, subtree size, parent, good components, and remaining size.
   - The `add_edge` method correctly adds edges to the tree, ensuring that each edge is bidirectional.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is used to root the tree at a given vertex and populate the `children` and `subtree_size` attributes. This method uses a stack to perform a non-recursive depth-first search (DFS), which is appropriate for large trees to avoid stack overflow.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function performs a post-order traversal of the tree to update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each vertex.
   - The `good_components` attribute is incremented for each child that forms a good component (i.e., a component with size at least `x`).
   - The `remaining_size` attribute is incremented for each child that does not form a good component.
   - The function returns the `good_components` and `remaining_size` of the root vertex.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function is similar to `func_1` but is recursive. It also updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each vertex.
   - The function returns the total number of good components and the size of the remaining component for the given vertex `v`.

4. **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
   - This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has a size of at least `x`.
   - It uses `func_1` to get the `good_components` and `remaining_size` of the root vertex.
   - If the number of good components is greater than `k`, it returns `True`.
   - If the number of good components is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`, it returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

5. **Function 4 (`func_4`):**
   - This function uses binary search to find the maximum value of `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and each remaining component has a size of at least `x`.
   - It calls `func_3` with the midpoint of the current range to check if the condition is met.
   - If the condition is met, it updates the lower bound (`beg`).
   - If the condition is not met, it updates the upper bound (`end`).
   - The function returns the value of `beg` (or `end`), which is the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.

6. **Function 5 (`func_5`):**
   - This function reads the input for each test case, constructs the tree, roots it, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum `x`.
   - The input is read correctly, and the tree is constructed and rooted as expected.
   - The result of `func_4` is printed for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly constructs the tree and roots it.
- The `func_1` and `func_2` functions correctly update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes.
- The `func_3` function correctly checks if the conditions for removing `k` edges are met.
- The `func_4` function correctly uses binary search to find the maximum `x`.
- The `func_5` function correctly processes each test case and prints the result.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
