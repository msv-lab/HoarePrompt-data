Functionality: ** The function `func_5` reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges to be removed `k` from the standard input, along with `n-1` pairs of integers representing the edges of a tree. It constructs a tree with these vertices and edges, roots the tree, and then processes the tree by calling `func_4` with the tree, `n`, and `k` as parameters. The function prints the result of `func_4` and does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the tree has been constructed and processed, and the result of this processing has been printed to the standard output. **
