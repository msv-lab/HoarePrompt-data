Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting**:
   - The `Tree` class and `TreeNode` class are used to construct the tree from the input edges.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` function roots the tree at vertex 0 and correctly calculates the `subtree_size` for each vertex. This is crucial for the subsequent functions to work correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function performs a non-recursive post-order traversal of the tree starting from vertex `s` (which is 0 in `func_5`).
   - It updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes for each vertex based on the size of its children's subtrees.
   - The logic for updating `good_components` and `remaining_size` is correct: it counts the number of good components (subtrees with at least `x` vertices) and the size of the remaining component (subtree with fewer than `x` vertices).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is similar to `func_1` but is recursive. It also updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
   - The function returns a tuple containing the total number of good components and the size of the remaining component for the subtree rooted at vertex `v`.
   - The logic is consistent with `func_1` and correctly counts the good components and remaining size.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
   - The conditions for returning `True` or `False` are correct: it returns `True` if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if the number of good components is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.

5. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum value of `x` such that the condition in `func_3` is satisfied.
   - The binary search is correctly implemented, and it narrows down the range of `x` until `beg` and `end` converge.
   - The function returns the maximum value of `x` that meets the condition.

6. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This function reads the input for each test case, constructs the tree, roots it, and calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum value of `x`.
   - The input handling and tree construction are correct, and the function prints the result for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`.

Correctness: **True**
