The function `func_4` accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree (1 <= n <= 10^5), and an integer `k` (1 <= k < n). It performs a binary search to find the maximum value `x` such that a certain condition (determined by `func_3`) is satisfied for `x`. The function returns this value `x`, which is the point where `beg` and `end` converge.
