The function `func_1` accepts a Tree object `tree`, a non-negative integer `s` representing a vertex in the tree, and a non-negative integer `x` such that 0 <= x <= n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree. It updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each vertex in the tree. Specifically, for each vertex `v` in the tree, `good_components` is incremented by the `good_components` of its children and by 1 for each child whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size` of each vertex `v` is incremented by the `remaining_size` of its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. The function returns the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the vertex `s` after these updates.
