Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting**:
   - The `Tree` class is responsible for constructing the tree from the input edges. Each `TreeNode` object maintains a list of edges, children, subtree size, parent, good components, and remaining size.
   - The `add_edge` method adds edges to the tree.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method roots the tree at a specified vertex using a non-recursive approach. This method correctly sets the parent and children relationships and calculates the subtree sizes for each vertex.

2. **Component Calculation**:
   - The `func_1` function performs a non-recursive post-order traversal of the tree to update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each vertex. It correctly aggregates the good components and remaining sizes from the children to the parent.
   - The `func_2` function is similar to `func_1` but uses a recursive approach. It also correctly calculates the good components and remaining sizes for each subtree.

3. **Binary Search for Maximum `x`**:
   - The `func_3` function checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices. It uses the results from `func_1` to determine this.
   - The `func_4` function performs a binary search to find the maximum value of `x` that satisfies the condition in `func_3`. The binary search is correctly implemented, and it converges to the maximum possible value of `x`.

4. **Main Function**:
   - The `func_5` function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum value of `x` for each test case. It correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

5. **Overall Program**:
   - The program processes multiple test cases as required.
   - The tree is constructed and rooted correctly.
   - The binary search in `func_4` ensures that the maximum value of `x` is found efficiently.
   - The conditions in `func_3` are correctly checked to ensure that the number of good components and the remaining size meet the requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
