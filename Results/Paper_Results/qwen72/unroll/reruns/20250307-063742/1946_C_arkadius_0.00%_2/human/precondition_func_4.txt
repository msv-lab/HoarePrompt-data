No variables are passed to the function `func_5`. The function reads input values `n` and `k` from the standard input, where `n` is the number of vertices in the tree and `k` is the number of edges to be removed, such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5. It also reads `n-1` pairs of integers `u` and `v` representing the edges of the tree, where 1 <= u, v <= n.
