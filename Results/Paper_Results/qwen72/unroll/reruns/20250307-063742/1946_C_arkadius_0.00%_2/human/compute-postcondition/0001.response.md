The code snippet creates an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` vertices and assigns it to the variable `tree`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by this code.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, where `n` is the number of vertices in the tree and `k` is the number of edges to be removed, such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5. `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` vertices.**
