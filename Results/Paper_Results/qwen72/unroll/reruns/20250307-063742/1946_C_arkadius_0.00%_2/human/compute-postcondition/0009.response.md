Functionality: ** The function `func_3` takes a Tree object `tree` with `n` vertices, a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k` such that `0 <= k < n`, and a positive integer `x`. It returns `True` if the number of good components in the tree is greater than `k` or if the number of good components is exactly `k` and the remaining size of the tree is at least `x`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input `tree` or any of the input parameters. **
