Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

1. **Class Definition Missing**: The program assumes the existence of a `Tree` class, which is not defined in the provided code. This class is crucial for the program to function as it is used to represent the tree structure and perform operations like adding edges and rooting the tree.

2. **Inconsistent Function Usage**: The `func_1` and `func_2` functions are both designed to traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree, but they are not used consistently. `func_1` is used in `func_3`, but `func_2` is not used at all. This inconsistency can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Incorrect Logic in `func_3`**: The logic in `func_3` is flawed. It checks if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if the number of good components is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`. However, the correct condition should be that the total number of edges removed (which is the number of good components minus 1) should be exactly `k`.

4. **Binary Search in `func_4`**: The binary search in `func_4` is implemented correctly, but it relies on `func_3` which has the incorrect logic as mentioned above.

5. **Input Handling in `func_5`**: The function `func_5` handles the input for a single test case correctly, but it does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement. The problem states that the first line of input contains the number of test cases `t`, and the program should process `t` test cases.

6. **Rooting the Tree**: The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is called in `func_5`, but it is not defined in the provided code. This method is essential for setting up the tree structure correctly before performing the operations.

To make the program correct, you would need to:
- Define the `Tree` class and its methods.
- Ensure consistent usage of the tree traversal functions.
- Correct the logic in `func_3` to properly check the number of edges removed.
- Handle multiple test cases in `func_5`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = []
        self.good_components = 0
        self.remaining_size = 1

class Tree:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.vertices = [TreeNode() for _ in range(n)]
        self.n = n
        self.edges = []

    def add_edge(self, u, v):
        self.vertices[u].children.append(v)
        self.vertices[v].children.append(u)
        self.edges.append((u, v))

    def root_tree_non_recursive(self, root, parent):
        stack = [(root, parent)]
        while stack:
            (v, p) = stack.pop()
            for u in self.vertices[v].children:
                if u == p:
                    continue
                stack.append((u, v))
            if p != -1:
                self.vertices[p].children.remove(v)
                self.vertices[p].children.append(v)

def func_1(tree: Tree, s: int, x: int) -> (int, int):
    stack = [(s, False)]
    while stack:
        (v, postorder) = stack.pop()
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        if postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
                if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                    tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
                else:
                    tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size
    return (tree.vertices[s].good_components, tree.vertices[s].remaining_size)

def func_3(tree: Tree, n: int, k: int, x: int) -> bool:
    (good_components, remaining_size) = func_1(tree, 0, x)
    if good_components + (1 if remaining_size >= x else 0) == k + 1:
        return True
    return False

def func_4(tree: Tree, n: int, k: int) -> int:
    beg = 1
    end = n
    while beg < end:
        mid = (beg + end + 1) // 2
        if func_3(tree, n, k, mid):
            beg = mid
        else:
            end = mid - 1
    return beg

def func_5():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        [n, k] = map(int, input().split())
        tree = Tree(n)
        for i in range(1, n):
            [u, v] = map(int, input().split())
            tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)
        tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)
        print(func_4(tree, n, k))

func_5()
```

This corrected version includes the necessary class definitions and ensures that the logic for checking the number of edges removed is correct. It also handles multiple test cases as required.
