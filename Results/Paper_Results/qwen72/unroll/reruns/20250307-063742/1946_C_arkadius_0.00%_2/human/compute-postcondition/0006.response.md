The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input values `n` and `k` from the standard input, where `n` is the number of vertices in the tree and `k` is the number of edges to be removed, with the constraints 1 <= k < n <= 10^5. It also reads `n-1` pairs of integers `u` and `v` from the standard input, representing the edges of the tree, with the constraints 1 <= u, v <= n. The function then processes these inputs to determine the result.

Functionality: **The function reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges to be removed `k` from the standard input, along with `n-1` pairs of integers representing the edges of a tree. It returns the result of processing the tree by removing `k` edges.**
