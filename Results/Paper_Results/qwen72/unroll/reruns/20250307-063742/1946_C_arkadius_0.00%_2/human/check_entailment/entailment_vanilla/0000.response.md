### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given a tree with `n` vertices.
   - We need to remove exactly `k` edges to maximize the minimum size `x` of the remaining connected components.
   - The goal is to find the maximum `x` such that after removing `k` edges, each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program consists of several functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5`.
   - `func_5` is the main function that reads input, constructs the tree, and prints the result.
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
   - `func_3` checks if a given `x` is valid by using `func_1` or `func_2`.
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are used to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree after removing edges.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1` and `func_2`:**
     - Both functions are used to traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - `func_1` uses an iterative approach with a stack to perform a post-order traversal.
     - `func_2` uses a recursive approach to perform a post-order traversal.
     - Both functions update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
     - The logic in both functions is consistent and correct for the problem's requirements.

   - **`func_3`:**
     - This function calls `func_1` to get the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - It checks if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if it is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.
     - The logic is correct for determining if a given `x` is valid.

   - **`func_4`:**
     - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
     - It initializes `beg` to 1 and `end` to `n`.
     - It uses `func_3` to check if a given `x` is valid and adjusts the search range accordingly.
     - The binary search logic is correct for finding the maximum `x`.

   - **`func_5`:**
     - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and prints the result.
     - It reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges to remove `k`.
     - It constructs the tree by adding edges.
     - It roots the tree at vertex 0.
     - It calls `func_4` to get the maximum `x` and prints it.
     - The input handling and tree construction are correct.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 0 by default, as the binary search will find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is small and the tree is a simple path or a star.

5. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program follows the correct approach to solve the problem.
   - The binary search ensures that the maximum `x` is found efficiently.
   - The tree traversal and component calculation are implemented correctly.
   - The input and output handling are appropriate for the problem's constraints.
