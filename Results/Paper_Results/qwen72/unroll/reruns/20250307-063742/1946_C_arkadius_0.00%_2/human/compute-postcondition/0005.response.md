To determine what will be printed by the `print(func_4(tree, n, k))` statement, we need to understand the state of the program and the function `func_4` based on the given precondition.

### Initial State:
1. **`tree` object**: The `tree` object has been constructed such that it contains `n-1` edges, connecting vertices as specified by the input pairs `[u, v]`. This means the `tree` is a connected graph with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges, forming a tree structure.
2. **`n`**: The number of vertices in the tree.
3. **`k`**: A value that remains unchanged.
4. **Rooting**: The tree has been rooted non-recursively with the root vertex set to 0, and the parent of the root is set to -1.

### Function `func_4(tree, n, k)`:
Without the exact implementation of `func_4`, we can only infer its behavior based on common tree operations. Typically, such a function might perform some computation on the tree, such as calculating a property of the tree or a specific vertex, or it might return a value based on the parameters `n` and `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Tree Structure**: The `tree` object is a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges, rooted at vertex 0.
2. **Function Call**: The function `func_4(tree, n, k)` is called with the `tree` object, the number of vertices `n`, and the value `k`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_4` is not provided, we can only describe the output in general terms based on the given information.

### Output:
The output will depend on the specific implementation of `func_4`. However, based on the precondition, we can say that `func_4` will process the tree with `n` vertices and `k` as parameters and return a value that is then printed.

If we assume `func_4` is a function that returns a value based on the tree structure and the parameters `n` and `k`, the output will be the result of that function.

Output: **func_4(tree, n, k) (where `func_4` is a function that processes the tree with `n` vertices and `k` as parameters and returns a value)**

If you can provide more details about the implementation of `func_4`, I can give a more precise description of the output.
