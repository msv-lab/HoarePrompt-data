Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic to solve the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_15` is intended to solve the problem, but it does not follow the problem description. The function `func_15` is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the implementation of `func_15` does not handle this condition correctly. It uses a loop and some arithmetic operations that do not align with the problem's requirements.

For example, consider the input `n = 2`, `m = 3`. The correct pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). However, the function `func_15` does not correctly count these pairs. The logic in `func_15` is flawed and does not match the problem's constraints and conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
