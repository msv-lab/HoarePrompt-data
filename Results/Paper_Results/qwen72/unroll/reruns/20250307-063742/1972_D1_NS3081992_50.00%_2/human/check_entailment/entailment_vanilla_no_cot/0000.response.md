Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function 15 (`func_15`)**:
   - The function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the function `func_15` is not correctly implementing this logic. It uses a loop that iterates while \(i \cdot i \le n + i\), which is not relevant to the problem's conditions.
   - The expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) is also not related to the problem's requirements.

2. **Function 16 (`func_16`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case.
   - Since `func_15` is incorrect, the results produced by `func_16` will also be incorrect.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. However, this can be optimized to avoid a brute-force approach.

Here is a more efficient way to solve the problem:

1. **Precompute GCDs**:
   - Precompute the GCDs for all pairs \((a, b)\) up to the maximum possible values of \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Count Valid Pairs**:
   - For each test case, count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) by checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Example of a Correct Solution:

```python
import math
import sys

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution iterates over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly. While it is not the most optimized solution, it correctly implements the logic described in the problem. For better performance, you can precompute and use more advanced number theory techniques to reduce the time complexity.
