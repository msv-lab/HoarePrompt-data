The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges (1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers up to 2 * 10^6). It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` such that `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are integers satisfying the equation `a * x + b * y = g`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the values of `x`, `y`, and `g` using the Euclidean algorithm.
