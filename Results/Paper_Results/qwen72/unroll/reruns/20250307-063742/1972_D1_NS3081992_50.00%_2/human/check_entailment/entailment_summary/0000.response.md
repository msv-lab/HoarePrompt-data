### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_15()` reads the values of `n` and `m` for each test case using `func_7()`.
   - The input handling is consistent with the problem description, where each test case contains two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Function `func_15` Logic:**
   - The function `func_15` is designed to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions given in the problem.
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly checked in the function.
   - Instead, the function calculates a sum involving integer divisions and returns a value that is not clearly related to the problem's conditions.

3. **Validation of Pairs:**
   - The function `func_15` does not explicitly check the pairs `(a, b)` to see if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The loop in `func_15` iterates over `i` and calculates \((n + i) // (i * i)\), which does not seem to correspond to the problem's requirements.

4. **Output:**
   - `func_16` prints the result of `func_15` for each test case.
   - The output format is correct, as it prints one integer per test case.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions. The loop and the calculation inside `func_15` do not align with the problem's requirements, and there is no clear mechanism to check the pairs for the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
