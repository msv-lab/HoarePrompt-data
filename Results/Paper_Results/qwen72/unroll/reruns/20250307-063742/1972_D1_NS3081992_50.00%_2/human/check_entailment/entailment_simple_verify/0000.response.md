### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not solve the given problem. Let's break down the issues and validate the assessment using the annotated version of the code:

1. **Function 15 (`func_15`)**:
   - **Problem Description**: The task is to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)
   - **Function Logic**:
     - The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
     - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
     - It enters a loop that continues while \(i \cdot i \le n + i\).
     - Inside the loop, it increments `ans` by the integer division \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\).
     - It increments `i` by 1.
     - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

2. **Analysis**:
   - The loop condition \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) and the operation \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) do not align with the problem's requirement to count pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The function `func_15` does not calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) or check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) = 0\).
   - The logic inside `func_15` is completely unrelated to the problem's constraints and conditions.

3. **Example Validation**:
   - For the input \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\), the correct pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
   - The function `func_15` does not correctly count these pairs. Instead, it performs a series of unrelated arithmetic operations and returns a value that is not based on the problem's conditions.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_15` is indeed incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.
   - The original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
