Output State: **The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of the integer divisions \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all \( i \) from 1 up to the point where \( i^2 > n + i \).**

In natural language, this means the program returns the value of `ans` minus 1, where `ans` is calculated by summing the integer divisions of \((n + i)\) by \(i^2\) for all integers \(i\) starting from 1 until the condition \(i^2 > n + i\) is no longer satisfied.
