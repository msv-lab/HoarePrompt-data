Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #The program returns an integer value entered by the user, which is likely the number of test cases t.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer value from the user and returns this integer value. The purpose of the function is to obtain an integer input, typically used to represent the number of test cases or similar count. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned integer value, which can be used in subsequent operations.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_11():

            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: `processing` is a list of integers where each element that corresponds to an integer in `d[da]` (after subtracting 1) has been temporarily set to 1 and then reset to 0, `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all integers `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0, and all other variables remain unchanged.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all integers `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0, and `rank[da - 1]` is set to `tmp + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, a list `processing` of integers, an integer `da` that is a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. It returns 1 if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one integer. Otherwise, it recursively processes each integer in `d[da]` (after subtracting 1) that has not been processed yet (i.e., `processing[di - 1]` is 0). The function updates `rank[da - 1]` to the minimum value returned by these recursive calls plus 1, and then returns this minimum value plus 1. The `processing` list is used to track which integers have been processed during the recursive calls, but it is reset to its original state before the function returns.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers up to 2 * 10^6.
def func_13(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        x = 1
        y = 0

    #State: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers up to 2 * 10^6, and b is not equal to 0.
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`. `y` is the second value returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`, `x - a // b * y` is calculated by subtracting the product of `a` divided by `b` (integer division) and `y` from `x`, and `g` is the third value returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges (1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers up to 2 * 10^6). It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` such that `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are integers satisfying the equation `a * x + b * y = g`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the values of `x`, `y`, and `g` using the Euclidean algorithm.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), m is a positive integer, and k is an integer.
def func_14(a, n, m, k):

    #State: k is an integer that has been decremented by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in range(n) where a[i] < m. The values of a, n, and m remain unchanged.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: k is an integer that has been decremented by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in range(n) where a[i] < m. The values of a, n, and m remain unchanged. k is less than 0.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It decrements `k` by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all elements a[i] in the list `a` that are less than `m` and within the first `n` elements. After processing, the function returns 1 if `k` is non-negative, otherwise it returns -1. The values of `a`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is the smallest integer such that \( i^2 > n + i \), and `ans` is the sum of the integer divisions \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all \( i \) from 1 up to the point where the loop condition fails.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of the integer divisions \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all \( i \) from 1 up to the point where \( i^2 > n + i \).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` takes no parameters and returns an integer value. It calculates the sum of the integer divisions \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all \( i \) starting from 1 up to the point where \( i^2 > n + i \), where `n` and `m` are positive integers obtained from the function `func_7` with the constraint \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \). The function then returns this sum minus 1.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: The loop prints the number 15 three times, each on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It prints the result of `func_15()` a number of times specified by the return value of `func_10()`, each on a new line. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the specified number of lines, each containing the result of `func_15()`, have been printed to the standard output.
