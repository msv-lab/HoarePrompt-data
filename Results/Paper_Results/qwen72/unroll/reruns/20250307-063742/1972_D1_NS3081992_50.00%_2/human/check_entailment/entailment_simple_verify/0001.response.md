Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. The main function `func_15` uses a loop and a condition that are not directly related to the problem's requirements. Specifically, the condition `while i * i <= n + i` and the calculation `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` do not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, they seem to be using some heuristic that may coincidentally produce correct results for some test cases but is not guaranteed to be correct for all cases. Therefore, the program is not correct for the given problem.

Final: **False**
