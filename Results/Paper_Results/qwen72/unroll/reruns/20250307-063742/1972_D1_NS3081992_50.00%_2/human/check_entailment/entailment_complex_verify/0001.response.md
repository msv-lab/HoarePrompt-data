Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_15` does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. The loop condition `while i * i <= n + i` and the calculation `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` are not aligned with the problem's requirement to find pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The function seems to use a heuristic that might produce correct results for some test cases but is not a general solution to the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in concluding that the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
