### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic to solve the given problem. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_15` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_15` is defined as follows:
     ```python
     def func_15():
         (n, m) = func_7()
         i = 1
         ans = 0
         while i * i <= n + i:
             ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
             i += 1
         return ans - 1
     ```
   - This function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
   - It initializes a variable `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It then enters a loop where it continues as long as \(i^2 \le n + i\).
   - Inside the loop, it increments `ans` by \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Flaws in `func_15`**:
   - The loop condition \(i^2 \le n + i\) and the increment operation \((n + i) // (i * i)\) do not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The problem requires checking pairs \((a, b)\) to see if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but `func_15` does not perform this check.
   - The function `func_15` is essentially counting something unrelated to the problem's constraints.

4. **Function `func_16` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_16` is defined as follows:
     ```python
     def func_16():
         for _ in range(func_10()):
             sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
     ```
   - This function reads the number of test cases \(t\) from the input.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_15` and prints the result to the standard output.

5. **Overall Program Behavior**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calls `func_15` to compute the result.
   - However, since `func_15` is incorrect, the program will produce incorrect results for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis above, the original assessment is correct. The function `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem, and thus the entire program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
