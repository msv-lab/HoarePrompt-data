To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the result of the function `func_10()`. The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a positive integer (greater than 0). The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment**
