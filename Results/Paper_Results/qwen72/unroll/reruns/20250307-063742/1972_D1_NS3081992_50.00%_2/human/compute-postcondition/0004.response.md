Functionality: ** The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It prints the result of `func_15()` a number of times specified by the return value of `func_10()`, each on a new line. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the specified number of lines, each containing the result of `func_15()`, have been printed to the standard output. **
