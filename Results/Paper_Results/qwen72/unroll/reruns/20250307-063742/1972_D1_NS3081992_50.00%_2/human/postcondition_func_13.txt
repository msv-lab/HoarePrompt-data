The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It decrements `k` by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all elements a[i] in the list `a` that are less than `m` and within the first `n` elements. After processing, the function returns 1 if `k` is non-negative, otherwise it returns -1. The values of `a`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
