Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    func_16()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads an integer from the standard input and returns it. The function does not modify any external variables or state. After the function concludes, the returned integer is the value that was read from the standard input.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads a line of input from standard input (stdin), splits the line into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not modify any external variables or state. After the function concludes, the user can iterate over the returned map object to access the integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input and returns a list of integers. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the input line has been consumed, and the function has returned a list of integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` and returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` `rows_number` times. If `rows_number` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns the next line of input from the standard input (stdin) as a bytes object, with trailing whitespace removed.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Reads a line from standard input, removes trailing whitespace, decodes it from bytes to a string, and returns this string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into separate elements based on whitespace, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a list of integers derived from the user's input.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a non-negative integer `rows` and returns a list of length `rows`, where each element in the list is the result of calling `func_7()`. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters and returns the input provided by the user. After the function concludes, the program state includes the user's input as the return value.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer value from the user and returns this integer value. The purpose of the function is to obtain an integer input, typically used to represent the number of test cases or similar count. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned integer value, which can be used in subsequent operations.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of strings, where each string is a word or number entered by the user, separated by spaces. The function reads input from the user and splits it based on spaces, resulting in a list of substrings.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, a list `processing` of integers, an integer `da` that is a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. It returns 1 if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one integer. Otherwise, it recursively processes each integer in `d[da]` (after subtracting 1) that has not been processed yet (i.e., `processing[di - 1]` is 0). The function updates `rank[da - 1]` to the minimum value returned by these recursive calls plus 1, and then returns this minimum value plus 1. The `processing` list is used to track which integers have been processed during the recursive calls, but it is reset to its original state before the function returns.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges (1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers up to 2 * 10^6). It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` such that `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are integers satisfying the equation `a * x + b * y = g`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the values of `x`, `y`, and `g` using the Euclidean algorithm.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It decrements `k` by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all elements a[i] in the list `a` that are less than `m` and within the first `n` elements. After processing, the function returns 1 if `k` is non-negative, otherwise it returns -1. The values of `a`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` takes no parameters and returns an integer value. It calculates the sum of the integer divisions \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all \( i \) starting from 1 up to the point where \( i^2 > n + i \), where `n` and `m` are positive integers obtained from the function `func_7` with the constraint \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \). The function then returns this sum minus 1.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It prints the result of `func_15()` a number of times specified by the return value of `func_10()`, each on a new line. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the specified number of lines, each containing the result of `func_15()`, have been printed to the standard output.
