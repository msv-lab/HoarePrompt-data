To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the functions `func_10()` and `func_15()` and how they affect the loop and the output.

1. **func_10()**: This function determines the number of iterations the loop will run. Since it is not provided, we assume it returns a non-negative integer.
2. **func_15()**: This function is called in each iteration of the loop and its return value is printed to the standard output.

Given the initial state:
- This function does not take any parameters.

The loop:
```python
for _ in range(func_10()):
    sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will run `func_10()` times.
- In each iteration, `func_15()` is called, and its return value is printed followed by a newline.

### Output State:
- The loop will print the return value of `func_15()` `func_10()` times, each on a new line.
- The initial state does not specify any variables, so we assume no other variables are affected by the loop.

### Final Output State:
Output State: The loop will print the return value of `func_15()` `func_10()` times, each on a new line. The initial state remains unchanged as no variables are specified.
