Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis
The program consists of several functions, but the main function that is supposed to solve the problem is `func_15`. The function `func_16` is a wrapper that reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case.

#### Function `func_15`:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

1. **Input Reading**:
   - `(n, m) = func_7()`: This reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
   - `func_7()` is defined as:
     ```python
     def func_7():
         return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
     ```
   - This function correctly reads two integers from the input.

2. **Loop and Calculation**:
   - `i = 1`: Initializes the loop variable \(i\).
   - `ans = 0`: Initializes the answer to 0.
   - `while i * i <= n + i`: This loop condition is not directly related to the problem's requirements. It seems to be a heuristic or optimization, but it does not clearly match the problem's constraints.
   - `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)`: This calculation is also not clearly related to the problem. It does not check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Return Value**:
   - `return ans - 1`: This returns the final answer, but the logic leading to this answer is not correct for the problem.

### Correctness Check
To determine if the program is correct, we need to check if it correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as described in the problem.

#### Correct Logic:
1. For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. This can be done by iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and checking the condition.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)
  - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\)
  - Expected output: 1
  - Program output: 1 (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\)
  - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), \((10, 2)\)
  - Expected output: 14
  - Program output: 14 (Correct)

However, the logic in `func_15` is not clear and does not directly implement the required condition. It seems to be using a heuristic that may coincidentally produce correct results for some test cases but is not guaranteed to be correct for all cases.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The loop and the condition used in `func_15` do not match the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
