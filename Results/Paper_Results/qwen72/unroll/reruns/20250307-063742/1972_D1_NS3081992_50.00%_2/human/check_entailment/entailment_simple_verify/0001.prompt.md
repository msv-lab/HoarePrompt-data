You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis
The program consists of several functions, but the main function that is supposed to solve the problem is `func_15`. The function `func_16` is a wrapper that reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case.

#### Function `func_15`:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

1. **Input Reading**:
   - `(n, m) = func_7()`: This reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
   - `func_7()` is defined as:
     ```python
     def func_7():
         return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
     ```
   - This function correctly reads two integers from the input.

2. **Loop and Calculation**:
   - `i = 1`: Initializes the loop variable \(i\).
   - `ans = 0`: Initializes the answer to 0.
   - `while i * i <= n + i`: This loop condition is not directly related to the problem's requirements. It seems to be a heuristic or optimization, but it does not clearly match the problem's constraints.
   - `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)`: This calculation is also not clearly related to the problem. It does not check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Return Value**:
   - `return ans - 1`: This returns the final answer, but the logic leading to this answer is not correct for the problem.

### Correctness Check
To determine if the program is correct, we need to check if it correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as described in the problem.

#### Correct Logic:
1. For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. This can be done by iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and checking the condition.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)
  - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\)
  - Expected output: 1
  - Program output: 1 (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\)
  - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), \((10, 2)\)
  - Expected output: 14
  - Program output: 14 (Correct)

However, the logic in `func_15` is not clear and does not directly implement the required condition. It seems to be using a heuristic that may coincidentally produce correct results for some test cases but is not guaranteed to be correct for all cases.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The loop and the condition used in `func_15` do not match the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
