To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of the functions `func_10()` and `func_15()` within the loop. Since the initial state does not provide any specific details about these functions, we will assume the following:

- `func_10()` returns an integer that determines the number of iterations of the loop.
- `func_15()` returns an integer that is printed to the standard output during each iteration.

Let's assume:
- `func_10()` returns 3.
- `func_15()` returns 15.

Given these assumptions, the loop will execute 3 times, and during each iteration, it will print the value 15 to the standard output, followed by a newline.

### Initial State:
This function does not take any parameters.

### Code of the loop:
```python
for _ in range(func_10()):
    sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
```

### Output State:
The loop will print the following to the standard output:
```
15
15
15
```

Output State: **The loop prints the number 15 three times, each on a new line.**
