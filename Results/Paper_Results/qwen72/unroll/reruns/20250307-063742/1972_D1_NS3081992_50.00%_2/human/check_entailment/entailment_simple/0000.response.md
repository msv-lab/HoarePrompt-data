### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using `func_10()`, which correctly reads an integer from the standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` using `func_7()`, which correctly reads a list of integers from the standard input and returns the first two elements of the list.

2. **Function `func_15`**:
   - This function is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - However, the logic inside `func_15` does not correctly implement the required condition. The loop iterates over `i` such that `i * i <= n + i`, and it increments `ans` by `(n + i) // (i * i)`. This does not correspond to the problem's requirement of counting pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_15()` for each test case. However, since `func_15` does not correctly solve the problem, the output will be incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the function `func_15` does not implement the correct logic to count the valid pairs `(a, b)` as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**False**
