### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_15()` reads the values of `n` and `m` for each test case using `func_7()`.
   - These functions correctly handle the input as described in the problem.

2. **Function `func_15()`:**
   - The function is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - However, the implementation of `func_15()` does not match the problem description. It calculates a sum of integer divisions and returns `ans - 1`, which is not related to the problem of counting valid pairs `(a, b)`.

3. **Function `func_16()`:**
   - This function iterates over the number of test cases and prints the result of `func_15()` for each test case.
   - Since `func_15()` is incorrect, the output of `func_16()` will also be incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the main function `func_15()` does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem as described. The function `func_15()` should be implementing a solution to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions, but it does not do so.

### Correctness:
**False**
