Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The function `func_15` uses a loop and a condition that do not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the loop condition `while i * i <= n + i` and the calculation `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` do not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, they seem to be using a heuristic that may produce correct results for some test cases but is not guaranteed to be correct for all cases. Therefore, the program is not solving the problem as intended.

Final: **False**
