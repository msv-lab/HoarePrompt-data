Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it determines whether the phone can send all messages without running out of charge. If the total charge consumption (considering both continuous usage and the cost of turning the phone on and off) is less than the initial charge `f`, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. The variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, and the loop does not modify the input values for each test case.**
