Functionality: ** The function reads the number of test cases `t` and, for each test case, it reads the number of messages `n`, the initial phone charge `f`, the charge consumption per unit of time `a`, the charge consumption when the phone is turned off and on sequentially `b`, and a list of moments `messages` at which messages need to be sent. It then determines whether the phone can send all messages without running out of charge. If the total charge consumption (considering both continuous usage and the cost of turning the phone on and off) is less than the initial charge `f`, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, and the input values for each test case are not modified. **
