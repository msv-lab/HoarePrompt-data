The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of messages.
  - `f`: an integer where 1 ≤ f ≤ 10^9, representing the initial phone's charge.
  - `a`: an integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, representing the charge consumption per unit of time.
  - `b`: an integer where 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, representing the charge consumption when the phone is turned off and on sequentially.
  - `messages`: a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent.

The function returns a list of results, one for each test case. Each result is the maximum number of messages that can be sent before the phone's charge is depleted, considering the charge consumption per unit of time and the additional charge consumption when the phone is turned off and on sequentially.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts the number of messages `n`, the initial phone's charge `f`, the charge consumption per unit of time `a`, the charge consumption when the phone is turned off and on sequentially `b`, and a list of moments `messages` at which messages need to be sent. It returns a list of the maximum number of messages that can be sent before the phone's charge is depleted for each test case.**
