To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `test_cases`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` is greater than 0. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to start correctly.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` is an integer equal to `t`
- Each test case consists of four integers n, f, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9
- Each test case also includes a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `test_cases` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `test_cases` must be greater than 0**
