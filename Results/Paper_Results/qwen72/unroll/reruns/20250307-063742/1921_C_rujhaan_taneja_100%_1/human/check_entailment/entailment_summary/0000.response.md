### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads and parses the input values `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It also reads and parses the list of moments `arr` at which messages need to be sent.

2. **Charge Consumption Calculation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `array2` to store the charge consumption for each message.
   - It iterates through the list of moments `arr`:
     - For the first message, it checks if the initial charge `f` is sufficient to send the message without turning the phone off and on. If `arr[0] < b / a`, it appends `arr[0] * a` to `array2`.
     - For subsequent messages, it checks if the charge consumption between two consecutive messages is less than the cost of turning the phone off and on. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, it appends `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`.

3. **Total Charge Consumption:**
   - The program calculates the total charge consumption by summing the values in `array2`.
   - It also accounts for the cost of turning the phone on and off for each message that is not included in `array2` by adding `(n - len(array2)) * b` to the total charge consumption.
   - Finally, it compares the total charge consumption with the initial charge `f` to determine if Stepan can send all messages.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'Yes' if the total charge consumption is less than the initial charge `f`.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Condition for First Message:**
  - The condition `if arr[0] < b / a` is incorrect. The phone should be able to send the first message if `f >= arr[0] * a`, not just if `arr[0] < b / a`.
- **Incorrect Condition for Subsequent Messages:**
  - The condition `elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is incorrect. The phone should be able to send a message if `f >= (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a + b`, not just if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.
- **Charge Calculation:**
  - The charge calculation for the first message and subsequent messages should consider the initial charge `f` and the charge consumption per unit of time `a` correctly.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases where the charge consumption for turning the phone on and off is very high, which could lead to incorrect results.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[-1]
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        # Initialize the remaining charge
        remaining_charge = f
        
        # Check the first message
        if arr[0] * a > f:
            print('No')
            continue
        
        # Subtract the charge for the first message
        remaining_charge -= arr[0] * a
        
        # Check subsequent messages
        for i in range(1, n):
            charge_needed = (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a
            if charge_needed > remaining_charge:
                if remaining_charge + b < charge_needed:
                    print('No')
                    break
                else:
                    remaining_charge = f - b
            remaining_charge -= charge_needed
        
        # If the loop completes without breaking, all messages can be sent
        else:
            print('Yes')
```

### Correctness:
- **False**

The original program has logical errors in the conditions used to determine if the phone can send messages. The corrected program addresses these issues and should correctly determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge.
