### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `test_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` from the input.
   - It also reads the list of moments `arr` at which messages need to be sent.

2. **Charge Consumption Calculation:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `array2` to store the charge consumption for each interval between messages.
   - For the first message, it checks if the initial charge is sufficient to send the message without turning the phone off and on. If `arr[0] < b / a`, it appends `arr[0] * a` to `array2`.
   - For subsequent messages, it checks if the interval between the current message and the previous message is less than `b / a`. If so, it appends `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`.

3. **Total Charge Consumption:**
   - The function calculates the total charge consumption for the intervals where the phone remains on.
   - It also considers the charge consumption for turning the phone off and on for intervals where the phone can be turned off to save charge.
   - The total charge consumption is calculated as `sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b`.

4. **Output:**
   - If the total charge consumption is less than the initial charge `f`, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues:
- **Variable Naming Conflict:**
  - The loop variable `i` is reused in the inner loop, which can lead to confusion and potential bugs. It would be better to use a different variable name for the inner loop.
- **Charge Consumption Calculation:**
  - The condition `if arr[0] < b / a` should be `if arr[0] * a < f` to ensure the initial charge is sufficient to send the first message.
  - The condition `elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` should be `elif (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a < b` to ensure the charge is sufficient for the interval between messages.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function does not handle the case where the phone can be turned off and on at the exact moment of sending a message, which should be considered.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[3]
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        array2 = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                if arr[0] * a < f:
                    array2.append(arr[0] * a)
            else:
                if (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a < b:
                    array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b <= f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is correct after addressing the issues mentioned.
- **False** if the program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has logical issues in the charge consumption calculation and variable naming conflicts that need to be addressed to ensure correctness.
