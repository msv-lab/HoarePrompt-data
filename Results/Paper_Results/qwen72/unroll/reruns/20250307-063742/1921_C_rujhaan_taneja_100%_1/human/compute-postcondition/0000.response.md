The value of `test_cases` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `test_cases` now holds the value of `t`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer equal to `t`, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four integers n, f, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of messages, the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially, respectively. Each test case also includes a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
