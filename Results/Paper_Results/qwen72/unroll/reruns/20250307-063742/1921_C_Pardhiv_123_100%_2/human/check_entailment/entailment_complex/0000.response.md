### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and then reads the list of moments `m`.

2. **Initialization**: The function initializes the list `ls` with an additional 0 at the beginning. This is done to handle the initial charge consumption from moment 0 to the first message moment `m_1`.

3. **Charge Consumption Calculation**: The function iterates through the list of moments `m` and updates the charge `f` by subtracting the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` and `b`. This is the correct approach because:
   - `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` calculates the charge lost if the phone remains on from the previous message moment to the current message moment.
   - `b` is the charge lost if the phone is turned off and then turned on again at the current message moment.
   - The function uses the minimum of these two values to ensure that Stepan uses the least amount of charge possible to send each message.

4. **Final Check**: After processing all messages, the function checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0. If it is, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This is the correct condition to determine if Stepan can send all messages without the charge dropping to 0 or below.

5. **Loop Control**: The function correctly decrements `t` after processing each test case and continues until all test cases are processed.

### Potential Issues:
- **Integer Overflow**: The problem statement mentions that the last test case may fail due to integer overflow. However, Python's `int` type can handle arbitrarily large integers, so this should not be an issue in this implementation.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 1 or when the initial charge `f` is very large.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages without the phone's charge dropping to 0 or below. It handles all the requirements and constraints specified in the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
