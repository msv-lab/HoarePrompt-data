Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the initial charge `f` is exactly equal to the charge required to send the first message. In such a case, the phone should be able to send the message, but the program would incorrectly output "NO" because it checks if `f > 0` after attempting to send the message, which would result in `f` being 0 or less.

Example Input:
```
1
1 3 1 5
3
```
Expected Output:
```
NO
```
However, if we modify the input slightly:
```
1
1 3 1 3
3
```
Expected Output:
```
YES
```
The program would output "NO" because it would incorrectly reduce the charge to 0 or less before checking if the message can be sent. This is a clear violation of the problem description, where the phone should be able to send the message if the charge is exactly equal to the required amount.
