### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` from the input.
   - It also reads the list of message times `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` and appends a `0` at the beginning of the list to represent the initial moment when the phone is turned on.

2. **Charge Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through each message time and calculates the charge left after each message is sent.
   - It uses the formula `f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)` to determine the charge consumption:
     - `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` represents the charge lost if the phone remains on from the previous message time to the current message time.
     - `b` represents the charge lost if the phone is turned off and then turned on at the current message time.
   - The `min` function ensures that the phone is turned off and on only if it is more efficient in terms of charge consumption.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all message times for a test case, the program checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0.
   - If `f > 0`, it prints "YES", indicating that Stepan can send all messages.
   - If `f <= 0`, it prints "NO", indicating that Stepan cannot send all messages.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the initial charge `f` is very large, as seen in the sixth test case where integer overflow is mentioned.
   - The program also handles the case where the initial charge is very small, as seen in the first test case.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program efficiently processes each test case in O(n) time, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Correctness:
Based on the reasoning above, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output correctly, and the charge calculation logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
