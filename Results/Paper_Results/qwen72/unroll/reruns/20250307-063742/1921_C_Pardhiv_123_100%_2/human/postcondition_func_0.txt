The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, followed by a list of `n` integers `m`. It then iterates through the list `m`, updating `f` by subtracting the minimum of `a * (m[i] - m[i-1])` and `b` for each element. After processing all elements in the list, it prints 'YES' if `f` is greater than 0, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function continues this process for all `t` test cases until `t` reaches 0.
