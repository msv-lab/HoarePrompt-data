### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It then reads the list of moments `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` and prepends a `0` to this list to represent the initial moment when the phone is turned on.

2. **Charge Calculation:**
   - The function iterates through each message moment from `1` to `n`.
   - For each message, it calculates the charge loss. The charge loss is the minimum of:
     - The charge consumed by keeping the phone on from the previous message moment to the current message moment: `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`.
     - The charge consumed by turning the phone off and on again: `b`.
   - It subtracts this minimum value from the current charge `f`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all messages, if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `t` is 1 or more.
   - The function handles the case where `n` is 1 or more.
   - The function correctly handles the initial charge `f` and the charge consumption rates `a` and `b`.

5. **Integer Overflow:**
   - The problem description mentions that the last test case may fail due to integer overflow. However, Python's `int` type can handle arbitrarily large integers, so this should not be an issue in this implementation.

6. **Logic:**
   - The logic of calculating the minimum charge loss for each message is correct. It ensures that Stepan minimizes the charge loss by either keeping the phone on or turning it off and on again.
   - The function correctly checks if the charge `f` is positive after processing all messages.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages without the phone's charge dropping to 0. It handles all edge cases and input constraints as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
