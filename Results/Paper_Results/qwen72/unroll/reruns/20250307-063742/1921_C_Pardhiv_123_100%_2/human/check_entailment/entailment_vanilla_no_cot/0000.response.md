Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It reads the list of message moments `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`.

2. **Charge Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a list `ls` with an extra `0` at the beginning to represent the initial moment (moment 0).
   - It iterates through each message moment and calculates the remaining charge `f` after sending each message.
   - The charge is reduced by the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` (the charge lost while the phone is on) and `b` (the charge lost by turning the phone off and on again).

3. **Decision Making**:
   - After processing all messages, if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the initial charge `f` is not sufficient to send the first message.
   - It also handles the case where turning the phone off and on is more efficient than keeping it on.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently processes each test case within the given constraints.

Given these points, the program correctly determines whether Stepan can send all messages without the phone's charge dropping to 0 or below. Therefore, the program is correct.
