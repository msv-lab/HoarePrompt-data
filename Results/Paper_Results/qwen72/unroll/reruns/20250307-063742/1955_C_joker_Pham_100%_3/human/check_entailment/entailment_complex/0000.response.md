### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`, and the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the list `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.

3. **Attack Simulation:**
   - The function uses a while loop to simulate the attacks as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `k` is zero, the loop breaks, indicating no more attacks can be made.
   - If `l` equals `r`, it checks if the remaining `k` attacks can sink the single remaining ship. If so, it increments `sunks` and breaks the loop.
   - If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, it checks if `k` is sufficient to sink both `a[l]` and `a[r]`:
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, it reduces `k` by `a[l] * 2`, reduces `a[r]` by `a[l]`, and checks if `a[r]` is now zero. If `a[r]` is zero, it increments `sunks` and moves the right pointer `r` left. It also increments `sunks` and moves the left pointer `l` right.
     - If `k` is exactly `a[l] * 2 - 1`, it increments `sunks` and breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it breaks the loop.
   - If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, it checks if `k` is sufficient to sink both `a[r]` and `a[l]`:
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, it reduces `k` by `a[r] * 2`, reduces `a[l]` by `a[r]`, and checks if `a[l]` is now zero. If `a[l]` is zero, it increments `sunks` and moves the left pointer `l` right. It also increments `sunks` and moves the right pointer `r` left.
     - If `k` is exactly `a[r] * 2`, it increments `sunks` and breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it breaks the loop.

4. **Final State:**
   - The function returns the total number of ships sunk, which is stored in `sunks`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the attack sequence by alternating between the first and last ships.
- The logic for reducing the durabilities and updating the pointers is sound.
- The program correctly handles the edge cases where `l` equals `r` and where `k` is exactly enough to sink the remaining ships.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of ships sunk accurately.
