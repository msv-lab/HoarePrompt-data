    return sunks
    #The program returns the total number of elements removed or reduced to zero, which is stored in the variable `sunks`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns the total number of elements in the list `a` that are either removed or reduced to zero. The function processes the list `a` from both ends, reducing the elements based on the value of `k` until `k` is exhausted or the list is fully processed. The final state of the program is such that the list `a` may have some elements reduced or removed, and the variable `sunks` contains the count of these elements.
