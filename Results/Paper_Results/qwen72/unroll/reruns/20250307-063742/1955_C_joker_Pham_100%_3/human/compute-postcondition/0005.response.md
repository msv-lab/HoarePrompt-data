The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`. `k` is a positive integer with a value between `1` and `10^15`. `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, each with a value between `1` and `10^9`. The function returns the total number of elements that were removed or reduced to zero, which is stored in the variable `sunks`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. It returns the total number of elements removed or reduced to zero from the list `a`.**
