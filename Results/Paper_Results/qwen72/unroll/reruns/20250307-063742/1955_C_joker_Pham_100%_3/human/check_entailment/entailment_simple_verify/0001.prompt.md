You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - The number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
     - The durability of each ship `a`.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the number of ships sunk by the Kraken.

3. **Kraken's Attack Pattern:**
   - The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship.
   - Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1.
   - If a ship's durability reaches 0, it sinks and is no longer considered in the attack pattern.
   - The Kraken stops attacking if all ships have sunk or if it has performed `k` attacks.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for simulating the Kraken's attacks and counting the number of sunk ships.
   - It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the first and last indices of the list `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of sunk ships.

3. **Attack Simulation:**
   - The program uses a while loop to simulate the attacks as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `k` is 0, the loop breaks because no more attacks can be performed.
   - If `l` equals `r`, it means there is only one ship left. If the remaining attacks `k` are greater than or equal to the durability of this ship, the ship sinks, and the loop breaks.
   - If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, the program checks if the remaining attacks `k` are enough to sink the first ship and reduce the durability of the last ship. If so, it updates `k`, `a[r]`, and the pointers `l` and `r` accordingly.
   - If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, the program checks if the remaining attacks `k` are enough to sink the last ship and reduce the durability of the first ship. If so, it updates `k`, `a[l]`, and the pointers `l` and `r` accordingly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `l` equals `r` (only one ship left).
   - It also handles the case where `k` is 0, ensuring no further attacks are performed.
   - The program correctly updates the durability of the ships and the pointers `l` and `r` to simulate the Kraken's attack pattern.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses a while loop to simulate the attacks, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The checks and updates are performed in a way that ensures the correct number of ships are sunk.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly simulates the Kraken's attack pattern and counts the number of sunk ships. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.
