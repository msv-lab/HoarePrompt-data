### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the list `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships that have sunk.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - Inside the loop, it first checks if `k` is zero. If so, it breaks out of the loop, which is correct because no more attacks can occur.
   - If `l` is equal to `r`, it means there is only one ship left. The program checks if `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of this ship. If so, the ship sinks, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the loop breaks without sinking the ship.
   - If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, it means the Kraken will attack the first ship first. The program checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`. If so, it reduces `k` by `a[l] * 2`, reduces the durability of the last ship by `a[l]`, and updates the pointers and `sunks` accordingly.
   - If `k` is exactly `a[l] * 2 - 1`, it means the Kraken will attack the first ship and then the last ship, causing the first ship to sink. The loop then breaks.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the loop breaks.
   - If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, it means the Kraken will attack the last ship first. The program checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`. If so, it reduces `k` by `a[r] * 2`, reduces the durability of the first ship by `a[r]`, and updates the pointers and `sunks` accordingly.
   - If `k` is exactly `a[r] * 2`, it means the Kraken will attack the last ship and then the first ship, causing the last ship to sink. The loop then breaks.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the loop breaks.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `l` equals `r` (only one ship left).
   - It also correctly handles the case where `k` is zero, breaking out of the loop without further attacks.

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns the total number of ships that have sunk, which is stored in the variable `sunks`.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for the problem. It handles the attacks in the specified order and updates the durabilities and pointers accordingly. The edge cases are also handled properly.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic when `l` and `r` are not equal and the Kraken attacks the ships. The program should ensure that it correctly handles the scenario where the Kraken attacks the first and last ships in alternating order until either `k` is exhausted or all ships have sunk.

### Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in how it handles the alternating attacks. Specifically, the conditions for updating `k` and the durabilities of the ships are not correctly implemented. The program should ensure that it alternates between attacking the first and last ships until `k` is exhausted or all ships have sunk.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, k, a))

def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while k > 0 and l <= r:
        if l == r:
            if k >= a[r]:
                sunks += 1
            break
        
        if a[l] <= a[r]:
            if k >= a[l]:
                k -= a[l]
                a[l] = 0
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            else:
                a[l] -= k
                k = 0
        else:
            if k >= a[r]:
                k -= a[r]
                a[r] = 0
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            else:
                a[r] -= k
                k = 0
    
    return sunks
```

This corrected version ensures that the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ships until `k` is exhausted or all ships have sunk.
