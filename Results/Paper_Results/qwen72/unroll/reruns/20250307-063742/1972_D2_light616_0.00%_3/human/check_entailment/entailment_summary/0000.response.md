### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates over `x` from 1 to the largest integer less than or equal to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - For each `x`, it iterates over `y` starting from 1, and checks if \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - If `x` and `y` are coprime (i.e., \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\)), it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
   - Finally, it prints the count `cnt`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then calls `func_1` `t` times, each time processing a new test case.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly identifies pairs \((x, y)\) such that \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) to ensure that `x` and `y` are coprime.
   - The count `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of the two possible counts, which is a valid approach to ensure that both conditions are met.
   - However, the function does not directly check if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). Instead, it relies on the coprimality condition and the constraints to indirectly ensure this.

5. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading `t` and calling `func_1` `t` times.
   - Each call to `func_1` processes a new test case independently.

6. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The approach in `func_1` is mathematically sound for the given problem. The coprimality condition and the constraints ensure that the pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) are correctly counted.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly solves the problem by counting the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case and handling multiple test cases as specified.
