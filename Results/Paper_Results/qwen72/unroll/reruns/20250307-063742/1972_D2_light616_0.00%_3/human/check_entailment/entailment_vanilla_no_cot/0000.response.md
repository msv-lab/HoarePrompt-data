Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling in `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` assumes that the input is already provided in the form of `n` and `m` when it is called. However, it reads the input directly within the function, which is not appropriate for multiple test cases. The input should be handled in `func_2` and then passed to `func_1`.

2. **Condition for GCD**:
   - The condition `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:` checks if `x` and `y` are coprime. However, the problem requires checking if `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`. This condition is not correctly implemented.

3. **Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - The program uses `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` to count valid pairs. This is incorrect because it does not properly check the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, you need to:

1. Read the number of test cases `t` and handle each test case separately.
2. For each test case, read `n` and `m`.
3. Iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.
4. Count the number of valid pairs and print the result for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

func_2()
```

This corrected version will correctly count the number of valid pairs for each test case. However, it may not be efficient enough for large values of `n` and `m` (up to `2 * 10^6`), so further optimization might be necessary for practical use.
