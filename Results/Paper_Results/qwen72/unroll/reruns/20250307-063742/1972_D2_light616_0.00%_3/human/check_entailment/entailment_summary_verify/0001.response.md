### Reasoning:

Let's break down the original assessment and the provided code to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Description:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Program Analysis:

#### Function 1: `func_1()`
1. **Initialization:**
   - `x = 1` and `cnt = 0`
   - `n, m` are read from input and converted to integers.

2. **Outer Loop:**
   - The loop runs while \(x \cdot x \le n\). This is a common optimization to reduce the number of iterations, but it is not necessary for this specific problem. The loop should run for all \(x\) from 1 to \(n\).

3. **Inner Loop:**
   - The loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - This ensures that `a` and `b` are within the valid range.

4. **GCD Check:**
   - If \(\gcd(x, y) == 1\), then \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.
   - The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\) simplifies to \(b \cdot 1\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) when \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime.
   - Therefore, \(b\) must be a multiple of \(a + b\), which is only possible if \(a + b\) divides \(b\).

5. **Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - The number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \((x, y)\) is calculated as `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
   - This is incorrect because it does not correctly count the pairs. The correct approach should be to count pairs where \(b\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

6. **Increment and Print:**
   - Increment `y` and `x` as needed.
   - Finally, print the count `cnt`.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
1. **Reading Test Cases:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t` from input.
   - For each test case, call `func_1()`.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Pair Counting:**
   - The line `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. It should count the pairs where \(b\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The correct approach would be to iterate over possible values of \(b\) and check if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Optimization:**
   - The loop `while x * x <= n` is not necessary and might miss valid pairs. The loop should run for all \(x\) from 1 to \(n\).

### Corrected Approach:
1. **Iterate Over All Possible Pairs:**
   - For each \(a\) from 1 to \(n\), iterate over each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - Check if \(\gcd(a, b) \cdot b\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - If true, increment the count.

2. **Optimization:**
   - Use a more efficient method to count pairs, possibly by precomputing values or using a sieve method.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem statement. The logic for counting pairs is flawed, and the optimization used might miss valid pairs.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
