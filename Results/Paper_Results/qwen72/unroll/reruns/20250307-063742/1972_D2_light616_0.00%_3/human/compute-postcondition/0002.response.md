Output State: **No variables are passed to the function `func_2`, `t` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The loop iterates `t` times, and during each iteration, it calls the function `func_1()`. Since `func_1()` does not modify any variables in the loop head or body, and no variables are passed to `func_2`, the state of the variables remains unchanged after the loop completes all its iterations. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
