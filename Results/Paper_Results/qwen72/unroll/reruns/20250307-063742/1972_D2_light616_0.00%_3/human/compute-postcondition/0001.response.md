The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the input integer `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly adjusted, as it will take on values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop's execution. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
