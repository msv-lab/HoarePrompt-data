Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case. This correctly handles the input format specified in the problem.

2. **Pair Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` reads `n` and `m` for each test case.
   - It uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of `x` and `y` such that `x * x <= n`.
   - For each pair `(x, y)`, it checks if `gcd(x, y) == 1` (i.e., `x` and `y` are coprime).
   - If `x` and `y` are coprime, it counts the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `a = (x + y) * x` and `b = (x + y) * y` and both `a` and `b` are within the bounds `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`.
   - The condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` is implicitly checked by the constraints on `a` and `b` and the coprimality of `x` and `y`.

3. **Output**:
   - `func_1` prints the count of valid pairs for each test case.
   - The output format matches the problem's requirement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the smallest possible values of `n` and `m` (i.e., `n = 1` and `m = 1`), as seen in the example where the output is `0`.
   - The function also correctly handles larger values of `n` and `m`, as seen in the example where the output is `5933961` for `n = 1000000` and `m = 1145141`.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The nested loops in `func_1` ensure that the function does not exceed the constraints of `n` and `m` being up to `2 * 10^6`.
   - The function uses the `math.gcd` function to check for coprimality, which is efficient.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem described.

Correctness: **True**
