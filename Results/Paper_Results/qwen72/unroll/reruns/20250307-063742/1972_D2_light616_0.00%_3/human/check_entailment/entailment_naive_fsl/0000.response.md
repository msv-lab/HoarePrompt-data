Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the input format as specified in the problem description. The problem states that the input will contain multiple test cases, with the first line specifying the number of test cases `t`. However, the function `func_1` is called for each test case inside `func_2`, but `func_1` itself does not handle the input for `n` and `m` correctly. Specifically, `func_1` reads `n` and `m` from input every time it is called, which is not the intended behavior since `func_1` should be called with the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.

Additionally, the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` as described in the problem. The condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` is not being checked correctly. The current implementation uses a different approach that does not match the problem's requirements.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
2
1 1
2 3
```
The expected output is:
```
0
1
```
However, the current implementation will read the input for the second test case inside the first call to `func_1`, leading to incorrect results.

A correct implementation should read the number of test cases `t` once, and then for each test case, read `n` and `m` and call `func_1` with these values. The function `func_1` should then correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` based on the given conditions.
