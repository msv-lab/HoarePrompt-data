### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` in `func_2`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to process the input values `n` and `m`.

2. **Constraints:**
   - The constraints \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\) are respected by the input handling in `func_1`.

3. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The program initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates over `x` from 1 to the smallest integer greater than \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - For each `x`, it iterates over `y` from 1 to the point where \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) (i.e., if `x` and `y` are coprime).
   - If they are coprime, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all valid pairs, it prints the value of `cnt`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no pairs satisfy the conditions (e.g., when \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\), the output is 0).
   - The program correctly counts pairs that satisfy the conditions, as demonstrated in the example.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses a nested loop, but the outer loop runs up to \(\sqrt{n}\), which is efficient enough given the constraints.
   - The inner loop runs until the conditions \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\) are no longer satisfied, which is also efficient.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The constraints are respected, and the output is computed as expected based on the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
