You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, and then calls the function `func_1` `t` times. After the function concludes, the program state includes the integer `t` and the effects of calling `func_1` `t` times, but no value is returned from `func_2`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Description:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

### Program Analysis:

#### Function 1: `func_1()`
1. **Initialization:**
   - `x = 1` and `cnt = 0`
   - `n, m` are read from input and converted to integers.

2. **Outer Loop:**
   - The loop runs while \(x \cdot x \le n\). This is a common optimization to reduce the number of iterations, but it might not be necessary for this specific problem.
   - For each `x`, initialize `y = 1`.

3. **Inner Loop:**
   - The loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - This ensures that `a` and `b` are within the valid range.

4. **GCD Check:**
   - If \(\gcd(x, y) == 1\), then \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.
   - The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\) simplifies to \(b \cdot 1\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) when \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime.
   - Therefore, \(b\) must be a multiple of \(a + b\), which is only possible if \(a + b\) divides \(b\).

5. **Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - The number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \((x, y)\) is calculated as `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
   - This is incorrect because it does not correctly count the pairs. The correct approach should be to count pairs where \(b\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

6. **Increment and Print:**
   - Increment `y` and `x` as needed.
   - Finally, print the count `cnt`.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
1. **Reading Test Cases:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t` from input.
   - For each test case, call `func_1()`.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Pair Counting:**
   - The line `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. It should count the pairs where \(b\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The correct approach would be to iterate over possible values of \(b\) and check if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Optimization:**
   - The loop `while x * x <= n` is not necessary and might miss valid pairs. The loop should run for all \(x\) from 1 to \(n\).

### Corrected Approach:
1. **Iterate Over All Possible Pairs:**
   - For each \(a\) from 1 to \(n\), iterate over each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - Check if \(\gcd(a, b) \cdot b\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - If true, increment the count.

2. **Optimization:**
   - Use a more efficient method to count pairs, possibly by precomputing values or using a sieve method.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem statement. The logic for counting pairs is flawed, and the optimization used might miss valid pairs.
