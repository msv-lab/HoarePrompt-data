The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the user input, where `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`. It then calculates and prints the count of coprime pairs `(x, y)` such that `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. After the function concludes, `x` is the smallest integer greater than `sqrt(n)`, and `cnt` holds the count of valid coprime pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy the given conditions.
