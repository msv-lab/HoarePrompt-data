### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The problem description specifies that the input will contain multiple test cases, with the first line specifying the number of test cases `t`.
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads `t` and calls `func_1` `t` times.
   - However, `func_1` itself reads `n` and `m` from input every time it is called. This is problematic because it will read the input for the next test case inside the current call, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.
   - The current implementation inside `func_1` uses a different approach:
     - It iterates over `x` and `y` and checks if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`.
     - It then counts pairs using `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
   - This approach does not correctly implement the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`. Instead, it seems to be counting pairs based on a different criterion, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

3. **Example Input and Output:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     2
     1 1
     2 3
     ```
   - The expected output is:
     ```
     0
     1
     ```
   - However, the current implementation will read the input for the second test case inside the first call to `func_1`, leading to incorrect results. Specifically, it will read `2 3` when it should be reading `1 1` for the first test case.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the issues identified in the input handling and the logic for counting valid pairs, the original assessment is correct. The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **False**
