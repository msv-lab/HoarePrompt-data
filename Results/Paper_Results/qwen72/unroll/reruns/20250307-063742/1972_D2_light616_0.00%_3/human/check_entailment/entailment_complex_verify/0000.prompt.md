You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: `x` is the smallest integer greater than `sqrt(n)`, `cnt` is the count of coprime pairs `(x, y)` such that `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: - The `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt`, which is the count of valid coprime pairs `(x, y)`.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, based on the given conditions, the print statement will output the count of valid coprime pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy the specified constraints.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the user input, where `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`. It then calculates and prints the count of coprime pairs `(x, y)` such that `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. After the function concludes, `x` is the smallest integer greater than `sqrt(n)`, and `cnt` holds the count of valid coprime pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy the given conditions.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`, `t` is an input integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, and then calls the function `func_1` `t` times. After the function concludes, the program state includes the integer `t` and the effects of calling `func_1` `t` times, but no value is returned from `func_2`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the input format as specified in the problem description. The problem states that the input will contain multiple test cases, with the first line specifying the number of test cases `t`. However, the function `func_1` is called for each test case inside `func_2`, but `func_1` itself does not handle the input for `n` and `m` correctly. Specifically, `func_1` reads `n` and `m` from input every time it is called, which is not the intended behavior since `func_1` should be called with the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.

Additionally, the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` as described in the problem. The condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` is not being checked correctly. The current implementation uses a different approach that does not match the problem's requirements.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
2
1 1
2 3
```
The expected output is:
```
0
1
```
However, the current implementation will read the input for the second test case inside the first call to `func_1`, leading to incorrect results.

A correct implementation should read the number of test cases `t` once, and then for each test case, read `n` and `m` and call `func_1` with these values. The function `func_1` should then correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` based on the given conditions.
