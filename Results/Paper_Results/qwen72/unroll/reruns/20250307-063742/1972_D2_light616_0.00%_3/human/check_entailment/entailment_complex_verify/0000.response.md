### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the input handling in `func_2` is not ideal. The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case. However, `func_1` reads `n` and `m` from input every time it is called, which can lead to incorrect results if the input is not properly formatted or if the input for the next test case is read prematurely.

2. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The original assessment also correctly points out that the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` as described in the problem. The condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` is not being checked. Instead, the program uses a different approach that does not match the problem's requirements.
   - The current implementation uses a loop to iterate over pairs `(x, y)` and checks if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`. If this condition is met, it adds `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` to the count `cnt`. This approach is incorrect because it does not check the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.

3. **Example Input and Output:**
   - Consider the example input provided:
     ```
     2
     1 1
     2 3
     ```
     - The expected output is:
       ```
       0
       1
       ```
     - However, the current implementation will read the input for the second test case inside the first call to `func_1`, leading to incorrect results. This is because `func_1` reads `n` and `m` from input every time it is called, which is not the intended behavior.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - A correct implementation should read the number of test cases `t` once, and then for each test case, read `n` and `m` and call `func_1` with these values. The function `func_1` should then correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` based on the given conditions.
   - The correct condition to check for each pair `(a, b)` is `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the input format and does not implement the correct logic to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` as specified in the problem description.

Final: **False**
