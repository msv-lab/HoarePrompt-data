To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is the smallest integer greater than `sqrt(n)`.
   - `cnt` is the count of coprime pairs `(x, y)` such that `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `x` is defined as the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`. This means `x = ceil(sqrt(n))`.
   - `cnt` is the number of pairs `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are coprime, and both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are satisfied.

3. **Coprime Pairs:**
   - Two integers are coprime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.
   - The pairs `(x, y)` must satisfy the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt`, which is the count of valid coprime pairs `(x, y)`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, based on the given conditions, the print statement will output the count of valid coprime pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy the specified constraints.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the count of coprime pairs (x, y) such that (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m, and x is the smallest integer greater than sqrt(n))**
