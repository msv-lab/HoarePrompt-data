### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the input handling is flawed. The function `func_1` reads `n` and `m` from input every time it is called, which is incorrect because `func_1` should be called with the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case, but `func_1` should not read `n` and `m` from input. Instead, `func_1` should take `n` and `m` as arguments.

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - The original assessment also correctly identifies that the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` as described in the problem.
   - The condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` is not being checked correctly. The current implementation uses a different approach that does not match the problem's requirements.
   - Specifically, the current implementation uses `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` which is not the correct way to count pairs that satisfy the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.

3. **Example Input and Output:**
   - For the input:
     ```
     2
     1 1
     2 3
     ```
   - The expected output is:
     ```
     0
     1
     ```
   - However, the current implementation will read the input for the second test case inside the first call to `func_1`, leading to incorrect results. This is because `func_1` reads `n` and `m` from input every time it is called, which is not the intended behavior.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program provided does not correctly handle the input format and does not implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` as specified in the problem description.

**Final: False**
