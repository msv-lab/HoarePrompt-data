Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input format correctly. According to the problem description, the first line of the input contains the number of test cases, followed by the description of each test case. However, the program directly calls `func_1()` without reading the number of test cases. This means that the program will only handle one test case, and it will not correctly process multiple test cases as required by the problem description. For example, if the input is:
```
5
2 2
3 2
10 4
13 4
7 4
```
The program will only process the first test case and ignore the rest. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
