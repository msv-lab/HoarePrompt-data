### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one using a while loop in `func_2`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to generate and print the permutation.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - `func_1` reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It uses a nested loop to fill the `permutation` list. The outer loop iterates over the range `k`, and the inner loop fills the list at positions that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i`.

3. **Filling the Permutation**:
   - The variable `curr_v` is used to keep track of the current value to be placed in the permutation, starting from 1.
   - The inner loop places `curr_v` at positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` until it exceeds the length of the permutation.
   - This ensures that each value from 1 to `n` is placed exactly once, and the permutation is a valid permutation of length `n`.

4. **K-Level Permutation Check**:
   - The program aims to construct a permutation such that the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - By placing values in a pattern that alternates between different starting points (i.e., `i, i+k, i+2k, ...`), the program ensures that the sums of these segments are balanced.
   - This approach is valid because it distributes the values evenly across the segments, ensuring that the sums do not vary significantly.

5. **Output**:
   - The permutation is printed as a space-separated string of integers.
   - The program correctly handles the output format as required by the problem statement.

### Detailed Analysis of the Permutation Construction:

- **Pattern and Distribution**:
  - The program fills the permutation in a pattern where each value from 1 to `k` is placed at positions that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i`.
  - This means that the values are distributed in a way that ensures the sums of continuous segments of length `k` are balanced.
  - For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the permutation might look like `[1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 10, 3, 7, 4, 8]`. Here, the sums of the segments are:
    - `1 + 5 + 9 + 2 = 17`
    - `5 + 9 + 2 + 6 = 22`
    - `9 + 2 + 6 + 10 = 27`
    - `2 + 6 + 10 + 3 = 21`
    - `6 + 10 + 3 + 7 = 26`
    - `10 + 3 + 7 + 4 = 24`
    - `3 + 7 + 4 + 8 = 22`
  - The maximum sum is 27 and the minimum sum is 17, which differ by 10. This does not satisfy the condition that the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

- **Correctness of the Pattern**:
  - The pattern used in the program does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
  - The pattern places values in a way that can lead to significant differences in the sums of the segments, especially as `n` and `k` increase.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the program does not always construct a k-level permutation as required by the problem statement. The pattern used to fill the permutation does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

Final: **False**
