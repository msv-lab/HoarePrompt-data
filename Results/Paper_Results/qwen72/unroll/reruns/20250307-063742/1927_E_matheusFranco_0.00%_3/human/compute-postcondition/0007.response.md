Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where the first `k` elements are filled with the values from 1 to `k` in a pattern that repeats every `k` elements, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `k + 1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.**

Explanation: The code snippet converts the list `permutation` into a string where each element of the list is converted to a string and separated by spaces. The resulting string is stored in the variable `result`. The values of `n`, `k`, `permutation`, `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` remain unchanged.
