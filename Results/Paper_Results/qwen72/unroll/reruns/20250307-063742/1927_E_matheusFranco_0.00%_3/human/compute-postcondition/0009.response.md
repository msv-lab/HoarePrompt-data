The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should be called with two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what it returns. 

Given the constraints and the lack of explicit parameters in the function signature, the functionality of the function `func_1` is not fully clear. However, if we assume the function is intended to accept `n` and `k` as parameters, the functionality would be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function is intended to accept two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. The return value of the function is not specified.**
