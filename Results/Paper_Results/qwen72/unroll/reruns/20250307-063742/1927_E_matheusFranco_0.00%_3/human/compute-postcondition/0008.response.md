Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where the first `k` elements are filled with the values from 1 to `k` in a pattern that repeats every `k` elements.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is `k + 1`.
- `result` is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `permutation`**:
   - The list `permutation` has `n` elements.
   - The first `k` elements are filled with the values from 1 to `k`.
   - This pattern repeats every `k` elements.

   For example, if `n = 8` and `k = 3`, the `permutation` list would look like:
   ```
   permutation = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]
   ```

2. **Understanding `result`**:
   - `result` is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.
   - If `permutation` is `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]`, then `result` would be:
   ```
   result = "1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2"
   ```

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The code snippet contains the statement `print(result)`.
   - This will print the string `result`.

### Final Output:
The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result`, which contains the elements of the `permutation` list separated by spaces.

Output: **"1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2" (where the elements of `permutation` are repeated in the pattern from 1 to `k` and the length of `permutation` is `n`)**

Note: The exact elements and length of `permutation` depend on the values of `n` and `k`, but the pattern is always the same: the values from 1 to `k` repeat every `k` elements.
