Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly construct a k-level permutation as required by the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the input for each test case, but it should only read the input for the permutation length and k. The number of test cases should be handled in `func_2`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The permutation construction logic in `func_1` is flawed. The program attempts to fill the permutation array by placing values at indices that are multiples of `k` plus `i`, but this does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

3. **Test Case Handling**:
   - `func_2` should handle the number of test cases and call `func_1` for each test case, but it does not correctly read the number of test cases and their corresponding inputs.

### Correct Approach:

To construct a k-level permutation, you can use a pattern that ensures the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. One such pattern is to alternate between the first half and the second half of the permutation.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def construct_k_level_permutation(n, k):
    permutation = [0] * n
    first_half = list(range(1, (n + 1) // 2 + 1))
    second_half = list(range((n + 1) // 2 + 1, n + 1))
    
    for i in range(n):
        if i % k < k // 2:
            permutation[i] = first_half.pop(0)
        else:
            permutation[i] = second_half.pop(0)
    
    return permutation

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        permutation = construct_k_level_permutation(n, k)
        result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
        print(result)
        t -= 1

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **`construct_k_level_permutation` Function**:
   - This function constructs the k-level permutation by alternating between the first half and the second half of the permutation.
   - The first half contains the first \((n + 1) // 2\) integers, and the second half contains the remaining integers.
   - The loop ensures that for each segment of length `k`, the sums of the segments differ by no more than 1.

2. **`func_2` Function**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`, constructing the permutation, and printing it.

This approach ensures that the permutation is k-level and meets the problem's requirements.
