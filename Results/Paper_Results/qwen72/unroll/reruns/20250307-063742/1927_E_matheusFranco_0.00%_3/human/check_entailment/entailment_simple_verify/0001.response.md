### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one using a while loop in `func_2`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to generate and print the permutation.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - `func_1` reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It uses a nested loop to fill the `permutation` list. The outer loop iterates over the range `k`, and the inner loop fills the list at positions that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i`.

3. **Filling the Permutation**:
   - The variable `curr_v` is used to keep track of the current value to be placed in the permutation, starting from 1.
   - The inner loop places `curr_v` at positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` until it exceeds the length of the permutation.
   - This ensures that each value from 1 to `n` is placed exactly once, and the permutation is a valid permutation of length `n`.

4. **K-Level Permutation Check**:
   - The program aims to construct a permutation such that the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - By placing values in a pattern that alternates between different starting points (i.e., `i, i+k, i+2k, ...`), the program ensures that the sums of these segments are balanced.
   - However, the original assessment does not provide a detailed explanation of why this specific pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. Let's analyze this in more detail.

5. **Detailed Analysis of K-Level Permutation**:
   - The pattern used in the program is to place values in a cyclic manner, starting from each index `i` in the range `k` and placing the next value at `i + k`, `i + 2k`, etc.
   - This pattern ensures that the values are distributed evenly across the segments of length `k`. For example, if `k = 4`, the values will be placed as follows:
     - `1` at positions `0, 4, 8, ...`
     - `2` at positions `1, 5, 9, ...`
     - `3` at positions `2, 6, 10, ...`
     - `4` at positions `3, 7, 11, ...`
   - This distribution ensures that each segment of length `k` will contain one value from each of the `k` starting points, which helps in balancing the sums.
   - Since `k` is even, the pattern will ensure that the sums of the segments are balanced, and the difference between the maximum and minimum sums will be at most 1.

6. **Output**:
   - The permutation is printed as a space-separated string of integers.
   - The program correctly handles the output format as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic to construct a k-level permutation for each test case. It ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, and it correctly handles the input and output formats. The original assessment is accurate in its reasoning and conclusion.

Final: **True**
