You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1

- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
        
    #State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where the first `k` elements are filled with the values from 1 to `k` in a pattern that repeats every `k` elements, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `k + 1`.
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
    #This is printed: "1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2" (where the elements of `permutation` are repeated in the pattern from 1 to `k` and the length of `permutation` is `n`)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, but the function assumes that `func_1` is defined and can handle the input and output for a single test case.
def func_2():

    while t > 0:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one using a while loop in `func_2`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to generate and print the permutation.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - `func_1` reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It uses a nested loop to fill the `permutation` list. The outer loop iterates over the range `k`, and the inner loop fills the list at positions that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i`.

3. **Filling the Permutation**:
   - The variable `curr_v` is used to keep track of the current value to be placed in the permutation, starting from 1.
   - The inner loop places `curr_v` at positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` until it exceeds the length of the permutation.
   - This ensures that each value from 1 to `n` is placed exactly once, and the permutation is a valid permutation of length `n`.

4. **K-Level Permutation Check**:
   - The program aims to construct a permutation such that the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - By placing values in a pattern that alternates between different starting points (i.e., `i, i+k, i+2k, ...`), the program ensures that the sums of these segments are balanced.
   - This approach is valid because it distributes the values evenly across the segments, ensuring that the sums do not vary significantly.

5. **Output**:
   - The permutation is printed as a space-separated string of integers.
   - The program correctly handles the output format as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic to construct a k-level permutation for each test case. It ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, and it correctly handles the input and output formats.
