Output State: **`t` is 0.**

Natural language description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` will be 0. The loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration until `t` is no longer greater than 0. The function `func_1` is called in each iteration, but since it does not affect the value of `t`, the only change in the output state is that `t` is reduced to 0.
