Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation for each test case. A k-level permutation is one where the sums of all continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to handle this task.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: Reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user.
   - **Permutation Construction**: The function initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros. It then fills the list in a specific pattern:
     - For each `i` in the range `[0, k)`, it fills the positions in the list that are multiples of `k` plus `i` with consecutive integers starting from 1.
   - **Output**: Prints the constructed permutation as a space-separated string.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: Reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases.
   - **Test Case Handling**: Calls `func_1` exactly `t` times to handle each test case.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Permutation Construction**: The function fills the permutation in a way that ensures the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. This is achieved by distributing the values in a repeating pattern across the list.
- **Example**:
  - For `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the function fills the permutation as follows:
    - `i = 0`: `permutation[0], permutation[4], permutation[8]` are filled with `1, 5, 9`.
    - `i = 1`: `permutation[1], permutation[5], permutation[9]` are filled with `2, 6, 10`.
    - `i = 2`: `permutation[2], permutation[6]` are filled with `3, 7`.
    - `i = 3`: `permutation[3], permutation[7]` are filled with `4, 8`.
  - The resulting permutation is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.

### Verification:
- **Sum Calculation**:
  - For `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the sums of continuous segments of length 4 are:
    - `s_1 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`
    - `s_2 = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14`
    - `s_3 = 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18`
    - `s_4 = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22`
    - `s_5 = 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26`
    - `s_6 = 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 30`
    - `s_7 = 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 34`
  - The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is `34 - 10 = 24`, which is not within the required limit of 1. Therefore, the current implementation of `func_1` does not meet the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation of `func_1` does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. Therefore, the program as a whole is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
