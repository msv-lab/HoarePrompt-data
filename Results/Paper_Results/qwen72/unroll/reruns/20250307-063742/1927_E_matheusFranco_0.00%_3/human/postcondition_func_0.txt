The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. It generates a list `permutation` of `n` elements, where the first `k` elements are filled with the values from 1 to `k` in a repeating pattern. The function then prints this list as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value, and the variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged after the function execution.
