### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one using a while loop in `func_2`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to generate and print the permutation.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - `func_1` reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It uses a nested loop to fill the `permutation` list. The outer loop iterates over the range `k`, and the inner loop fills the list at positions that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i`.

3. **Filling the Permutation**:
   - The variable `curr_v` is used to keep track of the current value to be placed in the permutation, starting from 1.
   - The inner loop places `curr_v` at positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` until it exceeds the length of the permutation.
   - This ensures that each value from 1 to `n` is placed exactly once, and the permutation is a valid permutation of length `n`.

4. **K-Level Permutation Check**:
   - The program aims to construct a permutation such that the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - By placing values in a pattern that alternates between different starting points (i.e., `i, i+k, i+2k, ...`), the program ensures that the sums of these segments are balanced.
   - This approach is valid because it distributes the values evenly across the segments, ensuring that the sums do not vary significantly.

5. **Output**:
   - The permutation is printed as a space-separated string of integers.
   - The program correctly handles the output format as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic to construct a k-level permutation for each test case. It ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, and it correctly handles the input and output formats.

Correctness: **True**
