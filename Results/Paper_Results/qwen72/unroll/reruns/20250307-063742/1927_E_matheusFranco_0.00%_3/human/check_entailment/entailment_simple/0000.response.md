Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input, reading the number of test cases `t` and then reading `n` and `k` for each test case. This is done in `func_2` where it reads `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Permutation Construction**: In `func_1`, the program attempts to construct a permutation of length `n` that is `k`-level. The approach used is to fill the permutation array in a pattern that repeats every `k` elements. This is done by iterating over `i` from 0 to `k-1` and then filling the array at positions that are multiples of `k` plus `i`.

3. **Pattern Filling**: The pattern filling logic in `func_1` is:
   - For each `i` in the range `[0, k)`, the program fills the permutation array at positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` with the values `1, 2, 3, ...` respectively.
   - This ensures that the first `k` elements of the permutation are filled with values from `1` to `k` in a specific order, and the pattern repeats for the rest of the array.

4. **Sum Calculation and Validation**: The program does not explicitly calculate the sums of continuous segments of length `k` to validate the `k`-level condition. However, the pattern used in the permutation construction ensures that the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` will differ by at most 1. This is because the values are distributed in a way that balances the sums across the segments.

5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the permutation as a space-separated string of integers.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program should handle the edge cases where `n` is equal to `k` or `k` is 2. For `k = 2`, the pattern will alternate between two values, which is a valid `k`-level permutation. For `n = k`, the permutation will be a simple sequence from `1` to `k`.

7. **Constraints**: The program adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description, ensuring that `k` is even and `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.

8. **Efficiency**: The program is efficient enough to handle the maximum constraints, as it constructs the permutation in O(n) time for each test case.

However, there is a critical issue in the permutation construction logic:

- **Incorrect Pattern**: The pattern used in the permutation construction does not always ensure that the permutation is `k`-level. Specifically, the way the values are distributed can lead to large differences in the sums of continuous segments of length `k`.

For example, consider the case `n = 10` and `k = 4`:
- The program will produce the permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
- The sums of the continuous segments of length 4 are:
  - `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`
  - `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14`
  - `3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18`
  - `4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22`
  - `5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26`
  - `6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 30`
  - `7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 34`
- The maximum sum is 34 and the minimum sum is 10, which clearly violates the `k`-level condition.

To fix this, the permutation should be constructed in a way that ensures the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` differ by at most 1. One possible correct approach is to alternate between the first half and the second half of the values from `1` to `n` to balance the sums.

Given the current implementation, the program does not always produce a valid `k`-level permutation.

Correctness: **False**
