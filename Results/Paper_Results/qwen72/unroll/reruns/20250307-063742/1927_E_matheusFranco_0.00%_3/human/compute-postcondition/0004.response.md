Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. The function then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times. After all calls to `func_1` are completed, the function does not return any value, but the state of the program is such that `t` is 0. **
