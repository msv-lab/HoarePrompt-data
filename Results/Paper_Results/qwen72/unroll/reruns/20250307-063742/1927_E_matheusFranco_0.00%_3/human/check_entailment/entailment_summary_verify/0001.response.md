### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` in `func_2` and processes each test case one by one using a while loop.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to generate and print the permutation.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - `func_1` reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - The outer loop iterates over the range `k`, and the inner loop fills the list at positions that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i`.

3. **Filling the Permutation**:
   - The variable `curr_v` is used to keep track of the current value to be placed in the permutation, starting from 1.
   - The inner loop places `curr_v` at positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` until it exceeds the length of the permutation.
   - This ensures that each value from 1 to `n` is placed exactly once, and the permutation is a valid permutation of length `n`.

4. **K-Level Permutation Check**:
   - The program aims to construct a permutation such that the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - By placing values in a pattern that alternates between different starting points (i.e., `i, i+k, i+2k, ...`), the program ensures that the sums of these segments are balanced.
   - This approach is valid because it distributes the values evenly across the segments, ensuring that the sums do not vary significantly.

5. **Output**:
   - The permutation is printed as a space-separated string of integers.
   - The program correctly handles the output format as required by the problem statement.

### Detailed Analysis of the Permutation Construction:

- **Pattern Explanation**:
  - The program fills the permutation by starting at each position `i` from 0 to `k-1` and placing values at positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...`.
  - This ensures that the values are spread out evenly across the permutation, which helps in balancing the sums of the continuous segments of length `k`.

- **Example Verification**:
  - For `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the permutation constructed is `[1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6]`.
  - The sums of the continuous segments of length 4 are:
    - `1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23`
    - `8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24`
    - `4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23`
    - `10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24`
    - `2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23`
    - `7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24`
    - `5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23`
  - The maximum sum is 24, and the minimum sum is 23, so the difference is 1, which satisfies the condition for a k-level permutation.

- **General Case**:
  - The pattern ensures that the values are placed in a way that the sums of the segments are balanced. This is because the values are distributed evenly across the permutation, and the difference between the sums of any two segments of length `k` is minimized.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic to construct a k-level permutation for each test case. It ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, and it correctly handles the input and output formats.
