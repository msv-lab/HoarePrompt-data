You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(func_2(n, a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k, n, a, and b are non-negative integers such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b) and 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a
    #The program returns the value calculated as `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, where `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are non-negative integers with the constraints 0 <= k <= min(n, b) and 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four non-negative integer parameters `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, with the constraints 0 <= k <= min(n, b) and 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. It returns a single integer value calculated as `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. After the function concludes, the input parameters `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the returned value is the result of the specified arithmetic operation.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.

    return max_profit
    #The program returns the maximum value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` for all `mid` in the range [0, min(n, b)].
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` within the range 1 to 10^9. It returns the maximum value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` for all `mid` in the range [0, min(n, b)]. The function ensures that `low` is the smallest integer such that `func_1(low, n, a, b)` is not greater than `func_1(low - 1, n, a, b)`, and `max_profit` holds the maximum profit value found in the specified range.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **`func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given value of `k` (the number of buns sold at the modified price).
   - The profit is calculated as the sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns and the usual prices for the remaining `n - k` buns.
   - The formula used is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, which correctly accounts for the decreasing prices of the first `k` buns and the constant price of the remaining buns.

2. **`func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`, which ensures that `k` is within the valid range.
   - It iteratively calculates the profit for the current `mid` value and the next `mid + 1` value.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it updates `low` to `mid + 1` to search in the higher range.
   - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1` to search in the lower range.
   - The maximum profit found during the binary search is returned.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly:
- When `k` is 0, it sells all buns at the usual price.
- When `k` is equal to `n` or `b`, it sells the buns at the modified price.
- It correctly calculates the profit for any valid `k` and finds the maximum profit using binary search.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the program works correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
