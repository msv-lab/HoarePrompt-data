Reasoning:

1. **`func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - The function correctly calculates the profit for a given value of `k` using the formula `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
   - The term `k * b` accounts for the total price of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price.
   - The term `- k * (k - 1) // 2` accounts for the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, which is the total discount applied to the modified prices.
   - The term `(n - k) * a` accounts for the total price of the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.
   - The function ensures that `k` is within the valid range `0 <= k <= min(n, b)`.

2. **`func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - The function uses binary search to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`, which ensures that `k` is within the valid range.
   - The binary search loop continues as long as `low <= high`.
   - For each `mid` value, it calculates the profit for `mid` and `mid + 1`.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it updates `low` to `mid + 1` to search in the higher range.
   - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1` to search in the lower range.
   - The maximum profit found during the binary search is stored in `max_profit` and returned at the end.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `k` is 0, the function `func_1` correctly returns `n * a`, which is the profit from selling all buns at the usual price.
   - When `k` is equal to `n` or `b`, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the profit from selling the buns at the modified price.
   - The binary search in `func_2` ensures that the optimal `k` is found, even for edge cases where `n` or `b` are very large.

4. **Performance**:
   - The binary search approach ensures that the function runs efficiently, even for large values of `n` and `b` (up to \(10^9\)).
   - The time complexity of the binary search is \(O(\log(\min(n, b)))\), which is efficient for the given constraints.

5. **Consistency with Examples**:
   - The provided examples are consistent with the logic implemented in the program.
   - For example, in the first test case with `n = 4`, `a = 4`, and `b = 5`, the optimal `k` is 1, and the profit is \(5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17\).
   - In the second test case with `n = 5`, `a = 5`, and `b = 9`, the optimal `k` is 5, and the profit is \(9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35\).
   - In the third test case with `n = 10`, `a = 10`, and `b = 5`, the optimal `k` is 0, and the profit is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns, handles all edge cases, and is efficient for the given constraints.

Final: **True**
