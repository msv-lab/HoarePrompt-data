Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct for the given problem. The program uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of \( k \) that maximizes the profit. Here's a breakdown of the functions and the logic:

### Function 1: `func_1(k, n, a, b)`
This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \). The profit is calculated as:
- \( k \times b - k \times (k - 1) // 2 \): This part calculates the profit from the first \( k \) buns sold at the modified price. The term \( k \times (k - 1) // 2 \) is the sum of the first \( k-1 \) integers, which accounts for the decreasing price of the buns.
- \( (n - k) \times a \): This part calculates the profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns sold at the usual price.

### Function 2: `func_2(n, a, b)`
This function uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit:
- It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to \( \min(n, b) \).
- It iterates using a binary search approach, calculating the profit for the middle value `mid` and the next value `mid + 1`.
- It updates the maximum profit found so far.
- If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it means increasing \( k \) might lead to a higher profit, so it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
- Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.

The binary search ensures that the program efficiently finds the optimal \( k \) within the range \( 0 \le k \le \min(n, b) \). The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when \( k = 0 \) or \( k = \min(n, b) \).

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the examples provided:

1. **Input: \( n = 4, a = 4, b = 5 \)**
   - Optimal \( k = 1 \)
   - Profit: \( 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 \)

2. **Input: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 9 \)**
   - Optimal \( k = 5 \)
   - Profit: \( 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35 \)

3. **Input: \( n = 10, a = 10, b = 5 \)**
   - Optimal \( k = 0 \)
   - Profit: \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \)

4. **Input: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 11 \)**
   - Optimal \( k = 5 \)
   - Profit: \( 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45 \)

5. **Input: \( n = 10^9, a = 10^9, b = 10^9 \)**
   - Optimal \( k = 0 \)
   - Profit: \( 10^9 \times 10^9 = 10^{18} \)

6. **Input: \( n = 10^9, a = 10^9, b = 1 \)**
   - Optimal \( k = 0 \)
   - Profit: \( 10^9 \times 10^9 = 10^{18} \)

7. **Input: \( n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000 \)**
   - Optimal \( k = 1000 \)
   - Profit: \( 1000 + 999 + 998 + \ldots + 1 = 500500 \)

The program correctly computes the maximum profit for each of these test cases, confirming its correctness.
