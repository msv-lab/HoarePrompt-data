Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns, where the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining buns are sold at the usual price. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - The formula used is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
   - This formula correctly computes the profit by summing the modified prices for the first `k` buns and the usual prices for the remaining `n - k` buns.
   - The function ensures that the input parameters remain unchanged and returns the correct profit value.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`, which are the valid ranges for `k`.
   - It iterates using a binary search to find the `mid` value and calculates the profit for `mid` and `mid + 1`.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it updates `low` to `mid + 1`, otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - The function keeps track of the maximum profit found during the search and returns it.

3. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b` and calls `func_2` to compute the maximum profit.
   - The results are printed for each test case.

The binary search approach in `func_2` is efficient and ensures that the maximum profit is found within the valid range of `k`. The profit calculation in `func_1` is also correct based on the problem description.

Given the problem constraints and the implementation of the functions, the program appears to be correct and should handle all valid inputs as described.

Correctness: **True**
