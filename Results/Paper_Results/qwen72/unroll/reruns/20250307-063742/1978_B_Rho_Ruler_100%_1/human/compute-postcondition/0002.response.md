The variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`. The loop will execute if `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Given the initial state, `low` is 0 and `high` is the minimum value between `n` and `b`. Since `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `high` will always be at least 1 (because the minimum of `n` and `b` is at least 1). Therefore, the condition `low <= high` will always be true for the first iteration, and no adjustments are needed.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum value between `n` and `b`; `max_profit` is 0**
