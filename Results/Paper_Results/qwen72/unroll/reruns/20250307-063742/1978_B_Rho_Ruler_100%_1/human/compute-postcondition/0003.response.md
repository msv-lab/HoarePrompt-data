Output State: **low is the smallest integer such that `func_1(low, n, a, b)` is not greater than `func_1(low - 1, n, a, b)`, and `max_profit` is the maximum value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` for all `mid` in the range [0, min(n, b)].**

In natural language, this means that after the loop executes, `low` will be the smallest integer where the profit does not increase when compared to the profit at the previous integer. The variable `max_profit` will hold the highest profit value found during the loop's execution, which is the maximum value of the function `func_1` evaluated at any integer between 0 and the minimum of `n` and `b`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
