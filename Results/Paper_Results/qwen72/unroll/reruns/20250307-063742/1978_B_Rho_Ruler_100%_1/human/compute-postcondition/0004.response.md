Output State: **The program returns the maximum value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` for all `mid` in the range [0, min(n, b)].** 

This means the program returns the highest result obtained from the function `func_1` when `mid` is varied across all possible integer values from 0 to the minimum of `n` and `b`, inclusive. The value of `max_profit` is determined by evaluating `func_1` at each of these points and selecting the largest outcome.
