Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Bob needs to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns.
   - The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun is `b - i + 1`.
   - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The goal is to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the total profit.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1(k, n, a, b)` calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - The formula `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` is correct:
     - `k * b` is the total price if all `k` buns were sold at `b` coins.
     - `- k * (k - 1) // 2` adjusts for the decreasing price of the first `k` buns.
     - `(n - k) * a` is the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - `func_2(n, a, b)` uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` to `0` and `min(n, b)`, respectively.
   - It iterates using a binary search, calculating the profit for the current `mid` and the next `mid + 1`.
   - It updates `max_profit` with the maximum profit found.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it moves the search to the right half (`low = mid + 1`).
   - Otherwise, it moves the search to the left half (`high = mid - 1`).
   - This ensures that the function finds the `k` that gives the maximum profit.

4. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`, and prints the result of `func_2(n, a, b)`.
   - This correctly processes multiple test cases as required by the problem.

5. **Verification**:
   - The binary search in `func_2` ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently.
   - The profit calculation in `func_1` is mathematically sound and matches the problem description.
   - The main program correctly handles the input and output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
