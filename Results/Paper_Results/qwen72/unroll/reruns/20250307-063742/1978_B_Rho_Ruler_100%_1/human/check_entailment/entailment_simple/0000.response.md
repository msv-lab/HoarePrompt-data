### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Bob can sell `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - Bob can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
   - The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - The formula used is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
   - `k * b` is the total price of the first `k` buns if they were all sold at `b` coins each.
   - `k * (k - 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, which is subtracted to account for the decreasing price of the first `k` buns.
   - `(n - k) * a` is the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price `a`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - `low` and `high` are initialized to `0` and `min(n, b)` respectively, which are the valid range for `k`.
   - The binary search iterates, calculating the profit for the current `mid` and the next `mid + 1`.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it means the optimal `k` is likely greater than `mid`, so `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
   - The maximum profit found during the search is stored in `max_profit` and returned.

4. **Binary Search Validity**:
   - The binary search is appropriate here because the profit function is unimodal (it increases to a peak and then decreases).
   - The search ensures that the maximum profit is found by comparing the profit at the current midpoint and the next midpoint.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `k = 0`, all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - When `k = min(n, b)`, the first `k` buns are sold at the modified price, and the remaining buns are sold at `a`.
   - The program handles these cases correctly by the binary search mechanism.

6. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - The program correctly calculates the profit for each possible `k` and finds the maximum profit.
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently, even for large values of `n` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and efficiently finds the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns using the given promotion strategy.
