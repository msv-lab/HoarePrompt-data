Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **`func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given value of `k` (the number of buns sold at the modified price).
   - The profit is calculated as the sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns and the usual prices for the remaining `n - k` buns.
   - The formula used is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, which correctly accounts for the decreasing prices of the first `k` buns and the constant price of the remaining buns.

2. **`func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`, which ensures that `k` is within the valid range.
   - It iteratively calculates the profit for the current `mid` value and the next `mid + 1` value.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it updates `low` to `mid + 1` to search in the higher range.
   - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1` to search in the lower range.
   - The maximum profit found during the binary search is returned.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly:
- When `k` is 0, it sells all buns at the usual price.
- When `k` is equal to `n` or `b`, it sells the buns at the modified price.
- It correctly calculates the profit for any valid `k` and finds the maximum profit using binary search.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the program works correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
