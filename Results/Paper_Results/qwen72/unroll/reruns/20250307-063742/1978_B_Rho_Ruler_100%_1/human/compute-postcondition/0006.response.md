Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` within the range 1 to 10^9. It returns the maximum value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` for all `mid` in the range [0, min(n, b)]. The function ensures that `low` is the smallest integer such that `func_1(low, n, a, b)` is not greater than `func_1(low - 1, n, a, b)`, and `max_profit` holds the maximum profit value found in the specified range. **
