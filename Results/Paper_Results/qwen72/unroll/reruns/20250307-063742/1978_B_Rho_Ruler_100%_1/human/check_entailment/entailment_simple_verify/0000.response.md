Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all his buns under the given promotion rules. Let's break down the reasoning and validate the original assessment step by step.

### Function 1: `func_1(k, n, a, b)`
- **Purpose**: Calculate the profit for a given value of `k`.
- **Formula**: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`
  - `k * b` is the total price of the first `k` buns if they were all sold at the initial modified price `b`.
  - `k * (k - 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, which represents the total discount applied to the first `k` buns due to the decreasing price.
  - `(n - k) * a` is the total price of the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a`.
- **Correctness**: The formula correctly accounts for the modified and usual prices, ensuring that the profit is calculated accurately for any valid `k`.

### Function 2: `func_2(n, a, b)`
- **Purpose**: Find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit using binary search.
- **Initialization**:
  - `low` is set to 0.
  - `high` is set to `min(n, b)`, ensuring `k` is within the valid range.
- **Binary Search**:
  - The loop continues while `low <= high`.
  - `mid` is calculated as the midpoint of `low` and `high`.
  - `profit_mid` is the profit for `k = mid`.
  - `profit_next` is the profit for `k = mid + 1`.
  - If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, it means the profit is still increasing, so `low` is updated to `mid + 1` to search in the higher range.
  - Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` to search in the lower range.
  - The maximum profit found during the search is stored in `max_profit`.
- **Termination**:
  - The loop terminates when `low` exceeds `high`, ensuring all possible values of `k` have been considered.
  - The function returns `max_profit`, which is the maximum profit found.

### Annotated Code
- **State Before `func_1` Call**: `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are non-negative integers with the constraints `0 <= k <= min(n, b)` and `1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9`.
- **State Before `func_2` Call**: `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers with the constraints `1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9`.
- **State After Binary Search**: `low` is the smallest integer such that `func_1(low, n, a, b)` is not greater than `func_1(low - 1, n, a, b)`, and `max_profit` is the maximum value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` for all `mid` in the range `[0, min(n, b)]`.

### Edge Cases
- **When `k` is 0**: The program correctly sells all buns at the usual price `a`.
- **When `k` is equal to `n` or `b`**: The program correctly sells the buns at the modified price, ensuring the maximum profit is calculated.
- **General Case**: The binary search ensures that the program efficiently finds the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.

### Example Verification
- **Example 1**: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
  - Optimal `k` is 1.
  - Profit: `1 * 5 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`.
- **Example 2**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Optimal `k` is 5.
  - Profit: `5 * 9 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45 - 10 = 35`.
- **Example 3**: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
  - Optimal `k` is 0.
  - Profit: `0 * 5 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (10 - 0) * 10 = 100`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all his buns. The binary search efficiently finds the optimal value of `k`, and the profit calculation formula is accurate for all valid inputs.

Final: **True**
