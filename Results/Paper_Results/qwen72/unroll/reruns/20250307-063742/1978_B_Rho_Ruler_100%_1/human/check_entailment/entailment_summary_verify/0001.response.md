### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires Bob to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns, where the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The modified price for the `i`-th bun is `b - i + 1` coins, and the usual price is `a` coins.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**
   - This function calculates the total profit for a given `k`.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.
   - The formula `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2` correctly calculates the sum of the modified prices, which is a decreasing arithmetic series.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(n, a, b)`**
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - The binary search range is from `0` to `min(n, b)`, which is the valid range for `k`.
   - For each midpoint `mid`, it calculates the profit using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and the profit for the next value `mid + 1` using `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it means the optimal `k` is in the upper half, so it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - The function keeps track of the maximum profit found during the search and returns it.

4. **Binary Search Justification:**
   - The profit function is unimodal, meaning it increases to a peak and then decreases.
   - By comparing the profit at `mid` and `mid + 1`, the algorithm can efficiently narrow down the search range to find the maximum profit.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `k = 0`, all buns are sold at the usual price `a`, which is correctly handled by the formula.
   - When `k = n` and `n <= b`, all buns are sold at the modified price, which is also correctly handled.
   - The function handles large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` (up to \(10^9\)) efficiently due to the binary search.

6. **Function Summary Verification:**
   - The function summary for `func_2` states that it returns the maximum value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` for all `mid` in the range `[0, min(n, b)]`.
   - The function ensures that `low` is the smallest integer such that `func_1(low, n, a, b)` is not greater than `func_1(low - 1, n, a, b)`.
   - This aligns with the binary search approach described in the original assessment.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit, and the profit calculation in `func_1` is correct and matches the problem description. The program efficiently handles the constraints and edge cases.

Final: **True**
