### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by reading a binary string \( s \) and calling `func_1(s)` to compute the minimum cost.

2. **Function `func_1(sChar)`**:
   - The function converts the string \( sChar \) into a list \( s \) for easier manipulation. This is a valid approach.
   - It initializes `left` and `right` pointers and `cost` to 0. This is correct.

3. **Cyclic Shift Logic**:
   - The program checks if `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1'. If so, it swaps them and increments the cost by the length of the substring \( r - l + 1 \).
   - This logic ensures that '1's are moved to the left and '0's to the right, which is correct for sorting the string in non-descending order.

4. **Pointer Movement**:
   - After a swap, the program moves the `right` pointer to the next '0' and the `left` pointer to the next '1'.
   - This ensures that the next potential swap is considered correctly and prevents the program from getting stuck in an infinite loop.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by not performing any swaps and returning a cost of 0.
   - It also handles the case where the string is not sorted and requires multiple swaps.

6. **Verification with Test Cases**:
   - **Test Case: "10"**
     - Initial: `s = ['1', '0']`
     - Swap: `s = ['0', '1']`
     - Cost: 2
     - Output: 2 (Correct)
   - **Test Case: "0000"**
     - Initial: `s = ['0', '0', '0', '0']`
     - No swaps needed
     - Cost: 0
     - Output: 0 (Correct)
   - **Test Case: "11000"**
     - Initial: `s = ['1', '1', '0', '0', '0']`
     - Swap 1: `s = ['0', '1', '1', '0', '0']` (Cost: 3)
     - Swap 2: `s = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '0']` (Cost: 3)
     - Swap 3: `s = ['0', '0', '0', '1', '1']` (Cost: 3)
     - Total Cost: 9
     - Output: 9 (Correct)
   - **Test Case: "101011"**
     - Initial: `s = ['1', '0', '1', '0', '1', '1']`
     - Swap 1: `s = ['0', '1', '1', '0', '1', '1']` (Cost: 2)
     - Swap 2: `s = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '1']` (Cost: 3)
     - Total Cost: 5
     - Output: 5 (Correct)
   - **Test Case: "01101001"**
     - Initial: `s = ['0', '1', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1']`
     - Swap 1: `s = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '1']` (Cost: 4)
     - Swap 2: `s = ['0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '0', '1']` (Cost: 4)
     - Swap 3: `s = ['0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '1']` (Cost: 3)
     - Total Cost: 11
     - Output: 11 (Correct)

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts and calculates the minimum total cost. It handles all the provided test cases correctly and should work for other valid inputs as well.

Final: **True**
