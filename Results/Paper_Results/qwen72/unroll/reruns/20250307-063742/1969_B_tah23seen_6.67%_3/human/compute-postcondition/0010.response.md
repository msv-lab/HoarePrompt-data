Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a binary string `sChar` and returns the total number of swaps performed to move all '1's to the left and all '0's to the right within the string. The final state of the program is that the input string is transformed into a list `s` where all '1's are at the beginning and all '0's are at the end, and the variable `cost` holds the total number of swaps required to achieve this transformation. **
