### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading a binary string `s` and calling `func_1(s)`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function converts the binary string `sChar` into a list `s` to facilitate character manipulation.
   - It initializes `left` and `right` pointers to 0 and 1, respectively, and a `cost` variable to 0 to keep track of the total cost of operations.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right` and `right` is within the bounds of the string.
   - The condition `if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1'` checks if a '0' is found to the right of a '1', indicating a potential swap to sort the string.
   - If this condition is met, the characters at `left` and `right` are swapped, and the cost is incremented by the length of the substring being shifted (`right - left + 1`).

4. **Pointer Movement:**
   - After a swap, the `right` pointer is moved to the next '0' in the string, and the `left` pointer is moved to the next '1' in the string.
   - This ensures that the next potential swap is considered, and the loop continues until all '0's are moved to the right of all '1's.

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns the total cost of the operations performed, which is stored in the `cost` variable.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies and swaps out-of-order '0's and '1's to sort the string.
- The cost calculation is accurate, as it sums the lengths of the substrings being cyclically shifted.
- The loop and pointer movements ensure that all necessary swaps are performed and the string is sorted in non-descending order.

### Edge Cases:
- **Already Sorted String:**
  - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the program will not perform any swaps, and the cost will be 0, which is correct.
- **String with All '0's or All '1's:**
  - If the string consists entirely of '0's or '1's, the program will also not perform any swaps, and the cost will be 0, which is correct.
- **String with a Single '1' or '0':**
  - If the string has only one '1' or '0', the program will not perform any swaps, and the cost will be 0, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and performs the necessary operations to sort the binary string with the minimum total cost.
