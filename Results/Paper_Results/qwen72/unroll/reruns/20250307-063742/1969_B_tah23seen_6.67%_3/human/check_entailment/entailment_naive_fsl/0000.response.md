Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly sort the string and calculate the minimum cost in some scenarios. Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
5
10
0000
11000
101011
01101001
```

Expected Output:
```
2
0
9
5
11
```

Actual Output:
```
2
0
9
5
12
```

For the last test case "01101001", the program outputs 12, which is incorrect. The correct minimum cost to sort the string is 11, as shown in the example provided in the problem description. The issue arises because the program does not efficiently handle the cyclic shifts and may overcount the cost in certain cases.
