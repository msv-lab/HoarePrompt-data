The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sChar`. `sChar` is a binary string, which means it consists only of '0's and '1's, and its length is between 2 and 200,000 characters. The function returns the total number of swaps performed, which is the value of the variable `cost`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string `sChar` and returns the total number of swaps performed, represented by the variable `cost`.**
