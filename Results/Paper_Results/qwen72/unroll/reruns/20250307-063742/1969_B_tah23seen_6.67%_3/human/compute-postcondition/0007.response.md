Output State: **`s` is a list with all '1's moved to the left and all '0's moved to the right, `left` is the index of the first '0' in the list (or equal to `len(s)` if there are no '0's), `right` is the index of the last '1' in the list (or equal to `len(s)` if there are no '1's), and `cost` is the total number of swaps performed.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates through the list `s` and swaps '1's and '0's such that all '1's are moved to the left and all '0's are moved to the right.
- The variable `left` is used to find the next '1' in the list, and `right` is used to find the next '0' in the list.
- Each time a swap is performed, the `cost` is incremented by the distance between `right` and `left` plus one.
- After the loop finishes, `left` will be the index of the first '0' in the list (or equal to `len(s)` if there are no '0's), and `right` will be the index of the last '1' in the list (or equal to `len(s)` if there are no '1's).
