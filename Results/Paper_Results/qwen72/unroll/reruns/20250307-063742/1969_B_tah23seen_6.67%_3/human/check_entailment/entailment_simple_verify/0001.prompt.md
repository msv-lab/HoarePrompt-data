You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Cyclic Shift Definition**: A cyclic shift of a substring \( s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r \) transforms it to \( s_r s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_{r-1} \).
2. **Objective**: Minimize the total cost of cyclic shifts to sort the binary string in non-descending order.
3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the chosen substring, \( r - l + 1 \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string \( s \) and calls `func_1(s)` to compute the minimum cost.

2. **Function `func_1(sChar)`**:
   - Converts the string \( sChar \) into a list \( s \) for easier manipulation.
   - Initializes `left` and `right` pointers and `cost` to 0.
   - Uses a while loop to iterate through the string and perform cyclic shifts.

3. **Cyclic Shift Logic**:
   - The while loop continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right` and both are within the bounds of the string.
   - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', it swaps them and increments the cost by the length of the substring \( r - l + 1 \).
   - Moves the `right` pointer to the next '0' and the `left` pointer to the next '1'.

### Issues and Considerations:
1. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program swaps `s[right]` and `s[left]` when `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1'.
   - This logic ensures that '1's are moved to the left and '0's to the right, which is correct for sorting the string in non-descending order.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost is incremented by \( r - l + 1 \) each time a swap is performed.
   - This is the correct way to calculate the cost of a cyclic shift.

3. **Pointer Movement**:
   - The `right` pointer is moved to the next '0' and the `left` pointer to the next '1' after a swap.
   - This ensures that the next potential swap is considered correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by not performing any swaps and returning a cost of 0.
   - It also handles the case where the string is not sorted and requires multiple swaps.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Infinite Loop**:
   - The condition `left <= right` in the while loop might cause an infinite loop if `left` and `right` are not properly updated.
   - However, the program updates `left` and `right` to the next '1' and '0' respectively, which should prevent this issue.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - The program might not be the most efficient, but it should work within the given constraints (sum of lengths of strings over all test cases doesn't exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \)).

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case: "10"**
   - Initial: `s = ['1', '0']`
   - Swap: `s = ['0', '1']`
   - Cost: 2
   - Output: 2 (Correct)

2. **Test Case: "0000"**
   - Initial: `s = ['0', '0', '0', '0']`
   - No swaps needed
   - Cost: 0
   - Output: 0 (Correct)

3. **Test Case: "11000"**
   - Initial: `s = ['1', '1', '0', '0', '0']`
   - Swap 1: `s = ['0', '1', '1', '0', '0']` (Cost: 3)
   - Swap 2: `s = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '0']` (Cost: 3)
   - Swap 3: `s = ['0', '0', '0', '1', '1']` (Cost: 3)
   - Total Cost: 9
   - Output: 9 (Correct)

4. **Test Case: "101011"**
   - Initial: `s = ['1', '0', '1', '0', '1', '1']`
   - Swap 1: `s = ['0', '1', '1', '0', '1', '1']` (Cost: 2)
   - Swap 2: `s = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '1']` (Cost: 3)
   - Total Cost: 5
   - Output: 5 (Correct)

5. **Test Case: "01101001"**
   - Initial: `s = ['0', '1', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1']`
   - Swap 1: `s = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '1']` (Cost: 4)
   - Swap 2: `s = ['0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '0', '1']` (Cost: 4)
   - Swap 3: `s = ['0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '1']` (Cost: 3)
   - Total Cost: 11
   - Output: 11 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts and calculates the minimum total cost. It handles all the provided test cases correctly and should work for other valid inputs as well.
