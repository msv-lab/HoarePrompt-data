### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the original assessment step by step.

#### Problem Description:
The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the chosen substring.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and calls the function `func_1(s)`.

2. **Function `func_1(sChar)`:**
   - Converts the binary string `sChar` into a list `s` of characters.
   - Initializes `left` to 0, `cost` to 0, and `right` to 1.
   - The main loop runs while `left <= right`, `right < len(s)`, and `left < len(s)`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', it swaps these characters and increments the cost by the length of the substring from `left` to `right` (inclusive).
   - It then advances `right` to the next '0' and `left` to the next '1'.

4. **Final State:**
   - The function returns the total cost of the swaps performed.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `sChar` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200,000.
- **State After List Conversion:**
  - `s` is a list of characters from `sChar`.
- **State After Main Loop:**
  - `s` is supposed to be a list with all '1's moved to the left and all '0's moved to the right.
  - `left` is the index of the first '0' in the list (or `len(s)` if there are no '0's).
  - `right` is the index of the last '1' in the list (or `len(s)` if there are no '1's).
  - `cost` is the total number of swaps performed.

#### Counterexample Analysis:
For the test case "01101001":
- The program should output 11, but it outputs 12.

Let's trace the program for this test case:
- Initial `s` list: `['0', '1', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1']`
- `left` starts at 0, `right` starts at 1.

1. **First Iteration:**
   - `s[1] == '1'` and `s[0] == '0'` (no swap needed).
   - `right` is incremented to 2.
   - `s[2] == '1'` and `s[0] == '0'` (no swap needed).
   - `right` is incremented to 3.
   - `s[3] == '0'` and `s[0] == '0'` (no swap needed).
   - `right` is incremented to 4.
   - `s[4] == '1'` and `s[0] == '0'` (no swap needed).
   - `right` is incremented to 5.
   - `s[5] == '0'` and `s[0] == '0'` (no swap needed).
   - `right` is incremented to 6.
   - `s[6] == '0'` and `s[0] == '0'` (no swap needed).
   - `right` is incremented to 7.
   - `s[7] == '1'` and `s[0] == '0'` (no swap needed).
   - `right` is incremented to 8 (out of bounds).

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - `left` is incremented to 1.
   - `s[1] == '1'` and `s[1] == '1'` (no swap needed).
   - `left` is incremented to 2.
   - `s[2] == '1'` and `s[2] == '1'` (no swap needed).
   - `left` is incremented to 3.
   - `s[3] == '0'` and `s[3] == '0'` (no swap needed).
   - `left` is incremented to 4.
   - `s[4] == '1'` and `s[4] == '1'` (no swap needed).
   - `left` is incremented to 5.
   - `s[5] == '0'` and `s[5] == '0'` (no swap needed).
   - `left` is incremented to 6.
   - `s[6] == '0'` and `s[6] == '0'` (no swap needed).
   - `left` is incremented to 7.
   - `s[7] == '1'` and `s[7] == '1'` (no swap needed).
   - `left` is incremented to 8 (out of bounds).

The program does not perform any swaps in this case, which is incorrect. The correct approach should involve identifying the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Identify the number of '1's and '0's in the string.
- Determine the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to move all '1's to the front and all '0's to the back.

The correct minimum cost can be calculated by:
- Finding the number of '1's in the string.
- Finding the number of '0's in the string.
- Calculating the minimum cost as the minimum of the sum of the lengths of the substrings that need to be cyclically shifted.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the cyclic shifts efficiently and may overcount the cost in certain cases. The counterexample provided in the original assessment is valid.

Final: **False**
