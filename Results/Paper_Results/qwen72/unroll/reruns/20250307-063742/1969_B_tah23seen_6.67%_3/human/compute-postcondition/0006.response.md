To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

1. `left <= right`
2. `right < len(s)`
3. `left < len(s)`

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a list containing each character of the binary string `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`.
- `left` is 0.
- `cost` is 0.
- `right` is 1.

Let's evaluate each condition:

1. `left <= right`: Since `left` is 0 and `right` is 1, this condition is already satisfied.
2. `right < len(s)`: For this condition to be satisfied, `right` must be less than the length of `s`. Since `right` is 1, `len(s)` must be greater than 1.
3. `left < len(s)`: For this condition to be satisfied, `left` must be less than the length of `s`. Since `left` is 0, `len(s)` must be greater than 0.

Since `left` is 0 and `right` is 1, both `left` and `right` are already in a state that satisfies the first two conditions. The only condition that needs to be ensured is that `len(s)` is greater than 1. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `s` has at least 2 elements.

State: **`s` is a list containing each character of the binary string `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar` and `len(s)` must be greater than 1, `left` is 0, `cost` is 0, `right` is 1**
