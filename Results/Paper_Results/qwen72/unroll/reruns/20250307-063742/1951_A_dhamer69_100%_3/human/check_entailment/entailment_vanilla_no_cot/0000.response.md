Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. The program defines a function `func()` that processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the input, and then checks if the string `s` meets certain conditions to print 'YES' or 'NO'. The conditions are:

1. If `n` is 2, the program checks if the string `s` is '00'. If it is, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
2. If `n` is greater than 2, it counts the number of '1's in the string `s`:
   - If the count of '1's is odd, it prints 'NO'.
   - If the count of '1's is exactly 2 and the substring '11' appears exactly once, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The program correctly handles the input and output as described, and the logic for determining 'YES' or 'NO' is implemented according to the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
