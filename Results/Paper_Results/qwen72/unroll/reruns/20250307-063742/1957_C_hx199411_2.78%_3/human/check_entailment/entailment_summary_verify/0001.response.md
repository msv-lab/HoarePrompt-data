### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played.
   - It then reads \( k \) moves, each consisting of two integers \( r_i \) and \( c_i \).

2. **Counting Used Rows and Columns**:
   - The program initializes a variable `num` to 0.
   - For each move, it checks if \( r_i == c_i \). If true, it increments `num` by 1 (since the computer skips its turn). If false, it increments `num` by 2 (since both your move and the computer's move occupy a row and a column).
   - This logic is correct because:
     - If \( r_i == c_i \), only one position is used, and the computer skips its turn.
     - If \( r_i \neq c_i \), two positions are used, one for your move and one for the computer's move.

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions**:
   - The program calculates \( m = n - num \), which represents the number of remaining positions that can be used for placing rooks.
   - This calculation is correct as it accurately reflects the number of positions left after considering the \( k \) moves and their implications.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations**:
   - If \( m = 0 \), there are no valid moves left, so the program prints 0.
   - If \( m = 1 \), there is only one position left, so the program prints 1.
   - For \( m > 1 \), the program uses dynamic programming to count the number of valid configurations:
     - It initializes a DP array `dp` with \( m + 1 \) elements, all set to 0.
     - It sets `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
     - It then fills the DP array using the recurrence relation:
       \[
       dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
       \]
     - This recurrence relation is correct and matches the problem's requirements:
       - \( dp[i - 1] \) accounts for placing a rook in a new row and column without mirroring.
       - \( (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2 \) accounts for placing a rook in a new row and column with mirroring, considering the two possible configurations (white rook first or black rook first).

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `dp[m]` for each test case.
   - The output is correctly formatted and matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for counting the number of different final configurations of rooks on the chessboard, given the constraints and the problem description. The dynamic programming approach used is appropriate and the recurrence relation is accurate.

Final: **True**
