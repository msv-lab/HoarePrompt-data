Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a series of `k` moves `(r_i, c_i)`. The function calculates the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` grid, given the moves, and prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, and the last values of `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and the dynamic programming array `dp` are retained, but they are not used outside the function. **
