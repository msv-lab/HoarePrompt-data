Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input for the number of test cases `t`, the size of the chessboard `n`, and the number of moves `k`. It also correctly reads the `k` moves `(r_i, c_i)` for each test case.

2. **Initial Calculation of `num`**: The function calculates `num` to count the number of rooks that have been placed on the board, considering that each move by the player and the corresponding move by the computer occupy two positions unless `r_i == c_i`, in which case only one position is occupied. This is done correctly by incrementing `num` by 1 if `r_i == c_i` and by 2 otherwise.

3. **Remaining Positions Calculation**: The function calculates `m` as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions on the board where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.

4. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The function initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` to store the number of valid configurations for different values of `m`. The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correctly set up.

5. **DP Transition**: The function correctly updates the DP array using the recurrence relation:
   \[
   dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
   \]
   This recurrence relation accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on an `i x i` board, considering the previous configurations.

6. **Output**: The function prints the result `dp[m]` for each test case, which is the number of valid final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

7. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases where `m == 0` (no remaining positions) and `m == 1` (one remaining position) correctly by printing 0 and 1, respectively.

8. **Overall Logic**: The logic of the function aligns with the problem description, ensuring that the number of valid configurations is calculated correctly for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to be correct in its implementation and logic.

Correctness: **True**
