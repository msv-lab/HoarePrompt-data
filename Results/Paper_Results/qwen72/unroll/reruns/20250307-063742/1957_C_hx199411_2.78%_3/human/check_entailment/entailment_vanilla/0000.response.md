Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Chessboard and Rooks**: We have an \( n \times n \) chessboard where you place white rooks and the computer places black rooks. No two rooks can share the same row or column.
2. **Mirroring Moves**: The computer mirrors your moves by placing a black rook at position \((c, r)\) when you place a white rook at \((r, c)\). If \( r = c \), the computer skips its turn.
3. **Valid Moves**: A valid move is placing a rook on a position \((r, c)\) such that it doesn't attack any other rook.
4. **Final Configurations**: We need to count the number of different final configurations possible after you and the computer continue playing until no valid moves remain. The result should be modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played.
   - It then reads \( k \) moves, each consisting of two integers \( c \) and \( r \).

2. **Counting Used Rows and Columns**:
   - The program initializes a variable `num` to 0.
   - For each move, it checks if \( c == r \). If true, it increments `num` by 1 (since the computer skips its turn). If false, it increments `num` by 2 (since both your move and the computer's move occupy a row and a column).

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions**:
   - The program calculates \( m = n - num \), which represents the number of remaining positions that can be used for placing rooks.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations**:
   - If \( m = 0 \), there are no valid moves left, so the program prints 0.
   - If \( m = 1 \), there is only one position left, so the program prints 1.
   - For \( m > 1 \), the program uses dynamic programming to count the number of valid configurations:
     - It initializes a DP array `dp` with \( m + 1 \) elements, all set to 0.
     - It sets `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
     - It then fills the DP array using the recurrence relation:
       \[
       dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
       \]
     - This recurrence relation accounts for:
       - Placing a rook in a new row and column without mirroring (which contributes \( dp[i - 1] \)).
       - Placing a rook in a new row and column with mirroring (which contributes \( (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2 \)).

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `dp[m]` for each test case.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- **Counting Used Positions**: The logic for counting the number of used positions is correct. If \( c == r \), only one position is used. If \( c \neq r \), two positions are used.
- **Dynamic Programming**:
  - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correct.
  - The recurrence relation \( dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) \) is correct and matches the problem's requirements.
  - The program correctly handles the modulo operation to ensure the result is within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of different final configurations of rooks on the chessboard, given the constraints and the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
