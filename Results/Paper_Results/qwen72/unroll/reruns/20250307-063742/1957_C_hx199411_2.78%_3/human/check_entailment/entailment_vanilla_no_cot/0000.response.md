Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case, including the size of the chessboard and the number of initial moves.

2. **Initial Moves Processing**: The program processes the initial moves and counts the number of rooks that are either on the diagonal (where `r == c`) or off the diagonal (where `r != c`). For each off-diagonal move, the computer places a rook in a mirrored position, effectively blocking two positions. For diagonal moves, the computer skips its turn, so only one position is blocked.

3. **Dynamic Programming for Remaining Moves**: The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations for the remaining moves. The `dp` array is used to store the number of configurations for each possible number of remaining positions. The base cases are correctly initialized:
   - `dp[1] = 1`: Only one configuration is possible if there is one remaining position.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: Three configurations are possible if there are two remaining positions (one for each rook placement and one for no rook placement).

4. **DP Transition**: The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions:
   - `dp[i - 1]`: The number of configurations where the i-th position is not used.
   - `(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2`: The number of configurations where the i-th position is used, and the i-th rook can be placed in any of the (i - 1) positions, with the mirrored position also being considered.

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\) for each test case.

The program handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
