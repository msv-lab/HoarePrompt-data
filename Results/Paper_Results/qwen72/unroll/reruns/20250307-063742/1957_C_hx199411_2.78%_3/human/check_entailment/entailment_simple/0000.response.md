### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads `k` moves.

2. **Move Counting:**
   - The program counts the number of moves where the row and column are the same (`c == r`). Each such move results in one rook being placed.
   - For moves where the row and column are different (`c != r`), the program counts two rooks being placed (one by the player and one by the computer).

3. **Remaining Moves Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `m` as the number of remaining positions on the board where no rooks have been placed yet. This is done by subtracting the total number of rooks placed (`num`) from `n`.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Final Configurations:**
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - The base cases are:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: If there is only one remaining position, there is exactly one configuration.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: If there are two remaining positions, there are three configurations.
   - For `m > 2`, the program calculates `dp[i]` using the recurrence relation:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
     - This relation accounts for placing a rook in one of the remaining positions and the subsequent configurations.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final number of configurations for each test case.

### Analysis of the Recurrence Relation:
- The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is correct because:
  - `dp[i - 1]` accounts for the configurations where a rook is placed in one of the remaining positions, and the rest of the board is filled with the configurations of `i - 1` positions.
  - `(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2` accounts for the configurations where a rook is placed in one of the remaining positions, and the computer places a rook in a mirrored position, leaving `i - 2` positions to be filled.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge cases where `m` is 0 or 1 correctly:
  - If `m == 0`, there are no remaining positions, so the number of configurations is 0.
  - If `m == 1`, there is exactly one configuration.

### Overall Correctness:
- The program follows the problem description and the constraints.
- The dynamic programming approach and the recurrence relation are correctly implemented.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow.
