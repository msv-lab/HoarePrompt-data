### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.
   - It then reads `k` moves, each represented by a pair of integers `(r_i, c_i)`.

2. **Move Counting:**
   - The function initializes `num` to 0, which is used to count the number of cells that are already occupied by rooks or are invalid due to the computer's mirroring moves.
   - For each move `(r_i, c_i)`, if `r_i == c_i`, it increments `num` by 1 (since the computer skips its turn).
   - If `r_i != c_i`, it increments `num` by 2 (since both the original move and the mirrored move occupy cells).

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - The function calculates `m` as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining cells that can be used for placing rooks.

4. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` to store the number of valid configurations for different values of `m`.
   - It sets `dp[1]` to 1 (one way to place a single rook) and `dp[2]` to 3 (three ways to place two rooks).
   - For `m >= 3`, it uses the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` to compute the number of valid configurations. This recurrence relation accounts for the fact that:
     - `dp[i - 1]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in `i-1` cells.
     - `(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2` represents the number of ways to place rooks in `i` cells by placing one rook in one of the `i-1` remaining cells and then placing another rook in one of the `i-2` remaining cells, considering both white and black rooks.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result `dp[m]` for each test case, which is the number of valid configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of valid configurations of non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` chessboard after `k` initial moves, considering the computer's mirroring behavior. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for this problem, and the recurrence relation used is correct.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

**Correctness: True**
