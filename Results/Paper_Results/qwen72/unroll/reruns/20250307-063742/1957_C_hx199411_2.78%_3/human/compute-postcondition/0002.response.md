Output State: **t is 0, n and k retain their last input values, num is the final calculated value for the last test case, m is the final calculated value for the last test case, and dp is the final dynamic programming array for the last test case.**

### Explanation:
- **t**: The loop runs `t` times, and each iteration decrements `t` by 1. After all iterations, `t` will be 0.
- **n and k**: These variables are read from the input for each test case and will retain their values from the last test case after the loop finishes.
- **num**: This variable is used to count the number of moves that either match the row and column or do not. It will retain the final value calculated for the last test case.
- **m**: This variable is calculated as `n - num` and will retain the final value for the last test case.
- **dp**: This is a dynamic programming array used to compute the number of ways to arrange the remaining moves. It will retain the final values computed for the last test case, with `dp[m]` being the result printed for the last test case.

The loop processes each test case independently, so the state of these variables after the loop is determined by the last test case processed.
