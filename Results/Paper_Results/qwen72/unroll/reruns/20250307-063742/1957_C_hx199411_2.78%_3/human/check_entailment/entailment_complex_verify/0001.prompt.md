You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a series of `k` moves `(r_i, c_i)`. The function calculates the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` grid, given the moves, and prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, and the last values of `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and the dynamic programming array `dp` are retained, but they are not used outside the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Chessboard and Rooks**: We have an \( n \times n \) chessboard where you place white rooks and the computer places black rooks. No two rooks can share the same row or column.
2. **Mirroring Moves**: The computer mirrors your moves by placing a black rook at position \((c, r)\) when you place a white rook at \((r, c)\). If \( r = c \), the computer skips its turn.
3. **Valid Moves**: A valid move is placing a rook on a position \((r, c)\) such that it doesn't attack any other rook.
4. **Final Configurations**: We need to count the number of different final configurations possible after you and the computer continue playing until no valid moves remain. The result should be modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played.
   - It then reads \( k \) moves, each consisting of two integers \( c \) and \( r \).

2. **Counting Used Rows and Columns**:
   - The program initializes a variable `num` to 0.
   - For each move, it checks if \( c == r \). If true, it increments `num` by 1 (since the computer skips its turn). If false, it increments `num` by 2 (since both your move and the computer's move occupy a row and a column).

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions**:
   - The program calculates \( m = n - num \), which represents the number of remaining positions that can be used for placing rooks.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations**:
   - If \( m = 0 \), there are no valid moves left, so the program prints 0.
   - If \( m = 1 \), there is only one position left, so the program prints 1.
   - For \( m > 1 \), the program uses dynamic programming to count the number of valid configurations:
     - It initializes a DP array `dp` with \( m + 1 \) elements, all set to 0.
     - It sets `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
     - It then fills the DP array using the recurrence relation:
       \[
       dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
       \]
     - This recurrence relation accounts for:
       - Placing a rook in a new row and column without mirroring (which contributes \( dp[i - 1] \)).
       - Placing a rook in a new row and column with mirroring (which contributes \( (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2 \)).

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `dp[m]` for each test case.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- **Counting Used Positions**: The logic for counting the number of used positions is correct. If \( c == r \), only one position is used. If \( c \neq r \), two positions are used.
- **Dynamic Programming**:
  - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correct.
  - The recurrence relation \( dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) \) is correct and matches the problem's requirements.
  - The program correctly handles the modulo operation to ensure the result is within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of different final configurations of rooks on the chessboard, given the constraints and the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
