The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on a set of test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and a list of moves `(r_i, c_i)`. The constraints indicate that `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the size of a grid, `k` is an integer related to the number of moves, and each move `(r_i, c_i)` represents a row and column within the grid. The function returns a result for each test case based on the inputs `n`, `k`, and the moves.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and a list of moves `(r_i, c_i)`. It returns a result for each test case based on the inputs, where `n` is the size of a grid, `k` is an integer related to the number of moves, and each move `(r_i, c_i)` represents a unique row and column within the grid.**
