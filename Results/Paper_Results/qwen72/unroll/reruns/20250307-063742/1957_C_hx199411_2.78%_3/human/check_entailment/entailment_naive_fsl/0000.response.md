Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program incorrectly handles the case where `k` is 0. According to the problem description, if `k` is 0, the initial state of the board is empty, and you should be able to place rooks in a way that maximizes the number of different final configurations. However, the program does not account for this scenario and directly enters the loop that processes the `k` moves, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 0
```
The program should output the number of possible final configurations for a 4x4 board with no initial moves. However, the program will not enter the loop that processes the moves and will incorrectly output 0, which is not the correct answer. The correct answer for this case should be the number of configurations possible when starting with an empty board, which is more than 0.
