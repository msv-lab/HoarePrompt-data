You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an input integer, `start` is the maximum value encountered for `t == 1`, `end` is the minimum value encountered for `t == 2`, `num` is a list containing all values encountered for `t == 3`.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an input integer, `start` is the maximum value encountered for `t == 1`, `end` is the minimum value encountered for `t == 2`, `num` is a list containing all values encountered for `t == 3`, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive).
    if (start > end) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: `n` is an input integer, `start` is the maximum value encountered for `t == 1`, `end` is the minimum value encountered for `t == 2`, `num` is a list containing all values encountered for `t == 3`, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive), and `start` is less than or equal to `end`.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive), if this difference is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive). Otherwise, the program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function returns 0 if the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive), is less than the number of elements in `num` within the range. Otherwise, it returns this difference.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive), if this difference is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive). Otherwise, the program returns 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
