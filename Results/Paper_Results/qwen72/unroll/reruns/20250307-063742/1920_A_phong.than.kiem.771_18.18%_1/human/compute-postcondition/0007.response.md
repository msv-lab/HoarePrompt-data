Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `start` is the maximum value encountered for `t == 1`, `end` is the minimum value encountered for `t == 2`, `num` is a list containing all values encountered for `t == 3`, `count_num` is 0.** 

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `count_num` is now initialized to 0.
