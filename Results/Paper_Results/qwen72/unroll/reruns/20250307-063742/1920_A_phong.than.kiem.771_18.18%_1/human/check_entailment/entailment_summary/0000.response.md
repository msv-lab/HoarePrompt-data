Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of integers `k` that satisfy a set of constraints. Let's break down the program and its functions to see if it meets the requirements:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input. It is used correctly in the main program to determine how many times the main loop should run.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is not used in the main program. It is designed to read and process input lines, but it is not necessary for the given problem. Its absence in the main program does not affect the correctness of the solution.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is also not used in the main program. It is designed to join a list of integers into a string with a specified separator, which is not relevant to the problem. Its absence does not affect the correctness of the solution.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function is not used in the main program. It is designed to find all starting indices of a substring within a string, which is not relevant to the problem. Its absence does not affect the correctness of the solution.

5. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This function is not used in the main program. It is designed to find all indices of a specific element in a list, which is not relevant to the problem. Its absence does not affect the correctness of the solution.

6. **Function `func_6`**:
   - This function is not used in the main program. It is designed to find a sub-list in a list of lists where a specific element at a given index matches a value, which is not relevant to the problem. Its absence does not affect the correctness of the solution.

7. **Function `func_7`**:
   - This function is the core of the solution. It processes each test case by reading the number of constraints `n` and then reading `n` lines of constraints. It correctly updates the `start` and `end` variables to reflect the minimum and maximum bounds for `k` based on constraints of type 1 and 2, respectively. It also collects all values that `k` must not be equal to in the `num` list.
   - After processing the constraints, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` that fall within the range `[start, end]` and are not in the `num` list. If `start` is greater than `end`, it correctly returns 0, indicating no valid integers.
   - The function returns the correct result by computing the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, and subtracting the count of invalid values in `num` that fall within the range.

The main program:
- Reads the number of test cases using `func_1`.
- For each test case, it calls `func_7` to process the constraints and find the number of valid integers `k`.
- It collects the results in the `ans` list and prints each result.

Given that `func_7` correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k`, and the main program correctly handles multiple test cases, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
