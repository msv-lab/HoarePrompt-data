### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_7` reads the number of constraints `n` and initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to \(10^9\). These values represent the minimum and maximum possible values for `k` respectively.
   - It also initializes an empty list `num` to store the values of `k` that must be avoided (type 3 constraints).

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - The function reads each constraint and updates `start` and `end` accordingly:
     - If the constraint type is 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is 3 (k must be not equal to x), it appends `x` to the `num` list.

3. **Counting Invalid Values:**
   - The function then counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`. This is done by iterating over `num` and checking if each value is within the range. If it is, the count `count_num` is incremented.

4. **Calculating the Valid Range:**
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it means there is no valid range for `k`, and the function returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers in the range `[start, end]` by computing `end - start + 1` and subtracting the count of invalid values `count_num`.

5. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The function ensures that if the valid range is empty (i.e., `start > end`), it returns 0.
   - It also ensures that if the number of invalid values exceeds the valid range, it returns 0.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initialization:**
  - `start` is initialized to -1, which is a reasonable choice because it ensures that any valid constraint of type 1 will update `start` to a non-negative value.
  - `end` is initialized to \(10^9\), which is a reasonable choice because it ensures that any valid constraint of type 2 will update `end` to a value less than or equal to \(10^9\).

- **Constraint Processing:**
  - For type 1 constraints, the function correctly updates `start` to the maximum of the current `start` and the constraint value `x`.
  - For type 2 constraints, the function correctly updates `end` to the minimum of the current `end` and the constraint value `x`.
  - For type 3 constraints, the function correctly appends the constraint value `x` to the `num` list.

- **Counting Invalid Values:**
  - The function iterates over the `num` list and counts how many values fall within the range `[start, end]`. This is done correctly by checking if each value `i` in `num` satisfies `start <= i <= end`.

- **Valid Range Calculation:**
  - The function checks if `start` is greater than `end`. If so, it returns 0, which is correct because it means there is no valid range for `k`.
  - If `start` is not greater than `end`, it calculates the number of valid integers in the range `[start, end]` by computing `end - start + 1` and subtracting the count of invalid values `count_num`.
  - The condition `if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0` ensures that if the number of invalid values exceeds the valid range, the function returns 0, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided example. The function `func_7` correctly processes the constraints, counts the invalid values, and calculates the number of valid integers in the range `[start, end]`.

Final: **True**
