Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

        #The program returns an integer value that is input by the user.
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is `False`, it prompts the user to input an integer and returns that integer. If `isOne` is `True`, it returns the integer 1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean indicating whether to split the input line by spaces, and to_int is a boolean indicating whether to convert the split items to integers.
def func_2(space, to_int):
    line = input()

    #State: *`space` is a boolean indicating whether to split the input line by spaces, `to_int` is a boolean indicating whether to convert the split items to integers, `line` is an input string. If `space` is `True`, `items` is a list of strings resulting from splitting `line` by spaces. If `space` is `False`, `items` is a list of characters from `line`.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is the result of converting the strings in `items` to integers. `items` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input string `line` by spaces, since `space` is `True` and `to_int` is `True`.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns a list of characters from the input string `line` since `space` is `False` and `to_int` is `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two boolean parameters, `space` and `to_int`. It reads an input string from the user. If `space` is `True`, it splits the input string by spaces into a list of substrings. If `space` is `False`, it converts the input string into a list of individual characters. If `to_int` is `True`, it converts each item in the list to an integer and returns the list of integers. If `to_int` is `False`, it returns the list of substrings or characters without conversion.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and sym is a string used as a separator.
def func_3(arr, sym):
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
        
    #State: Output State: `string` is a string containing all the integers from `arr` converted to strings, each followed by the separator `sym`. The last integer in `arr` is also followed by `sym`. The `arr` and `sym` variables remain unchanged.
    return string
    #The program returns a string containing all the integers from `arr` converted to strings, each followed by the separator `sym`. The last integer in `arr` is also followed by `sym`. The `arr` and `sym` variables remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a string `sym` as a separator. It returns a string where each integer from `arr` is converted to a string and followed by `sym`, including the last integer. The input parameters `arr` and `sym` remain unchanged after the function execution.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string and substring are strings, where substring is a potential substring of string.
def func_4(string, substring):
    indices = []

    return indices
    #The program returns the list `indices` which contains all the starting indices of `substring` in `string`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two parameters, `string` and `substring`, both of which are strings. It returns a list of integers, `indices`, which contains all the starting indices where `substring` is found within `string`. If `substring` is not found in `string`, the function returns an empty list. After the function concludes, the program state is such that `indices` contains all the starting indices of `substring` in `string`, and the variable `index` is -1.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and element is an integer.
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices where the value in `arr` is equal to `element`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `element`. It returns a list of indices where the value in `arr` is equal to `element`. If `element` is not found in `arr`, it returns an empty list.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, index is a non-negative integer, and value is an integer.
def func_6(arr, index, value):
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
        
    #State: The loop returns the first subArray in arr where subArray[index] equals value, or it does not return anything (i.e., None) if no such subArray is found. The variables arr, index, and value remain unchanged.
    return None
    #The program returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a list of lists `arr`, a non-negative integer `index`, and an integer `value`. It returns the first sub-list in `arr` where the element at the specified `index` equals `value`. If no such sub-list is found, it returns `None`. The input parameters `arr`, `index`, and `value` remain unchanged.

#Function 7:

        #The program returns 0.
    #State: `n` is an input integer, `start` is the maximum value encountered for `t == 1`, `end` is the minimum value encountered for `t == 2`, `num` is a list containing all values encountered for `t == 3`, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive), and `start` is less than or equal to `end`.

    #The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive), if this difference is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive). Otherwise, the program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` reads an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 100) and then reads `n` lines of input, each containing two integers `t` and `v`. It updates the `start` variable to the maximum value encountered for `t == 1`, the `end` variable to the minimum value encountered for `t == 2`, and appends values encountered for `t == 3` to a list `num`. After processing the inputs, the function calculates the number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive). If `start` is greater than `end`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the count of elements in `num` within the range, but only if this difference is greater than or equal to the count. If the difference is less than the count, the function returns 0.
