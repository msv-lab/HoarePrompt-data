You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 7 : The function `func_7` reads an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 100) and then reads `n` lines of input, each containing two integers `t` and `v`. It updates the `start` variable to the maximum value encountered for `t == 1`, the `end` variable to the minimum value encountered for `t == 2`, and appends values encountered for `t == 3` to a list `num`. After processing the inputs, the function calculates the number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive). If `start` is greater than `end`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the count of elements in `num` within the range, but only if this difference is greater than or equal to the count. If the difference is less than the count, the function returns 0.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_7` reads the number of constraints `n` and initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to \(10^9\). These values represent the minimum and maximum possible values for `k` respectively.
   - It also initializes an empty list `num` to store the values of `k` that must be avoided (type 3 constraints).

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - The function reads each constraint and updates `start` and `end` accordingly:
     - If the constraint type is 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is 3 (k must be not equal to x), it appends `x` to the `num` list.

3. **Counting Invalid Values:**
   - The function then counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`. This is done by iterating over `num` and checking if each value is within the range. If it is, the count `count_num` is incremented.

4. **Calculating the Valid Range:**
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it means there is no valid range for `k`, and the function returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers in the range `[start, end]` by computing `end - start + 1` and subtracting the count of invalid values `count_num`.

5. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The function ensures that if the valid range is empty (i.e., `start > end`), it returns 0.
   - It also ensures that if the number of invalid values exceeds the valid range, it returns 0.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the constraints and updates the `start` and `end` values.
- It correctly counts the invalid values within the valid range.
- The final calculation of the number of valid integers is correct and handles edge cases appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
