### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n` using `func_1()`. However, the function `func_1` is incorrectly defined with a parameter `isOne` that is not used in the main program. This is a potential issue, but it doesn't affect the correctness of the program as long as `isOne` is always `False` when called from the main program.
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of constraints `n` and then processes each constraint using a loop.

2. **Constraint Processing:**
   - The program initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to a very large number (1000000000.0). These variables are used to track the minimum and maximum bounds for `k`, respectively.
   - For each constraint:
     - If the constraint type is 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), the program updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), the program updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is 3 (k must be not equal to x), the program appends `x` to the list `num`.

3. **Counting Valid Integers:**
   - The program then counts the number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive) and stores this count in `count_num`.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, the program returns 0, indicating that no valid integers exist.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the number of valid integers as `end - start + 1 - count_num` and returns this value. This calculation correctly accounts for the range of integers and the excluded values.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the result of each test case to the list `ans` and prints each result at the end.

### Issues:
- **Function `func_1` Parameter:**
  - The function `func_1` is defined with a parameter `isOne` that is not used in the main program. This is a minor issue but could lead to confusion. The function should be defined without this parameter or the parameter should be used appropriately.
  
- **Floating Point `end`:**
  - The variable `end` is initialized as a floating-point number (1000000000.0). However, since all constraints and calculations involve integers, `end` should be an integer. This is not a critical issue but is a potential source of confusion.

### Conclusion:
Despite the minor issues with `func_1` and the floating-point initialization of `end`, the core logic of the program is correct. The program correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
