### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_7` reads the number of constraints `n` and initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to \(10^9\). These values represent the minimum and maximum possible values for `k` respectively.
   - It also initializes an empty list `num` to store the values of `k` that must be avoided (type 3 constraints).

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - The function reads each constraint and updates `start` and `end` accordingly:
     - If the constraint type is 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is 3 (k must be not equal to x), it appends `x` to the `num` list.

3. **Counting Invalid Values:**
   - The function then counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`. This is done by iterating over `num` and checking if each value is within the range. If it is, the count `count_num` is incremented.

4. **Calculating the Valid Range:**
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it means there is no valid range for `k`, and the function returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers in the range `[start, end]` by computing `end - start + 1` and subtracting the count of invalid values `count_num`.

5. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The function ensures that if the valid range is empty (i.e., `start > end`), it returns 0.
   - It also ensures that if the number of invalid values exceeds the valid range, it returns 0.

### Validation with Annotated Code:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - This function is used to read the number of test cases `t` and returns it as an integer.
  - The function is correctly implemented and used in the main program.

- **Function 7 (`func_7`):**
  - **Initialization:**
    - `start` is initialized to -1, which is the smallest possible value for `k`.
    - `end` is initialized to \(10^9\), which is the largest possible value for `k`.
    - `num` is initialized as an empty list to store values that `k` must not be equal to.
  - **Processing Constraints:**
    - For each constraint, the function correctly updates `start` and `end` based on the type of constraint.
    - Type 1 constraints update `start` to the maximum value encountered.
    - Type 2 constraints update `end` to the minimum value encountered.
    - Type 3 constraints add the value to the `num` list.
  - **Counting Invalid Values:**
    - The function iterates over the `num` list and counts how many values fall within the range `[start, end]`.
  - **Calculating the Valid Range:**
    - If `start` is greater than `end`, the function correctly returns 0.
    - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers in the range `[start, end]` and subtracts the count of invalid values.
    - The final return statement ensures that the result is non-negative.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly processes the constraints, updates the `start` and `end` values, counts the invalid values, and calculates the number of valid integers. The edge cases are handled appropriately, and the program produces the correct output for the given problem description and example.

Final: **True**
