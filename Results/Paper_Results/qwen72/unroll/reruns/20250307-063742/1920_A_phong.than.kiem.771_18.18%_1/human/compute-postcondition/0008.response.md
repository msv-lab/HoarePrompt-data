The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `num`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `num`. If `num` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `n`, `start`, `end`, and `count_num` does not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `num` must have at least one element, and `i` will be the first element of `num` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `start` is the maximum value encountered for `t == 1`, `end` is the minimum value encountered for `t == 2`, `num` is a list containing all values encountered for `t == 3` and must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `num`, `count_num` is 0**
