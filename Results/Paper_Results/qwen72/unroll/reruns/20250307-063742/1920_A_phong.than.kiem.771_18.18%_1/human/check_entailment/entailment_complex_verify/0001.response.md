### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_7` reads the number of constraints `n` and initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to \(10^9\). These values represent the minimum and maximum possible values for `k` respectively.
   - It also initializes an empty list `num` to store the values of `k` that must be avoided (type 3 constraints).

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - The function reads each constraint and updates `start` and `end` accordingly:
     - If the constraint type is 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is 3 (k must be not equal to x), it appends `x` to the `num` list.

3. **Counting Invalid Values:**
   - The function then counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`. This is done by iterating over `num` and checking if each value is within the range. If it is, the count `count_num` is incremented.

4. **Calculating the Valid Range:**
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it means there is no valid range for `k`, and the function returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers in the range `[start, end]` by computing `end - start + 1` and subtracting the count of invalid values `count_num`.

5. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The function ensures that if the valid range is empty (i.e., `start > end`), it returns 0.
   - It also ensures that if the number of invalid values exceeds the valid range, it returns 0.

### Validation of Original Assessment:

- **Initialization:**
  - `start` is initialized to -1 and `end` to \(10^9\). This is appropriate because the constraints guarantee at least one type 1 and one type 2 constraint, ensuring that `start` and `end` will be updated to valid values.
  - `num` is correctly initialized as an empty list to store the values to be avoided.

- **Processing Constraints:**
  - The constraints are processed correctly. `start` is updated to the maximum value of type 1 constraints, and `end` is updated to the minimum value of type 2 constraints.
  - Type 3 constraints are correctly appended to the `num` list.

- **Counting Invalid Values:**
  - The function correctly counts the number of values in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`.

- **Calculating the Valid Range:**
  - The function correctly returns 0 if `start` is greater than `end`.
  - The final calculation `end - start + 1 - count_num` is correct and handles the edge case where the number of invalid values exceeds the valid range.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the constraints, updates the `start` and `end` values, counts the invalid values, and calculates the number of valid integers in the range `[start, end]`. The edge cases are also handled appropriately.

Final: **True**
