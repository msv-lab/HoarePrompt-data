The function `func_7` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the output description, it seems to operate on variables `start`, `end`, and `num`, where `num` is a list of integers, and `start` and `end` are integers that define a range. The function returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`, if this difference is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `num` within the range. Otherwise, it returns 0.

Functionality: **The function returns 0 if the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive), is less than the number of elements in `num` within the range. Otherwise, it returns this difference.**
