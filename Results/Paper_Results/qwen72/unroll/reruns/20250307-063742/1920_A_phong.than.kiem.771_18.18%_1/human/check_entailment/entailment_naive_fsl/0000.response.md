Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input format as specified in the problem description. According to the problem, the input consists of multiple test cases, and the first line of the input specifies the number of test cases. However, the provided program does not read this number of test cases and does not loop over each test case. Instead, it only processes a single test case. This means the program will fail to produce the correct output for inputs with multiple test cases. 

For example, the input:
```
2
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
2
1 5
2 4
```
The program will only process the first test case and not the second one, leading to an incorrect output.
