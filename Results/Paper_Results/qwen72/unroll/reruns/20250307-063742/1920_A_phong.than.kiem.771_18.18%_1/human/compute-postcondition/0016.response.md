Functionality: ** The function `func_7` reads an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 100) and then reads `n` lines of input, each containing two integers `t` and `v`. It updates the `start` variable to the maximum value encountered for `t == 1`, the `end` variable to the minimum value encountered for `t == 2`, and appends values encountered for `t == 3` to a list `num`. After processing the inputs, the function calculates the number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive). If `start` is greater than `end`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the count of elements in `num` within the range, but only if this difference is greater than or equal to the count. If the difference is less than the count, the function returns 0. **
