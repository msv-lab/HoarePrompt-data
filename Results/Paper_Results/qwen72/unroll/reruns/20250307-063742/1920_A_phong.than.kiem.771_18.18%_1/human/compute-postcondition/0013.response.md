Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `start` is the maximum value encountered for `t == 1`, `end` is the minimum value encountered for `t == 2`, `num` is a list containing all values encountered for `t == 3`, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive), and `start` is less than or equal to `end`.**
