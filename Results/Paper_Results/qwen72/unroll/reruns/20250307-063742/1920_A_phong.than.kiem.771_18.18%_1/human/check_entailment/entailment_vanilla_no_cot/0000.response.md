Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the number of constraints, processes each constraint to determine the valid range for `k`, and then counts how many numbers within this range are not excluded by the "not equal" constraints. The program handles the edge cases where the range is invalid (i.e., `start > end`) and returns the correct number of valid integers `k` for each test case. The functions `func_1` to `func_6` are not used in the solution, but their presence does not affect the correctness of the program. The core function `func_7` is the one that solves the problem, and it does so correctly.
