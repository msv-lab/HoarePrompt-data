The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of elements `n`, the limit on removals `k`, the limit on negations `x`, and an array `a` of integers. For each test case, it computes and prints the maximum possible sum of the array after simulating the removal of up to `k` elements and the negation of up to `x` elements. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The input variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a` are read from standard input and remain unchanged after the function concludes.
