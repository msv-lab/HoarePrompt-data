You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of elements `n`, the limit on removals `k`, the limit on negations `x`, and an array `a` of integers. For each test case, it computes and prints the maximum possible sum of the array after simulating the removal of up to `k` elements and the negation of up to `x` elements. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The input variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a` are read from standard input and remain unchanged after the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Alice's Step**: Alice can remove at most `k` elements from the array to maximize the sum.
2. **Bob's Step**: Bob can multiply at most `x` elements by -1 to minimize the sum.
3. **Objective**: Find the optimal sum of the array after both players have played their moves.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and sorts it in descending order.

2. **Initial Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the initial sum of the array `ans1`.

3. **Bob's Moves**:
   - The program simulates Bob's moves by subtracting `2 * a[i]` for the first `x` elements from `ans1`. This is because multiplying an element by -1 and then adding it back to the sum effectively subtracts `2 * a[i]` from the initial sum.

4. **Alice's Moves**:
   - The program iterates over the first `k` elements (Alice's potential removals).
   - For each element `a[i]` that Alice could remove, it adds `a[i]` back to `ans1` and, if possible, subtracts `2 * a[i + x]` to simulate Bob's subsequent moves.
   - It keeps track of the maximum sum `ans2` after each potential removal and subsequent Bob's moves.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum sum `ans2` for each test case.

### Detailed Reasoning:
- **Sorting in Descending Order**:
  - Sorting the array in descending order ensures that Alice can consider removing the smallest elements first, which is optimal for maximizing the sum.
  - Bob's moves are then applied to the largest elements first, which is optimal for minimizing the sum.

- **Initial Sum Calculation**:
  - The initial sum `ans1` is calculated correctly by summing all elements of the array.

- **Bob's Moves**:
  - The program correctly simulates Bob's moves by subtracting `2 * a[i]` for the first `x` elements. This is because multiplying an element by -1 and then adding it back to the sum effectively subtracts `2 * a[i]`.

- **Alice's Moves**:
  - The program correctly iterates over the first `k` elements to simulate Alice's potential removals.
  - For each removal, it updates `ans1` by adding `a[i]` back to the sum and, if possible, subtracts `2 * a[i + x]` to simulate Bob's subsequent moves.
  - It keeps track of the maximum sum `ans2` after each potential removal and subsequent Bob's moves.

- **Output**:
  - The program prints the maximum sum `ans2` for each test case, which is the correct output based on the problem description.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array**:
  - If `n = 1`, Alice can remove the element, and the sum will be 0. The program handles this correctly.
- **All Elements Removed by Alice**:
  - If `k = n`, Alice can remove all elements, and the sum will be 0. The program handles this correctly.
- **No Elements Multiplied by Bob**:
  - If `x = 0`, Bob does not make any moves, and the sum will be the sum of the remaining elements after Alice's removals. The program handles this correctly.
- **All Elements Multiplied by Bob**:
  - If `x = n`, Bob can multiply all remaining elements by -1. The program handles this correctly by considering the maximum possible sum after Alice's removals.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly simulates the game as described in the problem and handles all edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
