Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. Here's why:

1. **Alice's Strategy**:
   - Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. However, the program sorts the array in descending order (`reverse=True`), which means Alice will remove the largest elements, which is incorrect.

2. **Bob's Strategy**:
   - Bob should multiply the smallest elements by -1 to minimize the sum. The program attempts to do this by subtracting twice the value of the smallest elements, but it does not correctly consider the elements that should be negated after Alice's removal.

3. **Combined Strategy**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the interaction between Alice's removal and Bob's negation. Specifically, it does not ensure that Bob negates the smallest remaining elements after Alice's removal.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Sort the Array**:
   - Sort the array in ascending order to facilitate the removal of the smallest elements by Alice and the negation of the smallest elements by Bob.

2. **Alice's Removal**:
   - Remove the smallest `k` elements from the array.

3. **Bob's Negation**:
   - Negate the smallest `x` elements from the remaining array.

4. **Calculate the Sum**:
   - Calculate the sum of the modified array after both players have made their moves.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
        # Alice removes the smallest k elements
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob negates the smallest x elements
        for i in range(min(x, len(a))):
            if a[i] < 0:
                a[i] = -a[i]
        
        # Calculate the sum of the modified array
        ans = sum(a)
        
        # If Bob has more negations left, he can negate the smallest positive element
        if x > len(a):
            x -= len(a)
            if x % 2 == 1:
                ans -= 2 * min(a)
        
        print(ans)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Sorting**: The array is sorted in ascending order to facilitate the removal of the smallest elements by Alice and the negation of the smallest elements by Bob.
- **Alice's Removal**: The smallest `k` elements are removed using slicing.
- **Bob's Negation**: The smallest `x` elements are negated. If there are more negations left than elements, Bob can negate the smallest positive element if the number of remaining negations is odd.
- **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the modified array is calculated and printed.

This approach ensures that both players play optimally according to the problem description.
