To ensure the for loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the variable `t` and the loop iterator `_`. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The iterator `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer input, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases, and `t` must be greater than 0**
