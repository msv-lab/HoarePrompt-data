You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

    0
    2
    0

    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of elements `n`, the limit on removals `k`, the limit on negations `x`, and an array `a` of integers. For each test case, it computes and prints the maximum possible sum of the array after simulating the removal of up to `k` elements and the negation of up to `x` elements. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The input variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a` are read from standard input and remain unchanged after the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where Alice can remove elements to optimize the sum before Bob makes his moves. Specifically, the program assumes that Alice will always remove the largest elements, which is not necessarily the optimal strategy.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 1 1
1 2 3
```

According to the problem description, Alice can remove at most 1 element, and Bob can multiply at most 1 element by -1. The optimal strategy for Alice would be to remove the element `3`, leaving the array `[1, 2]`. Bob would then multiply the smallest element `1` by -1, resulting in the array `[-1, 2]`. The final sum would be `1`.

However, the program will output `0` for this test case because it incorrectly assumes that Alice will remove the largest element and Bob will multiply the next largest element by -1, resulting in the array `[1, -2]` with a sum of `-1`.

This shows that the program does not consider the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob, leading to incorrect results for some cases.
