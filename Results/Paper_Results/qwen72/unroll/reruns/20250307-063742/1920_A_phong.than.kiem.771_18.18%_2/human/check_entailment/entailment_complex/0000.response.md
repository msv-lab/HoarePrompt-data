### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is responsible for reading the number of test cases (`t`). However, it takes an unnecessary boolean parameter `isOne` which is not used in the context of the problem. The function should simply return the integer input by the user.
   - **Issue**: The boolean parameter `isOne` is redundant and should be removed.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads and processes a line of input based on the `space` and `to_int` parameters. It is not used in the main logic of the program, and there is no indication that it is needed for the problem.
   - **Issue**: This function is not necessary for the problem and should be removed.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function converts a list of integers to a string with a specified separator. It is not used in the main logic of the program and is not necessary for the problem.
   - **Issue**: This function is not necessary and should be removed.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function finds all starting indices of a substring within a string. It is not used in the main logic of the program and is not necessary for the problem.
   - **Issue**: This function is not necessary and should be removed.

5. **Function 5 (`func_5`)**:
   - This function finds all indices of a given element in a list. It is not used in the main logic of the program and is not necessary for the problem.
   - **Issue**: This function is not necessary and should be removed.

6. **Function 6 (`func_6`)**:
   - This function searches for a sub-list in a list of lists where the element at a specified index matches a given value. It is not used in the main logic of the program and is not necessary for the problem.
   - **Issue**: This function is not necessary and should be removed.

7. **Function 7 (`func_7`)**:
   - This function correctly processes the constraints for each test case. It reads the number of constraints `n`, and then reads each constraint, updating the `start` and `end` values accordingly. It also keeps track of the values that `k` must not be equal to (`num` list).
   - After processing the constraints, it counts the number of invalid values within the range `[start, end]` and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `start` is greater than `end` by returning 0.
   - **Correctness**: This function is correctly implemented to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
- The main logic of the program is correctly implemented in `func_7`.
- However, the program includes several unnecessary functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`) that are not used and do not contribute to solving the problem.
- The `func_1` function has an unnecessary parameter and should be simplified.

### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the inclusion of unnecessary functions and the redundant parameter in `func_1`. These issues do not affect the correctness of the main logic in `func_7`, but they make the program unnecessarily complex and violate the principle of minimalism and clarity in code.
