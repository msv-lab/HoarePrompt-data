Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n` using `func_1()`. However, `func_1()` is incorrectly defined with an unused parameter `isOne`. The function should simply return `int(input())` without any parameters. This is a minor issue, but it could lead to confusion.

2. **Constraint Processing**: For each test case, the program reads the number of constraints `n` and then processes each constraint:
   - If the constraint type `t` is 1 (k must be greater than or equal to `v`), it updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `v`.
   - If the constraint type `t` is 2 (k must be less than or equal to `v`), it updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `v`.
   - If the constraint type `t` is 3 (k must not be equal to `v`), it appends `v` to the list `num`.

3. **Range Validation**: After processing all constraints, the program checks if the range defined by `start` and `end` is valid (`start <= end`). If not, it returns 0, which is correct because no integer can satisfy an invalid range.

4. **Exclusion of Specific Values**: The program then counts the number of values in `num` that fall within the valid range `[start, end]` and subtracts this count from the total number of integers in the range. This is the correct approach to exclude specific values from the range.

5. **Final Calculation**: The final result is calculated as `end - start + 1 - count_num`, which is the number of integers in the range `[start, end]` minus the number of excluded values. If the result is negative, it returns 0, which is also correct.

6. **Output**: The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

- **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` should not have the `isOne` parameter. It should simply read and return the number of test cases.
- **Floating Point `end`**: The variable `end` is initialized as a floating-point number `1000000000.0`. It should be an integer to avoid potential issues with floating-point arithmetic.

Given these issues, the program is mostly correct but has a few minor problems that need fixing. However, the core logic for solving the problem is sound.

Correctness: **False**

### Suggested Fixes:
1. **Remove `isOne` Parameter from `func_1`**:
   ```python
   def func_1():
       return int(input())
   ```

2. **Initialize `end` as an Integer**:
   ```python
   end = 1000000000
   ```

After these fixes, the program should work correctly for the given problem.
