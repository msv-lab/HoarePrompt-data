For the loop to execute, the state of the objects in the loop head, specifically `i` and `num`, must be adjusted. The loop will only execute if `num` is a non-empty list. The variable `i` will take on the values of the elements in `num` during each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer input by the user, and 2 <= n <= 100
- `start` is the maximum value of `v` for all `t == 1` inputs, or -1 if no such input exists
- `end` is the minimum value of `v` for all `t == 2` inputs, or 1000000000.0 if no such input exists
- `num` is a list containing all `v` values for which `t == 3`
- `count_num` is 0

To ensure the loop executes, `num` must have at least one element. The variable `i` will be set to the first element of `num` before the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, and 2 <= n <= 100; `start` is the maximum value of `v` for all `t == 1` inputs, or -1 if no such input exists; `end` is the minimum value of `v` for all `t == 2` inputs, or 1000000000.0 if no such input exists; `num` is a list containing all `v` values for which `t == 3` and must have at least one element; `count_num` is 0; `i` is the first element in `num`**
