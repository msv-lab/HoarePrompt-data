Functionality: **The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, if the total number of integers in a specified range (`end - start + 1`) is greater than or equal to the number of elements in a list `num` that fall within this range (`count_num`), it returns the difference between `end - start + 1` and `count_num`. Otherwise, it returns 0.**
