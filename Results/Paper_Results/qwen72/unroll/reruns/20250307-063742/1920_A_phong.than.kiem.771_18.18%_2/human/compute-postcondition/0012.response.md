Output State: **The program returns 0.** 

In this case, the program explicitly returns the integer value 0, regardless of the initial state of the variables `count_num`, `n`, `start`, `end`, and `num`. The condition that `start` is greater than `end` does not affect the return value since the return statement is a constant value.
