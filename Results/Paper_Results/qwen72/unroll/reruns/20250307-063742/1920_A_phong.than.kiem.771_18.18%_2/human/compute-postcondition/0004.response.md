The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Given the initial state, `n` is an integer input by the user with the constraint 2 <= n <= 100, which already ensures that `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n`. The variable `i` is automatically initialized by the `range(n)` function, starting from 0.

Thus, the state before the loop starts, ensuring the loop will execute, is:
State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, and 2 <= n <= 100; `i` is 0**
