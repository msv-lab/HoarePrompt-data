Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, and 2 <= n <= 100; `start` is the maximum value of `v` for all `t == 1` inputs, or -1 if no such input exists; `end` is the minimum value of `v` for all `t == 2` inputs, or 1000000000.0 if no such input exists; `num` is a list containing all `v` values for which `t == 3`; `count_num` is 0.**

The code initializes a new variable `count_num` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `start`, `end`, or `num`, which remain as they were in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `count_num`.
