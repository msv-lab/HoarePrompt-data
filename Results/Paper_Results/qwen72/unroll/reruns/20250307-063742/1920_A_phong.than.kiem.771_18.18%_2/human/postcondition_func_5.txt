The function `func_6` accepts a list of lists `arr`, a non-negative integer `index`, and an integer `value`. It searches through `arr` for the first sub-list where the element at the specified `index` is equal to `value`. If such a sub-list is found, it returns that sub-list. If no such sub-list is found, it returns `None`. The state of `arr`, `index`, and `value` remains unchanged after the function concludes.
