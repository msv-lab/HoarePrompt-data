You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer input by the user, and 2 <= n <= 100; `start` is the maximum value of `v` for all `t == 1` inputs, or -1 if no such input exists; `end` is the minimum value of `v` for all `t == 2` inputs, or 1000000000.0 if no such input exists; `num` is a list containing all `v` values for which `t == 3`.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`. The values of `n`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged. `num` remains the same list of values.
    if (start > end) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`. The values of `n`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged. `num` remains the same list of values. `start` is less than or equal to `end`.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #The program returns the difference between `end - start + 1` and `count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`. Otherwise, the program returns 0. `end - start + 1` is the total number of integers in the range from `start` to `end` (inclusive), and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that fall within this range.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, if the total number of integers in a specified range (`end - start + 1`) is greater than or equal to the number of elements in a list `num` that fall within this range (`count_num`), it returns the difference between `end - start + 1` and `count_num`. Otherwise, it returns 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the difference between `end - start + 1` and `count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`. Otherwise, the program returns 0. `end - start + 1` is the total number of integers in the range from `start` to `end` (inclusive), and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that fall within this range.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
