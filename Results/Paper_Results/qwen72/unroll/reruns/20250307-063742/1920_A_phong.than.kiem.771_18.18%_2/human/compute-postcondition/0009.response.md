Output State: `n` is an integer input by the user, and 2 <= n <= 100; `start` is the maximum value of `v` for all `t == 1` inputs, or -1 if no such input exists; `end` is the minimum value of `v` for all `t == 2` inputs, or 1000000000.0 if no such input exists; `num` is a list containing all `v` values for which `t == 3`; `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`.
