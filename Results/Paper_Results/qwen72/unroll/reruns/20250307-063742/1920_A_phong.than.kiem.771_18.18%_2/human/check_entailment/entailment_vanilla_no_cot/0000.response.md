Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution for the problem described. It reads the number of constraints, processes each constraint to determine the valid range for `k`, and accounts for the constraints where `k` must not equal certain values. The logic for calculating the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints is sound and aligns with the problem requirements. The program also handles the case where no valid `k` exists (i.e., when `start > end`). Therefore, the program is correct.
