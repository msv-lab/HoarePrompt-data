Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
import math
import re

n = func_1()
ans = []
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
for i in range(n):
    ans.append(func_7())
for i in ans:
    print(i)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(isOne=False):
    if not isOne:
        return int(input())
    else:
        return 1
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is True, the function returns the integer value 1. If `isOne` is False, the function prompts the user to input an integer and returns that integer.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(space=True, to_int=True):
    line = input()
    if space:
        items = line.split()
    else:
        items = list(line)
    if to_int:
        return [int(i) for i in items]
    else:
        return items
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two boolean parameters, `space` and `to_int`. It reads an input string from the user. If `space` is `True`, it splits the string into a list of substrings based on spaces. If `space` is `False`, it converts the string into a list of individual characters. If `to_int` is `True`, it converts each element of the resulting list into an integer and returns the list of integers. If `to_int` is `False`, it returns the list of substrings or characters directly.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(arr, sym):
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
    return string
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a string `sym`. It returns a string where each integer in `arr` is converted to a string and concatenated with `sym`. If `arr` is not empty, the final character in the returned string will be `sym`. The original list `arr` and the string `sym` remain unchanged.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(string, substring):
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:
        indices.append(index)
        index = string.find(substring, index + 1)
    return indices
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts two parameters, `string` and `substring`, both of which are strings. It returns a list of integers representing the starting indices of all occurrences of `substring` within `string`. If `substring` is not found in `string`, the function returns an empty list. The original `string` and `substring` remain unchanged.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for (index, value) in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `element`. It returns a list of indices where the value in `arr` is equal to `element`. If `element` is not found in `arr`, the function returns an empty list. The function does not modify the input list `arr`.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(arr, index, value):
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
    return None
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts a list of lists `arr`, a non-negative integer `index`, and an integer `value`. It searches through `arr` for the first sub-list where the element at the specified `index` is equal to `value`. If such a sub-list is found, it returns that sub-list. If no such sub-list is found, it returns `None`. The state of `arr`, `index`, and `value` remains unchanged after the function concludes.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        (t, v) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
    if start > end:
        return 0
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` reads an integer `n` from user input, where `2 <= n <= 100`. It then processes `n` pairs of integers `(t, v)`. Based on the value of `t`, it updates `start` to the maximum `v` for `t == 1`, `end` to the minimum `v` for `t == 2`, and appends `v` to a list `num` for `t == 3`. After processing, it counts the number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive). If `start` is greater than `end`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]` and the count of elements in `num` that fall within this range, provided the total number of integers in the range is greater than or equal to the count. If this condition is not met, it returns 0. The values of `n`, `start`, `end`, and `num` remain unchanged after the function concludes.
