Functionality: ** The function `func_7` reads an integer `n` from user input, where `2 <= n <= 100`. It then processes `n` pairs of integers `(t, v)`. Based on the value of `t`, it updates `start` to the maximum `v` for `t == 1`, `end` to the minimum `v` for `t == 2`, and appends `v` to a list `num` for `t == 3`. After processing, it counts the number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive). If `start` is greater than `end`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]` and the count of elements in `num` that fall within this range, provided the total number of integers in the range is greater than or equal to the count. If this condition is not met, it returns 0. The values of `n`, `start`, `end`, and `num` remain unchanged after the function concludes. **
