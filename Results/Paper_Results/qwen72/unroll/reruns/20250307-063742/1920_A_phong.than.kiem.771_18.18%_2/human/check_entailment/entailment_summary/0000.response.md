### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from user input and returns it as an integer. It also has a conditional branch that returns 1 if `isOne` is `True`, but this branch is not used in the provided program.
   - **Correctness**: This function correctly reads the number of test cases and returns it.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers based on spaces. It is not used in the provided program.
   - **Correctness**: Not relevant to the problem, but the function itself is correct for its intended use.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function concatenates a list of integers into a string with a specified separator. It is not used in the provided program.
   - **Correctness**: Not relevant to the problem, but the function itself is correct for its intended use.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function finds all starting indices of a substring within a string. It is not used in the provided program.
   - **Correctness**: Not relevant to the problem, but the function itself is correct for its intended use.

5. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This function finds all indices of a specified element within a list. It is not used in the provided program.
   - **Correctness**: Not relevant to the problem, but the function itself is correct for its intended use.

6. **Function `func_6`**:
   - This function finds the first sub-list in a list of lists where the element at a specified index matches a given value. It is not used in the provided program.
   - **Correctness**: Not relevant to the problem, but the function itself is correct for its intended use.

7. **Function `func_7`**:
   - This function processes the constraints for a single test case. It initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1000000000.0, and reads `n` pairs of integers `(t, v)`.
   - For `t == 1`, it updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `v`.
   - For `t == 2`, it updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `v`.
   - For `t == 3`, it appends `v` to the list `num`.
   - After processing all constraints, it counts the number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it returns the number of integers in the range `[start, end]` minus the count of elements in `num` that fall within this range.
   - **Correctness**: This function correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. The logic for handling the constraints and counting the valid integers is sound.

### Main Program:
- The main program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1`.
- It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the results of each test case.
- For each test case, it calls `func_7` and appends the result to `ans`.
- Finally, it prints each result in `ans`.

### Conclusion:
- The main program and the `func_7` function together correctly solve the problem as described. The other functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`) are not used in the program but are correct for their intended purposes.
- The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
