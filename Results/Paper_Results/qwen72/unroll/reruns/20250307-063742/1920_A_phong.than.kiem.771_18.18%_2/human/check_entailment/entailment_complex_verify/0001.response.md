### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The initialization of `start` to -1 and `end` to 1000000000.0 is correct. This ensures that `start` and `end` are set to the most permissive values initially, which will be updated based on the constraints.

2. **Constraint Processing:**
   - The program correctly processes the constraints:
     - For `a == 1`, it updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `v`, ensuring that `k` must be at least `v`.
     - For `a == 2`, it updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `v`, ensuring that `k` must be at most `v`.
     - For `a == 3`, it appends `v` to the list `num`, ensuring that `k` must not be equal to `v`.

3. **Range Calculation:**
   - The program correctly checks if `start > end` and returns 0 if true, which handles the case where no valid integers exist.
   - It calculates the number of valid integers in the range `[start, end]` and subtracts the count of invalid integers in `num`. This is done using the formula `end - start + 1 - count_num`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no valid integers exist (`start > end`).
   - It correctly handles the case where the range is valid and there are no invalid integers to subtract.

5. **Overall Structure:**
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_7`.
   - The results are stored in the list `ans` and printed at the end.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

Final: **True**
