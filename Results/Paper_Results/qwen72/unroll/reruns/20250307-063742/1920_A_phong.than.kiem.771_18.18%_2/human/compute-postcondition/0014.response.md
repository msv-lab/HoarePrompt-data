Output State: **The program returns the difference between `end - start + 1` and `count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`. Otherwise, the program returns 0. `end - start + 1` is the total number of integers in the range from `start` to `end` (inclusive), and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that fall within this range.**
