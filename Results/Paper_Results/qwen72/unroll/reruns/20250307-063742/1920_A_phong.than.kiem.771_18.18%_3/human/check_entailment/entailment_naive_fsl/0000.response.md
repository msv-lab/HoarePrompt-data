Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in handling the constraints. Specifically, the function `func_7` does not correctly handle the case where the constraints of type 3 (k must be not equal to some integer x) are within the range defined by the constraints of type 1 and type 2. The program calculates the number of integers that are not equal to the values in `num` but does not account for the fact that these values might be outside the range `[start, end]`. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3
1 1
2 5
3 10
```
Here, the constraints are:
1. k must be greater than or equal to 1.
2. k must be less than or equal to 5.
3. k must not be equal to 10.

The correct output should be 5 (since k can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5), but the program will incorrectly output 4 because it tries to subtract 1 from the count even though 10 is outside the range [1, 5].
