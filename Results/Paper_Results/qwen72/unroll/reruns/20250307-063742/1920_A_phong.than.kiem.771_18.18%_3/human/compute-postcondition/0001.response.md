Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list.**

The code snippet `start = -1` does not change the value of `start` because it was already -1 in the initial state. The values of `n`, `end`, and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
