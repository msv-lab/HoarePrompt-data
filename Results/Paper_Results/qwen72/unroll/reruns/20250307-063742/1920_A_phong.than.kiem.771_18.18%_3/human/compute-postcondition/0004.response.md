To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the default behavior of `range(n)`.

The other variables (`start`, `end`, and `num`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for completeness, we can include their initial states as they are provided.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list**
