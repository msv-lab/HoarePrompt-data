The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `num`. For the loop to execute, the list `num` must contain at least one element. The state of `i` will be the first element of `num` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `start` is the highest value of `v` for which `t` was 1, `end` is the lowest value of `v` for which `t` was 2, `num` is a list containing all values of `v` for which `t` was 3 and must have at least one element, `count_num` is 0, `i` is the first element in `num`**
