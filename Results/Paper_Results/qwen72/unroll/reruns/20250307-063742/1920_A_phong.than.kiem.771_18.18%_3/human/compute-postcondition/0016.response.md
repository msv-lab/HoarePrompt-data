Functionality: ** The function `func_7` reads an integer `n` from the user and then reads `n` pairs of integers `(t, v)`. It updates `start` to the highest value of `v` where `t` is 1, `end` to the lowest value of `v` where `t` is 2, and appends `v` to the list `num` where `t` is 3. After processing all pairs, the function returns 0 if `start` is greater than `end`. Otherwise, it returns 0 if the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive) is greater than or equal to the range `end - start + 1`. If neither condition is met, it returns the difference `end - start + 1 - count_num`. The function does not modify `n`, `start`, `end`, or `num` after the initial processing. **
