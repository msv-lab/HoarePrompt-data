### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the user. It is used correctly in the main program to determine how many times the main loop should run.
   - The function is simple and works as expected.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is not used in the main program, so its correctness is irrelevant to the overall program.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is not used in the main program, so its correctness is irrelevant to the overall program.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function is not used in the main program, so its correctness is irrelevant to the overall program.

5. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This function is not used in the main program, so its correctness is irrelevant to the overall program.

6. **Function `func_6`**:
   - This function is not used in the main program, so its correctness is irrelevant to the overall program.

7. **Function `func_7`**:
   - This function is the core of the program and is responsible for processing each test case.
   - It reads the number of constraints `n` and then processes `n` pairs of integers `(t, v)`.
   - For type 1 constraints (`t == 1`), it updates `start` to the highest value of `v` where `k` must be greater than or equal to `v`.
   - For type 2 constraints (`t == 2`), it updates `end` to the lowest value of `v` where `k` must be less than or equal to `v`.
   - For type 3 constraints (`t == 3`), it appends `v` to the list `num`, which represents the values that `k` must not be equal to.
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `start` is greater than `end`. If so, it returns 0, which is correct because there are no integers that can satisfy the constraints.
   - It then counts the number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` and subtracts this count from the total number of integers in the range.
   - Finally, it returns the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.

### Overall Correctness:
- The main program correctly uses `func_1` to read the number of test cases and `func_7` to process each test case.
- `func_7` correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.
- The program does not use the other functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`), so their correctness is not relevant to the program's functionality.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the problem description.
