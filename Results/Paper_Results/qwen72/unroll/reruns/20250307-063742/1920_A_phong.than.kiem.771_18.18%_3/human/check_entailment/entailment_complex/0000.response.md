### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases**:
   - The main loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. This is handled correctly by the `func_1` function, which reads the number of test cases.
   - The `func_7` function is called for each test case, which processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k`.

2. **Constraints Processing**:
   - **Type 1 Constraints (k >= x)**: The `start` variable is updated to the maximum value of `x` from the constraints of type 1. This ensures that `k` must be at least `start`.
   - **Type 2 Constraints (k <= x)**: The `end` variable is updated to the minimum value of `x` from the constraints of type 2. This ensures that `k` must be at most `end`.
   - **Type 3 Constraints (k != x)**: The `num` list is populated with all values of `x` from the constraints of type 3. These are the values that `k` must not be equal to.

3. **Validation and Calculation**:
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both the minimum and maximum constraints, so the function correctly returns 0.
   - The function then counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`. This count is stored in `count_num`.
   - The final result is calculated as `end - start + 1 - count_num`, which represents the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]` minus the number of integers that are not allowed (i.e., those in `num`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `start` and `end` are equal, and there are no values in `num` that fall within this range.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where `start` and `end` are such that the range is empty (i.e., `start > end`), returning 0 as expected.

5. **Function Usage**:
   - The `func_7` function is used correctly in the main loop to process each test case and append the result to the `ans` list.
   - The `ans` list is then printed, one result per line, which matches the expected output format.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. The logic and flow of the program align with the problem description and handle all edge cases appropriately.
