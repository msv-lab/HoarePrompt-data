### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and then reads `n` lines of constraints. This is correctly handled in the `func_7` function.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - The program initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to \(10^9\).
   - It iterates through each constraint:
     - If the constraint type is 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `x`. This ensures that `start` is the highest lower bound.
     - If the constraint type is 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `x`. This ensures that `end` is the lowest upper bound.
     - If the constraint type is 3 (k must not be equal to x), it appends `x` to the list `num`. This correctly collects all the excluded numbers.

3. **Range Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `start` is greater than `end`. If this is the case, it returns 0 because no integer can satisfy the constraints. This is a correct check to ensure the range is valid.

4. **Counting Excluded Numbers**:
   - The program iterates through the list `num` and counts how many of these numbers fall within the range `[start, end]`.
   - It then subtracts this count from the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]`.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the number of valid integers by subtracting the count of excluded numbers from the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]`.
   - The condition `if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0` is redundant because if `count_num` is greater than `end - start + 1`, the result will be negative, and the program will return 0, which is the correct behavior.

### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function summary for `func_7` is accurate and matches the implementation.
- The function correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It processes the constraints, validates the range, and calculates the number of valid integers. There are no logical errors or issues with the implementation.
