Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list.**

The code snippet `num = []` reassigns the variable `num` to an empty list, which was already an empty list in the initial state. Therefore, the state of `num` remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `start`, and `end`) are not affected by this code.
