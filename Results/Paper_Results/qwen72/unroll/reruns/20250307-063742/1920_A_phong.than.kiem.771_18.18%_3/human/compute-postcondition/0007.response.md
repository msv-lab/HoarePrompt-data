Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `start` is the highest value of `v` for which `t` was 1, `end` is the lowest value of `v` for which `t` was 2, `num` is a list containing all values of `v` for which `t` was 3, `count_num` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes `count_num` to 0.
- The values of `n`, `start`, `end`, and `num` remain unchanged from the initial state.
- If no `t` was 1, `start` remains -1.
- If no `t` was 2, `end` remains 1000000000.0.
- If no `t` was 3, `num` remains an empty list.
