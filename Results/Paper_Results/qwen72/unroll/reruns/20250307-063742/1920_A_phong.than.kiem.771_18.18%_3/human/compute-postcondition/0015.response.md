The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It initializes `start` to -1, `end` to 1000000000.0, and `num` to an empty list. The function returns 0 if the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive) is greater than or equal to the range `end - start + 1`. Otherwise, it returns the difference `end - start + 1 - count_num`, where `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the specified range.
