Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the number of constraints, processes each constraint to determine the valid range for `k`, and then checks for any `k` values that must be excluded. The final count of valid `k` values is computed by subtracting the number of excluded values from the total number of integers in the valid range. The program handles all the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem description.
