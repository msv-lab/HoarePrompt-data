Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list.**

The code snippet does not change any of the variables, as it only reassigns a value to `end` that is already the same as its initial value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
