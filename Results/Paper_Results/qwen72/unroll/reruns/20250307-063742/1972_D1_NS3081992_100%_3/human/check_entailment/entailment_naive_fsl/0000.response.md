Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The function `func_15()` is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the logic in `func_15()` does not correctly implement this condition.

The function `func_15()` uses a loop to count pairs, but it does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be counting pairs based on a different, incorrect condition.

For example, consider the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\). The correct pairs should be \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\), which gives a total of 3 pairs. However, the function `func_15()` does not correctly count these pairs. The loop in `func_15()` is not designed to check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), and thus it will not produce the correct result for this input.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
