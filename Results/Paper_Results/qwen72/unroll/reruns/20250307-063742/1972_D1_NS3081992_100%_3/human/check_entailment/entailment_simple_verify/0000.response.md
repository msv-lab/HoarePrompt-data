Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Problem Condition**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_15()`**:
   - The function `func_15()` uses a loop to count pairs, but the loop does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The loop in `func_15()` is:
     ```python
     while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
         ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
         i += 1
     ```
   - This loop is incrementing `ans` based on the condition \((n + i) // (i * i)\), which does not correspond to the problem's requirement. It is counting pairs based on a different, incorrect condition.

3. **Example Input**:
   - For the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the correct pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\), which gives a total of 3 pairs.
   - However, the function `func_15()` does not correctly count these pairs. The loop in `func_15()` will not produce the correct result for this input because it is not checking the required condition.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - A correct implementation would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done using nested loops and the `math.gcd` function.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_15()` does not correctly solve the problem, and the program is therefore incorrect.

Final: **False**
