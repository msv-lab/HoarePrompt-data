The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges. It returns a tuple of three values. If `b` is 0, it returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple (y, x - a // b * y, g), where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the values from the recursive call. The final state of the program is that it has computed and returned these three values, which are derived from the recursive process.
