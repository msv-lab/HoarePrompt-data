### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, `func_15()` is called to compute the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

2. **Function `func_15`:**
   - This function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input using `func_7()`.
   - It then iterates over `i` from `1` to `m` (or until `i * i > n + i`), and for each `i`, it calculates `(n + i) // (i * i)` and adds it to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Function `func_16`:**
   - This function is the main function that processes all test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_10()`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_15()` and prints the result.

4. **Mathematical Condition:**
   - The problem requires counting pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The function `func_15` attempts to solve this by iterating over `i` and calculating `(n + i) // (i * i)`. However, this approach does not directly address the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

5. **Correctness of the Condition:**
   - The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
     - `a + b = k * b * gcd(a, b)` for some integer `k`.
     - This simplifies to `a / gcd(a, b) + b / gcd(a, b) = k * b`.
     - Let `g = gcd(a, b)`, then `a = g * a'` and `b = g * b'` where `gcd(a', b') = 1`.
     - The condition becomes `a' + b' = k * b'`, which implies `a' + 1 = k * b'`.
     - Therefore, `a'` must be of the form `k * b' - 1` for some integer `k`.

6. **Implementation Flaw:**
   - The function `func_15` does not correctly implement the above condition. It calculates `(n + i) // (i * i)` which does not align with the required condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The correct approach would involve iterating over possible values of `b` and for each `b`, finding all `a` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_15` does not correctly implement the required condition for the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False****
