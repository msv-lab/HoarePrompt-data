### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_15()` is called `t` times inside `func_16()`, and for each call, it reads `n` and `m` from the input using `func_7()`.

2. **Logic of `func_15()`:**
   - The function `func_15()` is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The loop in `func_15()` iterates over `i` from 1 to `m` or until \(i^2 > n + i\).
   - The expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) is used to count the number of valid pairs for each `i`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - This implies that \(a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)\).
   - For \(a\) to be an integer, \(k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1\) must be an integer, and \(a\) must be within the range \(1 \le a \le n\).
   - The loop in `func_15()` is intended to count the valid pairs, but the logic used is not correct. Specifically, the expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the test case \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\), the function should return 14, but the current logic does not correctly compute this.
   - The loop in `func_15()` does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The logic in `func_15()` is incorrect and does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
