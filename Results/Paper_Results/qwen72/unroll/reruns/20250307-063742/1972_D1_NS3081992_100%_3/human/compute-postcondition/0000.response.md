To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the result of `func_10()`. The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a positive integer (greater than 0).

Since the state before the loop starts indicates that none of the variables in the function signature are used, and the function relies on external functions `func_10` and `func_15`, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a value that allows the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `_` is 0 (or not initialized, as it is a throwaway variable)**
