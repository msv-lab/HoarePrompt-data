Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The input handling is overly complex and includes multiple functions for reading input, which is not necessary for this problem. The use of `sys.stdin.buffer.readline()` is not standard for reading input in Python and can be simplified using `input()`.

2. **Main Logic**: The main logic in `func_15()` is incorrect. The condition `i * i <= n + i` and the calculation `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` do not correctly address the problem of finding pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **GCD Calculation**: The problem requires the calculation of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\), but the provided program does not use the GCD function anywhere. The function `func_13()` is an implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the GCD and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, but it is not used in the main logic.

4. **Output Handling**: The output handling in `func_16()` is also overly complex. It can be simplified to directly print the result of `func_15()`.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to:

1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read \(n\) and \(m\).
3. Iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs and print the result for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program correctly reads the input, calculates the number of valid pairs, and prints the results. However, it may not be efficient enough for the upper limits of \(n\) and \(m\) (up to \(2 \cdot 10^6\)). For such large inputs, a more optimized approach is needed, but the logic is fundamentally correct.
