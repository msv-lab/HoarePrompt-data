The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, and three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` and `m` are positive. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `a`, and for each element that is less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and that element. After the iteration, if `k` is greater than or equal to 0, the function returns 1. If `k` is less than 0, the function returns -1. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
