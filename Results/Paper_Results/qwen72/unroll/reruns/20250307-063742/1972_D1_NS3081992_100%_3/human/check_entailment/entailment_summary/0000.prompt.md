Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    func_16()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads an integer value from the standard input and returns this integer value.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads a single line of space-separated integers from the standard input and returns an iterator that yields each integer. The function does not modify any external variables or state. After the function concludes, the iterator can be used to access the integers one by one.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function reads a line of input from standard input, splits the line into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` and returns a list containing `rows_number` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_3()`. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string. The function does not modify any external variables or state. After the function concludes, the user will have a string that represents the input line with trailing whitespace removed.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function reads a line from standard input, decodes it from bytes to a string, and strips the trailing newline character. It returns the resulting string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers. The integers are derived from a string input provided by the user, where each integer is separated by spaces in the input string. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a non-negative integer `rows` and returns a list of length `rows`, where each element is the result of calling `func_7()`. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` reads user input and returns it as a string. It does not accept any parameters and has no side effects on external variables. After the function concludes, the program state is unchanged except for the returned user input string.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` reads an integer value from the user and returns this integer value. After the function concludes, the program has no other side effects, and the state of the program remains unchanged except for the returned integer.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user and returns a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by whitespace. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer key `da` from `d`, and a list `rank`. It returns 1 if the list associated with the key `da` in `d` has only one element, indicating no further processing is needed. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed (as indicated by `processing`), and returns the minimum value of these recursive calls plus 1. Additionally, it updates `rank[da - 1]` to this minimum value plus 1. The `processing` list is reset to its initial state (all 0s) by the end of the function, while `rank` and `d` remain unchanged except for the update to `rank[da - 1]`.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges. It returns a tuple of three values. If `b` is 0, it returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple (y, x - a // b * y, g), where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the values from the recursive call. The final state of the program is that it has computed and returned these three values, which are derived from the recursive process.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, and three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` and `m` are positive. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `a`, and for each element that is less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and that element. After the iteration, if `k` is greater than or equal to 0, the function returns 1. If `k` is less than 0, the function returns -1. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` accepts no parameters and returns an integer value. It computes the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` starting from `1` up to the smallest integer `i - 1` where `i * i > n + i`, or up to `m` if that condition is not met, and then returns this sum minus `1`. The function modifies the variables `n`, `m`, `i`, and `ans` internally, but these changes do not affect the external state of the program.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It executes a loop `func_10()` times, and during each iteration, it prints the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline. The state of any external variables or the program outside the function remains unchanged.
