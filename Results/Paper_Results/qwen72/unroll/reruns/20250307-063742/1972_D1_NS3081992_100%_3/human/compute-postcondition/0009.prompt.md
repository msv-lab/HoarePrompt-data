You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers, processing is a list of integers of length equal to the number of keys in d, initialized to 0, da is an integer key present in d, and rank is a list of integers of the same length as processing, initialized to 0.
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: d is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers, processing is a list of integers of length equal to the number of keys in d, initialized to 0, da is an integer key present in d, rank is a list of integers of the same length as processing, initialized to 0, tmp is 1000000000, and the list of integers associated with the key `da` in dictionary `d` has a length greater than 1.
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: The `processing` list will have the same values as it did initially (all 0s), and `tmp` will be the minimum value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was 0. The `rank` list and the dictionary `d` will remain unchanged.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was 0, and `rank[da - 1]` is now `tmp + 1`. The `processing` list, `rank` list, and dictionary `d` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer key `da` from `d`, and a list `rank`. It returns 1 if no further processing is needed. Otherwise, it returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by recursively calling `func_12` for each `di` in `d[da]` that has not been processed, and updates `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1.

Case_2: The program returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was 0, and `rank[da - 1]` is now `tmp + 1`. The `processing` list, `rank` list, and dictionary `d` remain unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
