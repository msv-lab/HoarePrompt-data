Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Let's break down the function to understand why it is incorrect:

### Function `func_15()` Analysis:
```python
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input using `func_7()`.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Loop and Condition**:
   - The function uses a loop that iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) or until \(i^2 > n + i\).
   - Inside the loop, it calculates \((n + i) // (i * i)\) and adds this value to `ans`.
   - The loop condition \(i \le m\) and \(i * i \le n + i\) is not directly related to the problem's condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns `ans - 1` after the loop.
   - This is also not directly related to the problem's condition.

### Correct Condition Analysis:
The problem requires counting pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

To correctly implement this, the function should:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
2. For each pair \((a, b)\), compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the pairs that satisfy this condition.

### Example Verification:
For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
- The correct pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).

Let's verify the function `func_15()` with this input:
- \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)
- The loop will run for \(i = 1\) and \(i = 2\) (since \(i = 3\) would make \(i^2 = 9\) which is greater than \(n + i = 5\)).
- For \(i = 1\):
  - \((n + 1) // (1 * 1) = 3\)
- For \(i = 2\):
  - \((n + 2) // (2 * 2) = 1\)
- `ans` will be \(3 + 1 = 4\)
- The function returns \(4 - 1 = 3\).

While the function returns the correct number of pairs for this specific example, it is not a general solution. The loop and the condition used in `func_15()` do not correctly capture the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The loop and the condition used are not aligned with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
