### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it uses `func_7()` to read the values of `n` and `m`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function `func_15()` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for a given `n` and `m`.
   - The logic inside `func_15()` is as follows:
     - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
     - It iterates while `i` is less than or equal to `m` and `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`.
     - For each valid `i`, it adds `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Mathematical Analysis**:
   - The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
     - \( a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) for some integer \( k \).
     - This implies \( a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b \).
     - Simplifying, \( a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1) \).
     - For \( a \) to be a positive integer, \( k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1 \) must be a positive integer, which means \( k \cdot \gcd(a, b) \geq 2 \).

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The loop in `func_15()` runs while `i * i <= n + i`, which ensures that the number of iterations is manageable.
   - The expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` is used to count the number of valid `a` values for a given `i`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program writes the result of `func_15()` for each test case to the standard output.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` and `m` are both 1 correctly, as it returns 1.
   - The program also handles larger values of `n` and `m` as shown in the example.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions. The mathematical reasoning and the implementation are consistent with the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
