### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_15()` does not implement the required logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the logic in `func_15()`:

1. **Loop Initialization**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and continues while `i <= m` and `i * i <= n + i`.
   - This loop condition is not directly related to the problem's requirements.

2. **Counting Pairs**:
   - Inside the loop, the function increments `ans` by \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
   - This calculation is not based on the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `ans - 1`.

### Analysis of the Condition \(a + b\) is a Multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\):

To correctly count the pairs, we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be expressed as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

This simplifies to:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot d \]
where \(d = \gcd(a, b)\).

Since \(d\) divides both \(a\) and \(b\), we can write:
\[ a = d \cdot a' \]
\[ b = d \cdot b' \]
where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\).

Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[ d \cdot a' + d \cdot b' = k \cdot d \cdot b' \]
\[ a' + b' = k \cdot b' \]
\[ a' = (k - 1) \cdot b' \]

This means \(a'\) must be a multiple of \(b'\). Since \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\), \(b'\) must be 1, and thus \(a'\) must be \(k - 1\).

Therefore, \(a\) must be of the form \(d \cdot (k - 1)\) and \(b\) must be \(d\).

### Correct Implementation:

A correct implementation would involve iterating over all possible values of \(b\) and for each \(b\), finding the valid values of \(a\) that satisfy the condition. This can be done by iterating over all possible values of \(d\) (the gcd) and checking if \(a\) and \(b\) are valid.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the required logic. The loop and the counting mechanism are not aligned with the problem's conditions. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
