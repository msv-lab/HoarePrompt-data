The function `func` accepts parameters `n` and a list of `n-1` edges, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and each edge is a tuple (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. The function also accepts a starting node `u_1` which is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. The tree represented by these edges has exactly two leaves. The function returns the other leaf node of the tree when starting from `u_1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, a list of `n-1` edges representing a tree with exactly two leaves, and a starting node `u_1`. It returns the other leaf node of the tree.**
