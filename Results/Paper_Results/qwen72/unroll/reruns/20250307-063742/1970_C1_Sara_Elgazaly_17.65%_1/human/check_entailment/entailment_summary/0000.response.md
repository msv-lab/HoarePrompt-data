### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Tree Construction:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of nodes `x` and the number of rounds `y` (which is always 1) from the input.
   - It then reads `x - 1` pairs of integers, which represent the edges of the tree, and constructs an adjacency list using `defaultdict(list)`.

2. **Tree Traversal:**
   - The program starts from node `x` (the initial node where the stone is placed) and traverses the tree to find the other leaf node.
   - It uses a while loop to move the stone from the current node to an inactive neighbor. The loop continues until it reaches a leaf node.

3. **Move Counting:**
   - The variable `s` is used to keep track of the player who will make the next move. It toggles between `True` and `False` with each move.
   - The program correctly toggles `s` each time a move is made and one more time after the loop to account for the final move.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'Hermione' if the number of moves is even (i.e., `s` is `True`), and 'Ron' if the number of moves is odd (i.e., `s` is `False`).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program assumes that the tree has exactly two leaves, which is guaranteed by the problem statement.
   - The program does not handle multiple rounds (since `t` is always 1), but this is not a requirement for the easy version of the problem.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of moves required to reach the other leaf node. It follows the rules of the game and the problem constraints.

**Correctness: True**
