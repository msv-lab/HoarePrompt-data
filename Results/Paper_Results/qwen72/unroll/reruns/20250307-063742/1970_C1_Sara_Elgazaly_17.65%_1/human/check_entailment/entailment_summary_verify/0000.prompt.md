You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

Examples

Input

    3 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 1
    
    3

Output

    Ron
    
Input

    5 1
    
    1 2
    
    2 3
    
    3 4
    
    4 5
    
    5

Output

    Hermione

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    lst = defaultdict(list)
    for _ in range(x - 1):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        lst[a].append(b)
        lst[b].append(a)
    s = True
    while lst[x] != []:
        while lst[x]:
            y = lst[x].pop()
            if lst[y] != []:
                x = y
                break
        s = not s
    s = not s
    print('Hermione' if s else 'Ron')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `x` and an integer `y` from the input, then reads `x - 1` pairs of integers representing edges of a tree. It processes the tree to determine the other leaf node starting from node `x`. The function prints 'Hermione' if the other leaf node is reached after an even number of steps, and 'Ron' if it is reached after an odd number of steps. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it determines the winner of the game. The program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the starting node is a leaf node. In such a case, the player who starts (Ron) will always lose because there are no inactive neighbors to move to. However, the program does not account for this and may return an incorrect result.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
1
```
The tree is a simple path: 1 - 3 - 2. If the stone starts at node 1, which is a leaf, Ron cannot make a move and loses. The program, however, does not correctly handle this case and may return "Ron" instead of "Hermione".
