The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the variable `x`. The loop will execute if `x - 1` is greater than 0. This means `x` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once. The state of `n`, the tree, `u_1`, `y`, and `lst` do not affect the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, the tree is represented by a list of n-1 edges where each edge is a tuple (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the tree has exactly two leaves, the starting node `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is greater than 1, `y` is an integer provided by the user, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists, `_` is 0**
