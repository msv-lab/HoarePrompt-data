Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer from the standard input and then calls the `solve` function that many times. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `solve` function has been executed a number of times equal to the integer read from the standard input, and the state of any variables outside the function remains unchanged. **
