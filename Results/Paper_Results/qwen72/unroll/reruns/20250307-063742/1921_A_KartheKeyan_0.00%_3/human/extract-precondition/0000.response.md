Precondition: **The function should take an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should take four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The coordinates are given in random order, and it is guaranteed that the points form a square with a positive area.**
