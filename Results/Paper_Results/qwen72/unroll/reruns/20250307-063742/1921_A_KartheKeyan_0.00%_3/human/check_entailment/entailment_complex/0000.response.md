Reasoning:

The program is intended to calculate the area of a square given its four corner coordinates. The coordinates are guaranteed to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and the area is strictly greater than 0. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)` representing the coordinates of the square's corners.

2. **Coordinate Sorting**:
   - The coordinates are stored in a list `coord` and then sorted. Sorting the coordinates ensures that the points are in a specific order, which is useful for calculating the side lengths of the square.

3. **Calculating Side Lengths**:
   - The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of adjacent points (after sorting) to determine the side length of the square.
   - `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second points.
   - `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth points.

4. **Calculating the Area**:
   - The area of the square is calculated by taking the square root of `p1` and `p2`, multiplying them, and then taking the absolute value. However, this step is incorrect because the area of a square is simply the side length squared. Since `p1` and `p2` should both represent the same side length squared, the correct area should be `p1` or `p2`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated area for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Area Calculation**:
  - The program uses `res = abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, which is unnecessary and incorrect. Since `p1` and `p2` should be equal (both representing the side length squared), the area should simply be `p1` or `p2`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        
        for i in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        coord = sorted(coord)
        
        side_length_squared = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
        
        area = side_length_squared
        
        print(area)
        
        n -= 1
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- **Side Length Calculation**:
  - We calculate the side length squared using the distance between the first and second points after sorting.
- **Area Calculation**:
  - The area of the square is simply the side length squared, so we print `side_length_squared`.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it uses an unnecessary and incorrect method to calculate the area of the square. The corrected code directly calculates the side length squared and prints it as the area, which is the correct approach.

Correctness: **False**
