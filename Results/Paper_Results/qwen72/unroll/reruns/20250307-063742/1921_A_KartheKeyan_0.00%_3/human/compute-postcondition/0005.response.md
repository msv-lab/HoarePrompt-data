Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts four pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)` (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The function calculates and prints the area of the square for each test case. After processing all test cases, the value of `t` is 0, and the function concludes without returning any value. The coordinates of the corners of the square and the initial value of `t` remain unchanged. **
