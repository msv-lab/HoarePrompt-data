The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is truthy (i.e., non-zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is the input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero. Since `n` is an integer, it can be any non-zero value to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **The function takes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `l` (-1000 ≤ l ≤ 1000) and calculates `s` as `(l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`. The value of `s` is printed for each test case. After all test cases are processed, `n` must be a non-zero integer. The coordinates of the corners of the square and the initial value of `t` are not affected.**
