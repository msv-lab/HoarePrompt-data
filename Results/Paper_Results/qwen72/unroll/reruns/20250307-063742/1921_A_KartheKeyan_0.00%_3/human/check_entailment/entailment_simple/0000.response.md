### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates and stores them in a list `coord`.

2. **Sorting Coordinates**:
   - The coordinates are sorted. Sorting the coordinates ensures that the points are in a consistent order, which is necessary for the subsequent calculations.

3. **Calculating Side Length**:
   - The function calculates the squared distance between the first two points (`p1`) and the last two points (`p2`).
   - The squared distance is used to avoid floating-point precision issues when calculating the side length of the square.

4. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area of the square is calculated by taking the square root of `p1` and `p2`, multiplying them, and taking the absolute value. However, this step is unnecessary because `p1` and `p2` should be equal (since they represent the squared lengths of the sides of the square), and the area should simply be the square of the side length.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the calculated area for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Area Calculation**:
  - The area of the square should be the square of the side length. The side length can be derived from the difference in either the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates of adjacent points.
  - The current implementation calculates the area as `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, which is incorrect. It should be `p1` (or `p2`, since they are equal) because `p1` and `p2` are the squared side lengths.

### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        
        for i in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        coord = sorted(coord)
        
        # Calculate the squared side length
        side_squared = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
        
        # The area of the square is the side length squared
        area = side_squared
        
        print(area)
        
        n -= 1
```

### Conclusion:
- The original program is incorrect because it uses an unnecessary and incorrect method to calculate the area of the square.

### Correctness:
**False**
