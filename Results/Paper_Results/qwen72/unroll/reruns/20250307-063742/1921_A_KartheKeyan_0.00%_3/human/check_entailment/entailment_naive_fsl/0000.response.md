Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**
The program provided does not correctly compute the area of the square in all potential cases. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
9
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3.0
```

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the area. It sorts the coordinates and then calculates the distance between two points, which may not necessarily be the side length of the square. The correct approach would be to find the unique x and y coordinates, and then compute the area as the square of the difference between the unique x coordinates (or y coordinates, since the sides are parallel to the axes).

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract unique x and y coordinates
        x_coords = sorted(set([point[0] for point in coord]))
        y_coords = sorted(set([point[1] for point in coord]))
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = x_coords[1] - x_coords[0]
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)
        n -= 1
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly identifies the side length of the square and computes the area accurately.
