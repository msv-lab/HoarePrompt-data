Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding the area of a square given its four corner coordinates. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Sorting Coordinates**: The program sorts the coordinates, but this does not guarantee that the points are in the correct order to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Sorting the points can lead to incorrect pairings of points when calculating the side lengths.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points (p1 and p2) and then takes the square root of these distances to compute the area. This approach is incorrect because:
   - The side length of the square should be the same for all sides.
   - The correct way to calculate the side length is to find the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent points.

3. **Area Calculation**: The area of the square should be the side length squared. The current implementation multiplies the square roots of two distances, which is not the correct way to calculate the area.

4. **Redundant Code**: The commented-out section at the beginning of the function is irrelevant to the problem and should be removed for clarity.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract unique x and y coordinates
        x_coords = sorted(set(point[0] for point in coord))
        y_coords = sorted(set(point[1] for point in coord))
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = abs(x_coords[1] - x_coords[0])  # or abs(y_coords[1] - y_coords[0])
        
        # Calculate the area of the square
        area = side_length ** 2
        
        print(area)
        t -= 1
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Extract Unique Coordinates**: By extracting unique x and y coordinates, we ensure that we have the correct side lengths of the square.
2. **Calculate Side Length**: The side length is the absolute difference between the first and second unique x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, since the square is aligned with the axes).
3. **Calculate Area**: The area is the side length squared.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned. The corrected program should work correctly for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
