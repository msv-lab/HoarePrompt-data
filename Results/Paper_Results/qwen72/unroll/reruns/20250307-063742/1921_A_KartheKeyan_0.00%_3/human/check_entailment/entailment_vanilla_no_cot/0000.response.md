Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. Here are the issues:

1. The program sorts the coordinates, which can lead to incorrect pairings of points for calculating the side length of the square. Sorting the coordinates may not preserve the correct order of the points that form the sides of the square.

2. The calculation of the side length of the square is incorrect. The program calculates the Euclidean distance between two points, but since the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length should be the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates of adjacent points.

3. The area of the square should be the square of the side length, but the program incorrectly multiplies the square roots of two distances and then takes the absolute value, which is not the correct way to calculate the area.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract unique x and y coordinates
        x_coords = sorted(set(point[0] for point in coord))
        y_coords = sorted(set(point[1] for point in coord))
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = x_coords[1] - x_coords[0]  # or y_coords[1] - y_coords[0]
        
        # Calculate the area of the square
        area = side_length ** 2
        
        print(area)
        n -= 1
```

This version correctly calculates the area of the square by:
- Extracting unique x and y coordinates.
- Calculating the side length as the difference between the first two unique x or y coordinates (since the sides are parallel to the axes).
- Squaring the side length to get the area.
