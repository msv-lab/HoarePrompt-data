The function `func` accepts an integer `t` where `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts four pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)` where `-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000`, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The coordinates are given in random order, and it is guaranteed that the points form a square with a positive area. The function returns the area of the square for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts four pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)` (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It returns the area of the square for each test case.**
