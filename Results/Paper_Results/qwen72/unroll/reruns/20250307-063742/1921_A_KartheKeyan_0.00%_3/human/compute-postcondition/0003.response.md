Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the value of `n` is 0. The variables `coord` and `res` are reset to their initial states (empty list and 0, respectively) at the beginning of each iteration, so they do not retain any values after the loop. The coordinates of the corners of the square and the initial value of `t` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, and after each iteration, `n` is decremented by 1.
- Once the loop finishes, `n` will be 0.
- Inside the loop, `coord` and `res` are initialized at the start of each iteration and are not retained after the iteration ends.
- The coordinates of the corners of the square and the initial value of `t` are not modified by the loop, so they remain the same as they were before the loop started.
