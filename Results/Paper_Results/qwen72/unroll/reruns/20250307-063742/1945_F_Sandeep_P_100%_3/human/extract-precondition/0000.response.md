It seems there is a mismatch between the provided problem description and the function signature. The function `decorating_function` is a decorator function, which is not directly related to the problem of helping Kirill gather mushrooms to brew an elixir. Decorators are used to modify or enhance functions in Python, and the provided function does not seem to solve any part of the problem described.

However, if we were to extract a precondition based on the function signature provided, it would be:

Precondition: **user_function is a callable function.**

This precondition indicates that `user_function` must be a function that can be called, which is a typical requirement for a decorator function. However, this does not contribute to solving the problem of finding the maximum strength of the elixir and the minimum number of mushrooms needed. If you have a specific function related to the problem, please provide it, and I will help you extract the appropriate precondition.
