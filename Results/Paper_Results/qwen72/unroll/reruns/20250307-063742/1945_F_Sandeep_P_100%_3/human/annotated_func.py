#State of the program right berfore the function call: fillvalue is a string or any value that can be used as a fill value for a recursive call.
def func_1(fillvalue):
    """Decorator to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call."""
    return decorating_function
    #The program returns the `decorating_function`, which is a function that has not been defined or modified in the provided code snippet.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `fillvalue` and returns a function `decorating_function`. The `decorating_function` is not defined or modified within the provided code snippet, so its behavior and purpose are unknown. The function does not modify the `fillvalue` or any other state.
