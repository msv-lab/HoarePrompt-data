Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem description, assuming that the input is valid as specified. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, and then reads the list of chosen vertices `arr`.
3. **Output Calculation**: The program prints `x - 2` for each test case. This is correct because in a regular polygon with `n` sides, if `x` vertices are chosen, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using these vertices is `x - 2`. This is a well-known property of triangulation in polygons.

Given that `y = 0` in this version of the problem, you cannot choose any additional vertices, so the solution is based solely on the vertices Bessie has already chosen. The program correctly implements this logic and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
