Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` integers. It then prints `x - 2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the value of `t` is 0, and the function has completed its execution. The function does not return any value. **
