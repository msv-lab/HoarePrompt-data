### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has chosen `x` vertices.
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the chosen vertices.
   - The maximum number of additional vertices we can choose is `y`, but in this problem, `y` is always 0, meaning we cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - To form a triangle, we need 3 vertices.
   - Given `x` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles we can form is `x - 2`. This is because each additional vertex after the first two can form one new triangle with the previous two vertices.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It then reads the `x` chosen vertices.
   - The program prints `x - 2` for each test case.

4. **Validation**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The logic of printing `x - 2` is correct based on the problem's constraints and the key insight that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles is `x - 2`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `x` is 2, correctly printing `0` (since no triangles can be formed with only 2 vertices).
   - The program also handles the case where `x` is greater than 2, correctly printing the number of triangles.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.
