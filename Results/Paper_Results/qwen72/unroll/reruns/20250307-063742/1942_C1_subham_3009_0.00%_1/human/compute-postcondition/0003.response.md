Output State: **The value of `t` is 0, and the loop has printed `x - 2` for each test case.**

### Explanation:
- The loop starts with `t` being a positive integer (the number of test cases).
- For each iteration of the loop, `t` is decremented by 1.
- Inside the loop, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are read from the input, and a list `arr` of `x` integers is also read.
- The loop then prints `x - 2` for each test case.
- After all iterations, `t` will be 0 because the loop continues until `t` is no longer greater than 0.
- The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are re-assigned in each iteration, but their final values after the loop are not relevant to the output state, as they are overwritten in each iteration.
- The output state is simply that the loop has completed all its iterations and `t` is now 0, with `x - 2` printed for each test case.
