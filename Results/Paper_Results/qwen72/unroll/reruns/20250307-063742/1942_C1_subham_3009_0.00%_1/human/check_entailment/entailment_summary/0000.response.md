Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the vertices chosen by Bessie and any additional vertices you can choose. Given the constraint \( y = 0 \), you cannot choose any additional vertices, so you must work only with the \( x \) vertices Bessie has chosen.

For a regular polygon with \( n \) sides, if \( x \) vertices are chosen, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using these \( x \) vertices is \( x - 2 \). This is a well-known result in combinatorial geometry: any convex polygon with \( x \) vertices can be triangulated into \( x - 2 \) non-intersecting triangles.

The program reads the input correctly and processes each test case by printing \( x - 2 \). This matches the expected output for the given problem constraints and examples.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
