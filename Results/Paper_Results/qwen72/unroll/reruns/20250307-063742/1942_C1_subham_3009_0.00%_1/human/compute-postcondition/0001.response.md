Output State: **The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving a regular polygon with `n` sides, where `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and Bessie has chosen `x` vertices, where `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is fixed at 0. The vertices chosen by Bessie are represented by a list of `x` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `t` is assigned the value of the integer input provided.**
