The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases involving a regular polygon. It accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, it accepts:
  - `n`: An integer representing the number of sides of the regular polygon, where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
  - `x`: An integer representing the number of vertices chosen by Bessie, where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5).
  - `vertices`: A list of `x` distinct integers, each ranging from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices chosen by Bessie.
- `y`: A fixed integer value set to 0.

The function returns a list of results, one for each test case. Each result is a string indicating whether the chosen vertices can form a valid polygon with the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (number of sides of a regular polygon), an integer `x` (number of vertices chosen by Bessie), and a list of `x` distinct integers (vertices chosen by Bessie). It returns a list of strings, where each string indicates whether the chosen vertices can form a valid polygon for the corresponding test case.**
