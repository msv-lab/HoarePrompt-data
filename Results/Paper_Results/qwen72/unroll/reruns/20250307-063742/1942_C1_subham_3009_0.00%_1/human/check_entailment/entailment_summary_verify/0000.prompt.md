You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            arr = input().split()
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            print(x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` integers. It then prints `x - 2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the value of `t` is 0, and the function has completed its execution. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program always prints `x - 2` as the result, which is incorrect for several reasons:

1. **Handling of y = 0**: The problem specifies that `y = 0`, meaning you cannot choose any additional vertices. The program does not consider this constraint and simply outputs `x - 2`.

2. **Maximizing Triangles**: The program does not attempt to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. It simply subtracts 2 from the number of chosen vertices, which is not a valid approach for determining the maximum number of triangles.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if Bessie has chosen all the vertices (i.e., `x = n`), the program will still output `x - 2`, which is incorrect. In this case, the number of triangles should be `n - 2`.

4. **Input Parsing**: The program does not handle the input correctly. It reads the vertices as strings and converts them to integers, but it does not sort or process them to ensure they are in the correct order for forming triangles.

A correct solution would need to consider the vertices chosen by Bessie, sort them, and then determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using these vertices. The current program fails to do this and thus is incorrect.
