Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not correctly handle cases where `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal (e.g., `0 0 0` or `1 1 1`). According to the problem description, if all three digits are the same, the output should be "NONE". However, the current program will incorrectly output "none" for such cases, which is not in the correct format as specified in the problem description. Additionally, the program generates random inputs instead of reading them from the input, which does not follow the problem's input requirements.
