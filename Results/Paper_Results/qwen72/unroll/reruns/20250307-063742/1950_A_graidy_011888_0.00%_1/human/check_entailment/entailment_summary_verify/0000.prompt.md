You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It generates 1000 test cases, each consisting of three random integers (x, y, z) between 1 and 9. For each test case, it prints the three integers followed by a string indicating the relationship between them: 'peak' if y is greater than both x and z, 'stair' if y is less than both x and z, and 'none' otherwise. After 1000 iterations, the function concludes without modifying any external variables.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not correctly handle cases where `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal (e.g., `0 0 0` or `1 1 1`). According to the problem description, if all three digits are the same, the output should be "NONE". However, the current program will incorrectly output "none" for such cases, which is not in the correct format as specified in the problem description. Additionally, the program generates random inputs instead of reading them from the input, which does not follow the problem's input requirements.
