The only variables in the loop head are `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to 1000, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, which is less than or equal to 1000. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three digits a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The number of test cases, t, is a positive integer where 1 <= t <= 1000. `i` is 1.**
