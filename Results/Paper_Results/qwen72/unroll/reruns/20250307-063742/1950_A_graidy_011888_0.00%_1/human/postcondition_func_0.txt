The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It generates 1000 test cases, each consisting of three random integers (x, y, z) between 1 and 9. For each test case, it prints the three integers followed by a string indicating the relationship between them: 'peak' if y is greater than both x and z, 'stair' if y is less than both x and z, and 'none' otherwise. After 1000 iterations, the function concludes without modifying any external variables.
