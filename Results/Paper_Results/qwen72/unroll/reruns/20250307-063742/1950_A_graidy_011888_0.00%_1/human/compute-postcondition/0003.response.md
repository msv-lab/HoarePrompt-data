The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The number of test cases, `t`, is a positive integer where 1 <= t <= 1000.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), and processes each test case. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.**
