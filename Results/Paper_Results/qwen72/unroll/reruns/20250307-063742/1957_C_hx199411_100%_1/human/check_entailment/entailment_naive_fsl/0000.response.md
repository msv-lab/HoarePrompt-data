Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the initial moves include positions where the row and column are the same (i.e., `r_i == c_i`). According to the problem description, if `r_i == c_i`, the computer skips its turn. However, the program incorrectly increments `num` by 1 for such cases, which affects the calculation of the remaining moves and the final configurations. This can lead to incorrect results for configurations where such moves are present.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 1
1 1
```
The expected output should be 2 because after the initial move at (1, 1), the computer skips its turn, and you can place rooks at (2, 2), (3, 3), or (4, 4), resulting in 2 different configurations (since placing a rook at (2, 2) and (3, 3) or (3, 3) and (2, 2) results in the same configuration). However, the program will output 1, which is incorrect.
