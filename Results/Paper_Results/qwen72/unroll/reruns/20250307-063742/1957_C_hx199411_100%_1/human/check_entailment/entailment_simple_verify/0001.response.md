### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) (the size of the chessboard) and \( k \) (the number of initial moves).
   - It then reads \( k \) moves, each consisting of two integers \( r_i \) and \( c_i \).

2. **Initial Moves Counting**:
   - The program initializes a variable `num` to 0.
   - For each move, if \( r_i = c_i \), it increments `num` by 1 (since the computer skips its turn).
   - If \( r_i \neq c_i \), it increments `num` by 2 (since both you and the computer place a rook).
   - This counting is correct because it accurately reflects the number of positions occupied by rooks after \( k \) moves, considering the mirroring behavior of the computer.

3. **Remaining Moves Calculation**:
   - The program calculates \( m = n - num \), which represents the number of remaining positions on the board where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.
   - This calculation is correct because it subtracts the number of occupied positions from the total number of positions on the board.

4. **Base Cases**:
   - If \( m = 0 \) or \( m = 1 \), the program prints 1, as there is only one configuration possible in these cases.
   - These base cases are correct because:
     - If \( m = 0 \), there are no remaining positions to place rooks, so there is only one configuration (the current one).
     - If \( m = 1 \), there is only one remaining position, and placing a rook in that position results in only one configuration.

5. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - For \( m > 1 \), the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation is:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This recurrence relation is correct because:
     - `dp[i - 1]` accounts for placing a rook in a new row and column, reducing the problem to \( i - 1 \).
     - `(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2` accounts for placing a rook in a new row and column, and then placing another rook in the remaining \( i - 2 \) positions, considering both possible placements (white and black).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and uses a valid dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible final configurations. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
