### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), followed by \( k \) pairs of integers \( (r_i, c_i) \).

2. **Initial Moves Counting**:
   - The program initializes `num` to 0.
   - For each move, if \( r_i = c_i \), it increments `num` by 1 (since the computer skips its turn).
   - If \( r_i \neq c_i \), it increments `num` by 2 (since both you and the computer place a rook).
   - This counting is correct because each move \( (r_i, c_i) \) where \( r_i \neq c_i \) results in two rooks being placed, one by you and one by the computer. If \( r_i = c_i \), only one rook is placed.

3. **Remaining Moves Calculation**:
   - The program calculates \( m = n - num \), which represents the number of remaining positions on the board where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.
   - This calculation is correct because `num` correctly counts the number of positions already occupied by rooks.

4. **Base Cases**:
   - If \( m = 0 \) or \( m = 1 \), the program prints 1.
   - This is correct because:
     - If \( m = 0 \), all positions are occupied, and there is only one configuration.
     - If \( m = 1 \), there is only one position left, and you can place a rook there, resulting in only one configuration.

5. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - The program uses a dynamic programming array `dp` to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For \( i \geq 3 \), the recurrence relation is:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This recurrence relation is correct because:
     - `dp[i - 1]` accounts for placing a rook in a new row and column, reducing the problem to \( i - 1 \).
     - \((i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2\) accounts for placing a rook in a new row and column, and then placing another rook in the remaining \( i - 2 \) positions, considering both possible placements (one by you and one by the computer).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, counts the initial moves, calculates the remaining moves, and uses a valid dynamic programming approach to compute the number of possible final configurations. The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
