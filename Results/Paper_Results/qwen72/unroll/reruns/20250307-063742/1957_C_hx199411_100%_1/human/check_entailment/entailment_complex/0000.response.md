Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)`.

2. **Initial Calculation of `num`**:
   - The variable `num` is used to count the number of positions that are already occupied or will be occupied by the computer's mirrored moves.
   - For each move `(r_i, c_i)`, if `r_i == c_i`, the computer skips its turn, and `num` is incremented by 1.
   - If `r_i != c_i`, the computer places a rook at `(c_i, r_i)`, and `num` is incremented by 2 (one for the player's move and one for the computer's move).

3. **Calculation of `m`**:
   - `m` is calculated as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions on the board that are not yet occupied by rooks.

4. **Dynamic Programming Array `dp`**:
   - The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` to store the number of ways to arrange `m` elements.
   - `dp[1]` is set to 1, which is correct because there is only one way to place one rook on a 1x1 board.
   - `dp[2]` is set to 3, which is correct because there are three ways to place two rooks on a 2x2 board: (1,1) and (2,2), (1,2) and (2,1), and (2,1) and (1,2).

5. **DP Array Calculation**:
   - The function correctly updates the DP array for `i` from 3 to `m` using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the number of ways to place `i` rooks on an `i x i` board, considering the constraints of the problem.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints `dp[m]` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `m` is 0, the function prints 1, which is correct because there is only one configuration (no rooks on the board).
   - If `m` is 1, the function prints 1, which is correct because there is only one way to place one rook on a 1x1 board.

8. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is correctly applied to ensure that the result fits within the specified range.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
