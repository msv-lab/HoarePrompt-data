Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)`. It calculates a value `num` based on the pairs, where `num` is incremented by 1 if `r_i` equals `c_i`, and by 2 otherwise. It then computes `m` as `n - num`. If `m` is 0 or 1, the function prints 1. Otherwise, it computes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` is the number of ways to arrange `i` elements under certain conditions, and prints `dp[m]`. After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, and the function has printed the result for each test case. **
