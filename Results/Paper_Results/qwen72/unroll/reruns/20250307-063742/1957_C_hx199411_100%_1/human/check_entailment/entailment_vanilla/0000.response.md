Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Chessboard and Rooks**: We have an \( n \times n \) chessboard where you and the computer take turns placing white and black rooks, respectively. The rooks cannot attack each other, meaning no two rooks can share the same row or column.
2. **Mirroring Moves**: When you place a white rook at position \((r, c)\), the computer places a black rook at \((c, r)\). If \( r = c \), the computer skips its turn.
3. **Final Configurations**: After \( k \) initial moves, you need to determine the number of different final configurations possible when the game continues until no valid moves remain. The configurations are considered different if there is a difference in the presence or color of rooks at any coordinate.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) (the size of the chessboard) and \( k \) (the number of initial moves).
   - It then reads \( k \) moves, each consisting of two integers \( r_i \) and \( c_i \).

2. **Counting Initial Moves**:
   - The program initializes a variable `num` to 0.
   - For each move, if \( r_i = c_i \), it increments `num` by 1 (since the computer skips its turn).
   - If \( r_i \neq c_i \), it increments `num` by 2 (since both you and the computer place a rook).

3. **Calculating Remaining Moves**:
   - The program calculates \( m = n - num \), which represents the number of remaining positions on the board where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Final Configurations**:
   - If \( m = 0 \) or \( m = 1 \), the program prints 1, as there is only one configuration possible in these cases.
   - For \( m > 1 \), the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations:
     - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on an \( i \times i \) board.
     - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
     - For \( i \geq 3 \), the recurrence relation is:
       \[
       dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
       \]
     - This recurrence relation accounts for:
       - Placing a rook in a new row and column, reducing the problem to \( i - 1 \).
       - Placing a rook in a new row and column, and then placing another rook in the remaining \( i - 2 \) positions, considering both possible placements.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. **Initial Moves Counting**: The program correctly counts the number of initial moves and their impact on the board.
3. **Remaining Moves Calculation**: The calculation of \( m \) is correct.
4. **Base Cases**: The base cases for \( m = 0 \) and \( m = 1 \) are correctly handled.
5. **Dynamic Programming**: The dynamic programming approach is correct and follows the given recurrence relation. The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and uses a valid dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible final configurations.

Correctness: **True**
