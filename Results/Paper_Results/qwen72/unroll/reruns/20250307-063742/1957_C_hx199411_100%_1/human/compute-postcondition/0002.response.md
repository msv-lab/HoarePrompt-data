Output State: **t = 0, n and k retain their last input values, num is the sum of 1 or 2 based on the last set of moves, m is calculated as n - num, and dp[m] is the final value printed for the last test case.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` starts with an initial value and is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `t` will be 0.
- The variables `n` and `k` are updated in each iteration based on the input provided. After the loop, they will retain the values from the last test case.
- The variable `num` is reset to 0 at the start of each test case and is incremented by 1 if the move is on the diagonal (i.e., `c == r`), or by 2 if the move is not on the diagonal (i.e., `c != r`). After the loop, `num` will be the sum of these increments for the last test case.
- The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num` for the last test case.
- The array `dp` is used to compute the final value for `m` in the last test case, and this value is printed. The array `dp` is reset for each test case, and the final value `dp[m]` is the result of the dynamic programming computation for the last test case.
