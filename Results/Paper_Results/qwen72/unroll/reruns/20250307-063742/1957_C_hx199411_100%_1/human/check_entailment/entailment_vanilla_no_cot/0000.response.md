Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.

2. **Tracking Moves**: It tracks the number of rooks that have been placed on the board, differentiating between rooks placed on the main diagonal (where `r == c`) and those placed off the diagonal (where `r != c`). Each move on the diagonal adds 1 to the count, while each move off the diagonal adds 2 (since both the player's move and the computer's mirrored move are considered).

3. **Calculating Remaining Moves**: It calculates the number of remaining positions `m` where no rook has been placed yet by subtracting the total number of rooks placed (`num`) from the size of the board `n`.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Permutations**: The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations. The `dp` array is used to store the number of configurations for a given number of remaining positions. The base cases are:
   - `dp[1] = 1`: Only one configuration if there is one remaining position.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: Three configurations if there are two remaining positions (one for each position being a rook, and one for both being rooks).

5. **DP Transition**: The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions. This formula considers:
   - Placing a rook in one of the remaining positions and leaving the rest as they are (`dp[i - 1]`).
   - Placing two rooks in the remaining positions, ensuring they do not attack each other (`(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2`).

6. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The program handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
