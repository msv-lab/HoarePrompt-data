### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` representing the moves.

2. **Move Calculation**:
   - The function calculates `num` based on the moves:
     - If `r_i` equals `c_i`, `num` is incremented by 1 (since the computer skips its turn).
     - If `r_i` does not equal `c_i`, `num` is incremented by 2 (since both the player and the computer place a rook).

3. **Remaining Moves Calculation**:
   - The function computes `m` as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions on the board where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.

4. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - The function uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks:
     - `dp[1]` is set to 1, representing the base case where there is only one way to place one rook.
     - `dp[2]` is set to 3, representing the base case where there are three ways to place two rooks.
     - For `i` from 3 to `m`, the function updates `dp[i]` using the formula:
       \[
       dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
       \]
     - This formula accounts for the number of ways to place `i` rooks, considering the constraints of the problem.

5. **Output**:
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, the function prints 1, which is correct because there is only one way to place no rooks or one rook.
   - For other values of `m`, the function prints `dp[m]`, which is the number of ways to place the remaining rooks.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard given the constraints and the dynamic programming approach. The execution summary confirms that the function processes the input and outputs the correct results for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
