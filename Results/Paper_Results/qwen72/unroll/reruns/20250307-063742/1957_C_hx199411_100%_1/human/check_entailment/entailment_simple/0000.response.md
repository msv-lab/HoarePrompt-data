### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads `k` moves, each consisting of a pair of integers `(r_i, c_i)`.

2. **Move Counting:**
   - The program initializes `num` to 0, which will be used to count the number of moves that have been played (including both the player's and the computer's moves).
   - For each move `(r_i, c_i)`, it increments `num` by 2 if `r_i != c_i` (since both the player and the computer place a rook), and by 1 if `r_i == c_i` (since only the player places a rook and the computer skips).

3. **Remaining Moves Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `m` as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining moves that can be made on the board.

4. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, the program correctly prints 1, as there is only one possible configuration in these cases.
   - For `m > 1`, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations:
     - `dp[1]` is set to 1, as there is only one way to place one rook.
     - `dp[2]` is set to 3, as there are three ways to place two rooks (one on the diagonal and two off-diagonal).
     - For `i` from 3 to `m`, the program calculates `dp[i]` using the formula:
       \[
       dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
       \]
       This formula accounts for the number of ways to place `i` rooks by considering the last rook placed:
       - `dp[i - 1]` represents the number of ways to place `i - 1` rooks and then place the `i`-th rook in a non-attacking position.
       - `(i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2` represents the number of ways to place the `i`-th rook on the diagonal and the `(i - 1)`-th rook in a non-attacking position, considering both the player's and the computer's moves.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final value of `dp[m]` for each test case, which is the number of possible configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic for counting the number of possible final configurations of rooks on the chessboard, given the constraints and the problem description. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for this problem, and the state transitions are correctly handled.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
