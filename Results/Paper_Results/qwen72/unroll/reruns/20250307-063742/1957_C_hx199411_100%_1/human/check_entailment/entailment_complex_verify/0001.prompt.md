You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)`. It calculates a value `num` based on the pairs, where `num` is incremented by 1 if `r_i` equals `c_i`, and by 2 otherwise. It then computes `m` as `n - num`. If `m` is 0 or 1, the function prints 1. Otherwise, it computes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` is the number of ways to arrange `i` elements under certain conditions, and prints `dp[m]`. After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, and the function has printed the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Chessboard and Rooks**: We have an \( n \times n \) chessboard where you and the computer take turns placing white and black rooks, respectively. The rooks cannot attack each other, meaning no two rooks can share the same row or column.
2. **Mirroring Moves**: When you place a white rook at position \((r, c)\), the computer places a black rook at \((c, r)\). If \( r = c \), the computer skips its turn.
3. **Final Configurations**: After \( k \) initial moves, you need to determine the number of different final configurations possible when the game continues until no valid moves remain. The configurations are considered different if there is a difference in the presence or color of rooks at any coordinate.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) (the size of the chessboard) and \( k \) (the number of initial moves).
   - It then reads \( k \) moves, each consisting of two integers \( r_i \) and \( c_i \).

2. **Counting Initial Moves**:
   - The program initializes a variable `num` to 0.
   - For each move, if \( r_i = c_i \), it increments `num` by 1 (since the computer skips its turn).
   - If \( r_i \neq c_i \), it increments `num` by 2 (since both you and the computer place a rook).

3. **Calculating Remaining Moves**:
   - The program calculates \( m = n - num \), which represents the number of remaining positions on the board where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Final Configurations**:
   - If \( m = 0 \) or \( m = 1 \), the program prints 1, as there is only one configuration possible in these cases.
   - For \( m > 1 \), the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations:
     - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on an \( i \times i \) board.
     - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
     - For \( i \geq 3 \), the recurrence relation is:
       \[
       dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
       \]
     - This recurrence relation accounts for:
       - Placing a rook in a new row and column, reducing the problem to \( i - 1 \).
       - Placing a rook in a new row and column, and then placing another rook in the remaining \( i - 2 \) positions, considering both possible placements.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. **Initial Moves Counting**: The program correctly counts the number of initial moves and their impact on the board.
3. **Remaining Moves Calculation**: The calculation of \( m \) is correct.
4. **Base Cases**: The base cases for \( m = 0 \) and \( m = 1 \) are correctly handled.
5. **Dynamic Programming**: The dynamic programming approach is correct and follows the given recurrence relation. The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and uses a valid dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible final configurations.

Correctness: **True**
