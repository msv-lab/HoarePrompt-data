The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, and a list of moves represented as pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)`. Here, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the size of the board and the number of moves, respectively. Each move `(r_i, c_i)` is a pair of integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and no two moves share the same row or column.

The function returns different values based on the following cases:
- Case_1: If `k` is 0, the function returns "No moves made."
- Case_2: If `k` is 1, the function returns "Single move made at (r_1, c_1)."
- Case_3: If `k` is greater than 1, the function returns a list of all moves made.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and a list of moves `(r_i, c_i)`. It returns "No moves made" if `k` is 0, "Single move made at (r_1, c_1)" if `k` is 1, or a list of all moves made if `k` is greater than 1.**
