Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `nums` is a deque containing n positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9).**

The code converts the list `nums` into a deque, which is a double-ended queue. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The deque `nums` now contains the same elements as the original list, but it allows efficient appending and popping from both ends.
