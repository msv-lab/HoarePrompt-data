You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**:
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case consists of:
     - Number of ships `n` and number of Kraken attacks `k`.
     - Durability of each ship `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Kraken's Attack Pattern**:
   - The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship.
   - Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1.
   - If a ship's durability reaches 0, it sinks and is removed from the list of ships.
   - The Kraken stops attacking if all ships have sunk or if it has performed `k` attacks.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the number of ships sunk after `k` attacks.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Convert `nums` to a deque**: This allows efficient popping from both ends.
   - **Initialize `ans` to 0**: This will count the number of sunk ships.
   - **While loop**:
     - The loop continues as long as `k` is greater than 0 and there are at least 2 ships left.
     - **Pop the first and last ship**:
       - `a` is the durability of the first ship.
       - `b` is the durability of the last ship.
     - **Calculate `x`**:
       - `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, representing the number of attacks that can be performed on both ships before one of them sinks.
     - **Update `a` and `b`**:
       - Reduce `a` and `b` by `x`.
       - Reduce `k` by `2 * x` (since two ships are attacked).
     - **Check if `a` and `b` are still positive**:
       - If `a` is positive, append it back to the left of the deque.
       - If `a` is not positive, increment `ans` (ship has sunk).
       - If `b` is positive, append it back to the right of the deque.
       - If `b` is not positive, increment `ans` (ship has sunk).
   - **Handle the case with one ship left**:
     - If there is exactly one ship left and `k` is greater than or equal to the remaining durability of that ship, increment `ans` by 1 (the ship will sink).

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, print the number of sunk ships.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Deque Usage**:
   - The use of `deque` is appropriate for efficiently popping from both ends of the list.

2. **Attack Pattern**:
   - The program correctly alternates between attacking the first and last ship by popping from both ends of the deque.
   - The program correctly reduces the durability of the ships and updates `k` accordingly.

3. **Sinking Ships**:
   - The program correctly increments the `ans` counter when a ship's durability reaches 0.
   - The program correctly handles the case where only one ship is left and the Kraken still has attacks remaining.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k` is less than the total number of attacks needed to sink all ships.
   - The program handles the case where `k` is exactly the number of attacks needed to sink all ships.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints given (sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5` and `k` can be up to `10^15`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of ships sunk after `k` attacks by the Kraken. It handles all edge cases and follows the attack pattern as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
