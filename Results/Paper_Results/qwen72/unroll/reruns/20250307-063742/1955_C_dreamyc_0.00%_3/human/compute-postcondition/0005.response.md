Output State: **The program returns the value of `ans` incremented by 1.** 

In natural language: The program returns the value of `ans` after adding 1 to it. This is because `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`, and the code snippet specifies that `ans` should be incremented by 1 before being returned.
