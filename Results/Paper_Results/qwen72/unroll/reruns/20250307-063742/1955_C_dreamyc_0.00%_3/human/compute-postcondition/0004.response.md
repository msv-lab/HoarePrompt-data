Postcondition: **`k` is reduced by the maximum possible even multiples of the minimum value between the first and last elements of `nums` until `k` is less than twice the minimum value, or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. `ans` is incremented by the number of times the minimum value between the first and last elements of `nums` is completely subtracted from both elements. `nums` is modified by removing the first and last elements and appending any remaining positive values back to the deque. `k` is not zero, `nums` has exactly one element, and `k` is greater than or equal to that single element in `nums`.**
