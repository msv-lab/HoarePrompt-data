Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**:
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case consists of:
     - Number of ships `n` and number of Kraken attacks `k`.
     - Durability of each ship `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Kraken's Attack Pattern**:
   - The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship.
   - Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1.
   - If a ship's durability reaches 0, it sinks and is removed from the list of ships.
   - The Kraken stops attacking if all ships have sunk or if it has performed `k` attacks.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the number of ships sunk after `k` attacks.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Convert `nums` to a deque**: This allows efficient popping from both ends.
   - **Initialize `ans` to 0**: This will count the number of sunk ships.
   - **While loop**:
     - The loop continues as long as `k` is greater than 0 and there are at least 2 ships left.
     - **Pop the first and last ship**:
       - `a` is the durability of the first ship.
       - `b` is the durability of the last ship.
     - **Calculate `x`**:
       - `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, representing the number of attacks that can be performed on both ships before one of them sinks.
     - **Update `a` and `b`**:
       - Reduce `a` and `b` by `x`.
       - Reduce `k` by `2 * x` (since two ships are attacked).
     - **Check if `a` and `b` are still positive**:
       - If `a` is positive, append it back to the left of the deque.
       - If `a` is not positive, increment `ans` (ship has sunk).
       - If `b` is positive, append it back to the right of the deque.
       - If `b` is not positive, increment `ans` (ship has sunk).
   - **Handle the case with one ship left**:
     - If there is exactly one ship left and `k` is greater than or equal to the remaining durability of that ship, increment `ans` by 1 (the ship will sink).

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, print the number of sunk ships.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Deque Usage**:
   - The use of `deque` is appropriate for efficiently popping from both ends of the list.

2. **Attack Pattern**:
   - The program correctly alternates between attacking the first and last ship by popping from both ends of the deque.
   - The program correctly reduces the durability of the ships and updates `k` accordingly.

3. **Sinking Ships**:
   - The program correctly increments the `ans` counter when a ship's durability reaches 0.
   - The program correctly handles the case where only one ship is left and the Kraken still has attacks remaining.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k` is less than the total number of attacks needed to sink all ships.
   - The program handles the case where `k` is exactly the number of attacks needed to sink all ships.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints given (sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5` and `k` can be up to `10^15`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of ships sunk after `k` attacks by the Kraken. It handles all edge cases and follows the attack pattern as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
