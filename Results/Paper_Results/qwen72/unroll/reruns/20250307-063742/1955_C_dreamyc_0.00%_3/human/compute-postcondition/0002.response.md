To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to consider the conditions in the loop head: `k` and `len(nums) >= 2`.

1. **Condition `k`:** The variable `k` must be a positive integer for the loop to start. Since the state right before the loop indicates that `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), this condition is already satisfied and does not need to be adjusted.

2. **Condition `len(nums) >= 2`:** The length of the deque `nums` must be at least 2 for the loop to start. The state right before the loop indicates that `nums` is a deque containing `n` positive integers, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2.

Given these considerations, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 2. No other adjustments are necessary.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `nums` is a deque containing n positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9), `ans` is 0**
