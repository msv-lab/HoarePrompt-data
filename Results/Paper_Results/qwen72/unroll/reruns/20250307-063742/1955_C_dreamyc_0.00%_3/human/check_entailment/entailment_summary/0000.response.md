Reasoning:

The provided program aims to simulate the Kraken's attacks on a fleet of ships, where the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship until either the ships are all sunk or the Kraken has made `k` attacks. The program uses a deque to efficiently manage the removal and reinsertion of ships' durability values as they are attacked.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, as well as the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, the list `nums` is converted to a deque to allow efficient popping from both ends.
   - The program enters a loop that continues as long as there are at least two ships left and `k` attacks remain.
   - In each iteration, the first (`a`) and last (`b`) ships' durabilities are removed from the deque.
   - The minimum of `a` and `b` is calculated (`x`), and both `a` and `b` are reduced by `x`. The value of `k` is also reduced by `2 * x` because two ships were attacked.
   - If `a` is still positive after the attack, it is reinserted at the beginning of the deque; otherwise, the ship is considered sunk, and `ans` is incremented.
   - Similarly, if `b` is still positive after the attack, it is reinserted at the end of the deque; otherwise, the ship is considered sunk, and `ans` is incremented.
   - The loop breaks if `k` is less than `2 * x`, meaning there are not enough attacks left to completely sink both ships in the current iteration.
   - After the loop, if there is exactly one ship left and `k` is greater than or equal to its durability, the ship is sunk, and `ans` is incremented by 1.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k` is not enough to sink any ships.
   - It also handles the case where all ships are sunk before `k` attacks are completed.
   - The program efficiently manages the deque, ensuring that the first and last elements are always the ships being attacked.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of ships sunk for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The use of a deque ensures that the operations are efficient, and the logic for handling the attacks and counting the sunk ships is sound.

Correctness: **True**
