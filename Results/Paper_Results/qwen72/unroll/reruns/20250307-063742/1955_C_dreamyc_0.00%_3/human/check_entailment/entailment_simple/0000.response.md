### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ship durabilities `nums`.
   - This part of the program correctly handles the input as described in the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`.
   - It converts `nums` into a deque to efficiently pop elements from both ends.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will keep track of the number of ships sunk.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `k` is greater than 0 and `nums` has at least 2 elements.
   - In each iteration, it pops the first and last elements of the deque (`a` and `b`).
   - It calculates the minimum of `a` and `b` (`x`).
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, it reduces both `a` and `b` by `x` and decrements `k` by `2 * x`.
   - If `a` is still positive after the attack, it is appended back to the left of the deque.
   - If `b` is still positive after the attack, it is appended back to the right of the deque.
   - If either `a` or `b` is reduced to 0 or less, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each ship that sinks.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the main loop, if `k` is still greater than 0 and there is exactly one ship left in the deque, it checks if `k` is greater than or equal to the remaining ship's durability.
   - If so, it increments `ans` by 1 and returns the result.
   - If not, it simply returns `ans`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `nums` has fewer than 2 elements after the main loop.
   - It also correctly handles the case where `k` is 0 or `k` is less than the remaining ship's durability.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It efficiently reduces the durabilities of the ships and counts the number of ships that sink. The use of a deque ensures that the operations are performed in O(1) time, which is crucial for handling large inputs.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description and input constraints.
