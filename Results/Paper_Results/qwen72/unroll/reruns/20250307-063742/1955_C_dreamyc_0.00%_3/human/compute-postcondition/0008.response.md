The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15). `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9).

The function returns the value of `ans` based on the following cases:
- Case_1: If the function reaches a point where it needs to increment `ans` by 1, it returns this incremented value.
- Case_2: If `k` is less than twice the minimum value between the first and last elements of `nums`, or if `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, the function returns the integer value of `ans`, which represents the number of times the minimum value between the first and last elements of `nums` was completely subtracted from both elements.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. It returns the value of `ans` incremented by 1 if a specific condition is met. Otherwise, it returns the integer value of `ans`, which represents the number of times the minimum value between the first and last elements of `nums` was completely subtracted from both elements until `k` is less than twice the minimum value, or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements.**
