You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the Kraken attacks the first and last ship in a way that the remaining durability of the ships is not sufficient to be attacked again in the next cycle. Specifically, if the Kraken attacks the first and last ship, and the remaining durability of one of the ships is less than the number of attacks left, the program incorrectly assumes that both ships will be attacked equally in the next cycle.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 7
1 2 4 3
```

Expected output:
```
3
```

Actual output:
```
2
```

In this case, the Kraken attacks the first ship (1) and the last ship (3) in the first cycle, reducing their durability to 0 and 2 respectively. The first ship sinks, and the list becomes `[2, 4, 2]`. In the next cycle, the Kraken attacks the first ship (2) and the last ship (2), reducing their durability to 1 and 1 respectively. The list becomes `[1, 4, 1]`. In the third cycle, the Kraken attacks the first ship (1) and the last ship (1), reducing their durability to 0 and 0 respectively. Both ships sink, and the list becomes `[4]`. In the fourth cycle, the Kraken attacks the remaining ship (4), reducing its durability to 3. The list remains `[3]`. In the fifth cycle, the Kraken attacks the remaining ship (3), reducing its durability to 2. The list remains `[2]`. In the sixth cycle, the Kraken attacks the remaining ship (2), reducing its durability to 1. The list remains `[1]`. In the seventh cycle, the Kraken attacks the remaining ship (1), reducing its durability to 0, and the ship sinks.

The program incorrectly handles the scenario where the remaining durability of the ships is not sufficient to be attacked equally in the next cycle, leading to an incorrect count of sunk ships.
