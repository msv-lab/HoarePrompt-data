The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer indicating the length of the list), `k` (a positive integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns an integer value `ans`, which represents the number of times the minimum value between the first and last elements of `nums` was completely subtracted from both elements until `k` is less than twice the minimum value, or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. If, after this process, `k` is still greater than or equal to the remaining single element in `nums`, `ans` is incremented by 1 before being returned. The function modifies the `nums` list by removing elements and appending any remaining positive values back to the deque.
