#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9).

    #State: `k` is reduced by the maximum possible even multiples of the minimum value between the first and last elements of `nums` until `k` is less than twice the minimum value, or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. `ans` is incremented by the number of times the minimum value between the first and last elements of `nums` is completely subtracted from both elements. `nums` is modified by removing the first and last elements and appending any remaining positive values back to the deque. Additionally, either `k` is 0, or `len(nums) != 1`, or `k < nums[0]` if `len(nums) == 1`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the integer value of `ans`, which represents the number of times the minimum value between the first and last elements of `nums` was completely subtracted from both elements until `k` is less than twice the minimum value, or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer indicating the length of the list), `k` (a positive integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns an integer value `ans`, which represents the number of times the minimum value between the first and last elements of `nums` was completely subtracted from both elements until `k` is less than twice the minimum value, or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. If, after this process, `k` is still greater than or equal to the remaining single element in `nums`, `ans` is incremented by 1 before being returned. The function modifies the `nums` list by removing elements and appending any remaining positive values back to the deque.
