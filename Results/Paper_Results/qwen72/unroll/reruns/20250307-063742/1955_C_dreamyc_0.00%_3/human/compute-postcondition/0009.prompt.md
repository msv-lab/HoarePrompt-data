You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9).
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `k` is reduced by the maximum possible even multiples of the minimum value between the first and last elements of `nums` until `k` is less than twice the minimum value, or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. `ans` is incremented by the number of times the minimum value between the first and last elements of `nums` is completely subtracted from both elements. `nums` is modified by removing the first and last elements and appending any remaining positive values back to the deque.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns the value of `ans` incremented by 1.
    #State: `k` is reduced by the maximum possible even multiples of the minimum value between the first and last elements of `nums` until `k` is less than twice the minimum value, or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. `ans` is incremented by the number of times the minimum value between the first and last elements of `nums` is completely subtracted from both elements. `nums` is modified by removing the first and last elements and appending any remaining positive values back to the deque. Additionally, either `k` is 0, or `len(nums) != 1`, or `k < nums[0]` if `len(nums) == 1`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the integer value of `ans`, which represents the number of times the minimum value between the first and last elements of `nums` was completely subtracted from both elements until `k` is less than twice the minimum value, or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. It returns the value of `ans` incremented by 1 if a specific condition is met. Otherwise, it returns the integer value of `ans`, which represents the number of times the minimum value between the first and last elements of `nums` was completely subtracted from both elements until `k` is less than twice the minimum value, or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the value of `ans` incremented by 1.

Case_2: The program returns the integer value of `ans`, which represents the number of times the minimum value between the first and last elements of `nums` was completely subtracted from both elements until `k` is less than twice the minimum value, or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
