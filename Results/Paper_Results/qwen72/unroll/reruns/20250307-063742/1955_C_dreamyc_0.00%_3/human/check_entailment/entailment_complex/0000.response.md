Reasoning:

The program aims to simulate the Kraken's attacks on a series of ships, where the attacks alternate between the first and last ship in a list until the Kraken has no more attacks left or all ships have sunk. The program uses a `deque` to efficiently manage the ships' durability and to handle the alternating attacks.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Converts `nums` to a `deque` for efficient popping from both ends.
   - Initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of ships sunk.
   - The main loop runs as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and at least two ships remain (`len(nums) >= 2`).

3. **Attack Simulation:**
   - The first and last ship's durabilities are popped from the deque.
   - The minimum of these two durabilities is calculated (`x`).
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, both ships' durabilities are reduced by `x`, and `k` is reduced by `2 * x`.
   - Any remaining positive durability is appended back to the deque.
   - If a ship's durability is reduced to 0 or less, `ans` is incremented by 1.

4. **Final Check:**
   - If there is only one ship left and `k` is greater than or equal to its remaining durability, the ship is sunk, and `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - The function returns `ans`, which is the total number of ships sunk.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where `k` is less than `2 * x` by breaking out of the loop, ensuring that the remaining attacks are not wasted.
  - It also correctly handles the case where only one ship remains and `k` is sufficient to sink it.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of `deque` is efficient for popping from both ends, which is crucial for the alternating attack pattern.
  - The program reduces `k` by the maximum possible even multiples of the minimum durability, which optimizes the number of iterations.

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic for reducing the durabilities and counting the sunk ships is correct.
  - The final check for the single remaining ship is also correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks and count the number of ships sunk. It handles all edge cases and efficiently manages the ship durabilities using a `deque`.

Correctness: **True**
