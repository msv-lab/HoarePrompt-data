Postcondition: **`k` is reduced by the maximum possible even multiples of the minimum value between the first and last elements of `nums` until `k` is less than twice the minimum value, or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. `ans` is incremented by the number of times the minimum value between the first and last elements of `nums` is completely subtracted from both elements. `nums` is modified by removing the first and last elements and appending any remaining positive values back to the deque. Additionally, either `k` is 0, or `len(nums) != 1`, or `k < nums[0]` if `len(nums) == 1`.**
