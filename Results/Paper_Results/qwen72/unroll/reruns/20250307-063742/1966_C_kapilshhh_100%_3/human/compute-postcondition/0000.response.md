Output State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `nums` where each sublist represents the piles in a test case and contains `n` integers (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) with each integer `a_i` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in the i-th pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `tc` is an input integer.**
