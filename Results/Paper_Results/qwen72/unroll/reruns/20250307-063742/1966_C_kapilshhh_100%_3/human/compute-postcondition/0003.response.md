The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `nums`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `nums` is a list of lists, where each sublist represents the piles in a test case and contains `n` integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5). Each integer `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) in a sublist represents the initial number of stones in the i-th pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case in `nums`. The result for each test case is the number of stones that can be removed from the piles to achieve a specific condition (though the specific condition is not provided in the constraints).

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `nums` where each sublist contains integers representing the initial number of stones in the piles. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to the number of stones that can be removed from the piles in a test case to achieve a specific condition.**
