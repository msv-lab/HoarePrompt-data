Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the `tc` variable is now 0. The `dp` variable will be `True` or `False` depending on the last test case's conditions. The `n` variable will be the length of the last `arr` list minus 1. The `arr` list will be the sorted unique elements of the last input list, with an additional 0 appended at the end.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `tc` times, and after each iteration, `tc` is decremented by 1. Once the loop finishes, `tc` will be 0.
- The `dp` variable is updated based on the conditions inside the loop. After the loop finishes, `dp` will hold the final result of the last test case, which is either `True` or `False`.
- The `n` variable is set to the length of the `arr` list minus 1 at the start of each iteration. After the loop finishes, `n` will hold the value of the length of the last `arr` list minus 1.
- The `arr` list is constructed by taking the input list of integers, removing duplicates, sorting it in descending order, and appending a 0 at the end. After the loop finishes, `arr` will hold the last constructed list.
