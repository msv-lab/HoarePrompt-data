Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists nums where each sublist represents the piles in a test case and contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) with each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in the i-th pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of lists, each sublist representing the piles in a test case.
