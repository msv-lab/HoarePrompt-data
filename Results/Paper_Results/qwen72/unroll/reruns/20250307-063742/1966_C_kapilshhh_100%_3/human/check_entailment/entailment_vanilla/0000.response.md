### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with piles of stones.
   - On each turn, a player must select a positive integer \( k \) that is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile and remove \( k \) stones from each nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.
   - Alice goes first, and both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game is a variant of the Nim game, but with a twist: the number of stones removed from each pile is the same.
   - The optimal strategy depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of distinct pile sizes.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**:
     - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
     - For each test case, it reads the number of piles \( n \) and the initial number of stones in each pile.
   - **Pile Size Processing**:
     - The program converts the list of pile sizes to a set to remove duplicates, then sorts the unique pile sizes in descending order.
     - It appends a zero to the end of the sorted list to handle edge cases.
   - **Dynamic Programming (DP) Variable**:
     - The variable `dp` is used to track the winning state. It starts as `True` (Alice's turn).
   - **Main Loop**:
     - The program iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes.
     - For each pile size \( \text{arr}[i] \), it checks if the difference between the current pile size and the next pile size is greater than 1.
     - If the difference is greater than 1, it toggles the `dp` variable.
     - The `dp` variable is also toggled if it is currently `False`.
   - **Output**:
     - After processing all unique pile sizes, the program prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True`, otherwise "Bob".

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the unique pile sizes and sorts them in descending order.
   - The logic for toggling the `dp` variable based on the difference between consecutive pile sizes is correct.
   - The program correctly handles the edge case of a single pile by appending a zero to the list.
   - The final output is based on the state of the `dp` variable, which correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
