The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tc` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `tc` must be greater than 0.

State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `nums` where each sublist represents the piles in a test case and contains `n` integers (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) with each integer `a_i` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in the i-th pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `tc` must be greater than 0**
