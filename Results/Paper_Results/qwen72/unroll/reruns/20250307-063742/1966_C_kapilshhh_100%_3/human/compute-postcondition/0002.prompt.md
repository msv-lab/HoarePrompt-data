Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `nums` where each sublist represents the piles in a test case and contains `n` integers (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) with each integer `a_i` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in the i-th pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `tc` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while tc > 0:
    n = int(input())
    arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True
        ) + [0]
    dp = True
    n = len(arr) - 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp = arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp
    print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
    tc -= 1



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
