Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. One specific case where the program fails is when all piles have the same number of stones. According to the problem description, if all piles have the same number of stones, Alice can win by choosing \( k \) equal to the number of stones in each pile, which will empty all piles in one move. However, the program does not correctly determine this.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
The expected output is "Alice" because Alice can choose \( k = 3 \) and empty all piles in one move. However, the program will output "Bob" because it incorrectly determines the winner based on the logic in the loop.

The issue lies in the logic of the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    dp = arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp
```
This loop is not correctly capturing the game's rules, especially when all piles have the same number of stones. The program should correctly identify that if all piles have the same number of stones, Alice wins immediately.
