The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `size`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `size`. If `size` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `sequence` and `result` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`sequence` contains integers from 0 to (size - 1), `result` is the output of `func_1(number - 2), `i` is 0, `size` must be greater than 0**
