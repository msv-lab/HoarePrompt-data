### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array that are strictly increasing and maintain their relative order.
   - The array elements should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will have a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - The function uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
   - The key idea is to use a binary representation of the number \( X - 1 \) to determine the structure of the sequence.

3. **Function `func_1` Breakdown:**
   - **Base Case:**
     - If `number` is 0, the function returns 0, indicating that no more elements need to be added to the sequence.
   - **Recursive Case:**
     - The function finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number`.
     - It then appends the first `size` integers (0, 1, 2, ..., size-1) to the sequence.
     - It recursively calls itself with the remaining part of the number (`number - (1 << size) + 1`).
     - After the recursive call, it modifies the last `result` elements of the sequence by adding `result` to them.

4. **Output Verification:**
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the value of \( X \).
   - It initializes an empty list `result` and calls `func_1` with \( X - 1 \) and the `result` list.
   - It prints the length of the `result` list and the list itself.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly generates a sequence that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence is constructed by adding elements in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \).
   - The recursive calls and the modifications to the sequence ensure that the sequence is built correctly.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the base case where `number` is 0.
   - The function ensures that the sequence is built within the constraints of the problem (length at most 200 and elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\)).

7. **Example Verification:**
   - For \( X = 2 \), the sequence generated is `[0]`, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.
   - For \( X = 5 \), the sequence generated is `[0, 1, 0]`, which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0]`.
   - For \( X = 13 \), the sequence generated is `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]`, which has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
   - For \( X = 37 \), the sequence generated is `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]`, which has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly generates an array of integers that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given \( X \). The algorithm is sound and handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
