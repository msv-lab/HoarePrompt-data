Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `X = 1` correctly. According to the problem description, the number of test cases `t` can range from 1 to 1000, and each test case can have an integer `X` ranging from 2 to \(10^{18}\). However, the program does not account for the possibility of `X = 1`, which is a valid input according to the problem constraints. For `X = 1`, the only array that has exactly one increasing subsequence is an array with a single element, but the program will not generate such an array because it starts by subtracting 1 from `n` (i.e., `n - 1`), and then proceeds to generate a sequence based on the remaining value. This will lead to incorrect results for `X = 1`.

For example, if the input is:
```
1
1
```
The program will output:
```
0
```
Which is incorrect because the output should be:
```
1
0
```
This is a clear case where the program does not meet the problem requirements.
