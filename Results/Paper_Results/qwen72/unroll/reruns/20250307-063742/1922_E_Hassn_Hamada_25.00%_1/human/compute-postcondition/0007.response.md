The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `size`. For the loop to execute, `size` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0, which is the default behavior of the `range` function in Python. The condition that `size` is the smallest integer such that `(1 << size) - 1 > number` does not need to be adjusted as it is a given state and is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `size` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0 (which is already the default).

State: **`size` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
