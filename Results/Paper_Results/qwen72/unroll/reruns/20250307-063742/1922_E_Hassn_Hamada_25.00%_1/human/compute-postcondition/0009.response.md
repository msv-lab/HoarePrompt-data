Initial State: sequence contains integers from 0 to (size - 1).

```
result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

1. The expression `1 << size` shifts the binary representation of 1 to the left by `size` positions, which is equivalent to `2 ** size`.
2. The expression `number - (1 << size) + 1` calculates a new value by subtracting `2 ** size` from `number` and then adding 1.
3. The function `func_1` is called with the calculated value and the `sequence` as arguments.
4. The result of the function call is assigned to the variable `result`.

Since the initial state specifies that `sequence` contains integers from 0 to (size - 1), and the value of `number` is not specified, we can only describe the impact on `result` and the function call.

Output State: **`sequence` contains integers from 0 to (size - 1), `result` is the output of `func_1(number - (2 ** size) + 1, sequence)`.**
