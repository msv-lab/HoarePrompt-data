Output State: **number is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, sequence is a list of integers with a length at most 200, and all elements of sequence are in the range [-10^9; 10^9]. The function returns the size of the generated sequence. Additionally, number is not equal to 0. `size` is 1.**

The code snippet assigns the value 1 to the variable `size`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition that `size` is now 1.
