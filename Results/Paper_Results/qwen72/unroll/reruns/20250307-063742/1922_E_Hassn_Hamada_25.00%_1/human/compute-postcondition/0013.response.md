The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number` and `sequence`. `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence` is a list of integers with a length at most 200, where all elements are in the range [-10^9; 10^9].

**Case_1:** The function returns 0.

**Case_2:** The function attempts to return the sum of the length of the list `sequence` (which is 5) and the variable `result` (which remains `R`). Since `R` is not a numeric value, the function will raise a `TypeError`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It returns 0 in one case. In another case, it attempts to return the sum of the length of `sequence` (which is 5) and a non-numeric variable `R`, resulting in a `TypeError`.**
