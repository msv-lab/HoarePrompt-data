#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It returns the size of a generated sequence, which is the smallest integer `size` such that \( (1 << size) - 1 > number \). The function appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence` list and recursively calls itself with `number - (1 << size) + 1` and the modified `sequence`. The final return value is the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call. If `number` is 0, the function returns 0.
