To determine if the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to evaluate the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`. Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `sequence` is a list of integers with a length at most 200, and all elements of `sequence` are in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
   - The function returns the size of the generated sequence.
   - `number` is not equal to 0.
   - `size` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\).

3. **Evaluate the Condition**:
   - Calculate \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1\) with `size` = 1:
     \[
     (1 << (1 + 1)) - 1 = (1 << 2) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3
     \]
   - The condition becomes \(3 \leq \text{number}\).

4. **Check the Initial State**:
   - `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
   - Since \(2 \leq \text{number}\), it is possible for `number` to be 3 or greater.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The condition \(3 \leq \text{number}\) is satisfied by the initial state of `number` (since `number` is at least 2 and can be as large as \(10^{18}\)).
   - Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers with a length at most 200, and all elements of `sequence` are in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\). The function returns the size of the generated sequence. Additionally, `number` is not equal to 0. `size` is 1.**
