To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's break down the loop step by step.

### Initial State:
- `sequence` contains integers from 0 to (size - 1).
- `result` is the output of `func_1(number - 2)`, but since `func_1` is not defined, we will assume `result` is a constant value. Let's denote this value as `R`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(size):
    assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
    sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop runs `size` times, with `i` ranging from 0 to (size - 1).

2. **Assertion**:
   - The assertion ensures that the index `-result - i - 1` is within the valid range of negative indices for the `sequence` list.
   - This means `-len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1`, which simplifies to `0 <= result + i + 1 <= len(sequence)`.

3. **Index Calculation**:
   - The index `-result - i - 1` is used to access elements in the `sequence` list from the end.
   - For example, if `result` is 2 and `size` is 5, the indices will be:
     - `i = 0`: `-2 - 0 - 1 = -3` (which corresponds to `sequence[2]`)
     - `i = 1`: `-2 - 1 - 1 = -4` (which corresponds to `sequence[1]`)
     - `i = 2`: `-2 - 2 - 1 = -5` (which corresponds to `sequence[0]`)
     - `i = 3`: `-2 - 3 - 1 = -6` (which is out of bounds, so the loop will not run this iteration)
     - `i = 4`: `-2 - 4 - 1 = -7` (which is out of bounds, so the loop will not run this iteration)

4. **Modification**:
   - The element at the index `-result - i - 1` is incremented by `result`.

### Example:
Let's assume `size = 5` and `result = 2`:
- Initial `sequence`: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

#### Iteration 0:
- `i = 0`
- Index: `-2 - 0 - 1 = -3` (which corresponds to `sequence[2]`)
- `sequence[2] += 2` → `sequence[2] = 4`
- `sequence`: `[0, 1, 4, 3, 4]`

#### Iteration 1:
- `i = 1`
- Index: `-2 - 1 - 1 = -4` (which corresponds to `sequence[1]`)
- `sequence[1] += 2` → `sequence[1] = 3`
- `sequence`: `[0, 3, 4, 3, 4]`

#### Iteration 2:
- `i = 2`
- Index: `-2 - 2 - 1 = -5` (which corresponds to `sequence[0]`)
- `sequence[0] += 2` → `sequence[0] = 2`
- `sequence`: `[2, 3, 4, 3, 4]`

#### Iteration 3:
- `i = 3`
- Index: `-2 - 3 - 1 = -6` (which is out of bounds, so the loop will not run this iteration)

#### Iteration 4:
- `i = 4`
- Index: `-2 - 4 - 1 = -7` (which is out of bounds, so the loop will not run this iteration)

### Final Output State:
- `sequence`: `[2, 3, 4, 3, 4]`
- `result`: `R` (unchanged)

### Natural Language Description:
- The `sequence` list is modified such that the elements at the indices calculated by `-result - i - 1` are incremented by `result`.
- The `result` variable remains unchanged.

Output State: **`sequence` contains the values `[2, 3, 4, 3, 4]` and `result` remains `R`.**
