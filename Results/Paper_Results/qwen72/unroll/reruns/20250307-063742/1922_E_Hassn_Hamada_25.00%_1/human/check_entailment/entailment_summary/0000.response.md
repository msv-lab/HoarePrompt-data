Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to generate an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The function `func_1` is designed to recursively construct such an array by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.

1. **Base Case**: If `number` is 0, the function returns 0, indicating that no elements need to be added to the sequence. This is correct because an empty subsequence is considered an increasing subsequence.

2. **Recursive Case**: The function calculates the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number + 1`. This is done by finding the smallest `size` such that \( (1 << size + 1) - 1 > number \). This step is crucial because the number of increasing subsequences in a sequence of length `size` with unique elements is \( 2^size - 1 \).

3. **Sequence Construction**: The function appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence`. This creates a sequence with \( 2^size - 1 \) increasing subsequences.

4. **Recursive Call**: The function then recursively calls itself with the remaining number of increasing subsequences needed, which is \( number - (1 << size) + 1 \). This step ensures that the total number of increasing subsequences is exactly `number`.

5. **Adjusting Elements**: After the recursive call, the function adjusts the elements of the sequence to ensure that the subsequences are unique and correctly counted. This is done by adding the result of the recursive call to the elements at specific positions in the sequence.

6. **Output**: The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.

The logic of the program is sound and aligns with the problem description. The recursive approach and the sequence construction ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \). The adjustments made to the sequence elements also ensure that the subsequences are unique and correctly counted.

However, there is a potential issue with the range of the elements in the sequence. The problem description states that all elements of the array should be in the range \([-10^9; 10^9]\). The current implementation appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` and then modifies them. While this generally works, it is important to ensure that the modifications do not push the elements out of the allowed range. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the elements should remain within the valid range.

After reviewing the logic and the constraints, the program appears to be correct and should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
