### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Loop Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and initializes an empty list `result`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers such that the number of increasing subsequences in the sequence is exactly `number + 1`.
   - The function first checks if `number` is 0. If it is, it returns 0, indicating that no elements need to be added to the sequence.
   - It then calculates the smallest `size` such that `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is greater than `number`. This is done using a while loop.
   - The function appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence`.
   - It recursively calls `func_1` with the updated `number` and `sequence`.
   - After the recursive call, it modifies the sequence by adding the result of the recursive call to the elements at specific positions.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the `result` list and the elements of the list for each test case.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return an integer, but the variable `result` is used in the return statement, which is also the name of the list being modified. This can lead to confusion.
   - The comment suggests that `result` is a numeric value, but in the context of the function, `result` is the size returned by the recursive call, which is an integer. Therefore, the return statement `return size + result` should be correct.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm is based on the idea of constructing a sequence that has a specific number of increasing subsequences. The use of powers of 2 and the recursive approach is a valid method to achieve this.
   - The sequence construction and modification steps are logically consistent with the problem requirements.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `number` is 0 correctly by returning 0.
   - The program should handle large values of `number` (up to \(10^{18}\)) efficiently due to the logarithmic nature of the while loop and the recursive calls.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be logically correct and should work as intended for the given problem description. The comments suggest a potential issue with the variable `result`, but the actual code does not have this issue. The function `func_1` correctly returns an integer, and the sequence is constructed and modified appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
