You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It returns the size of a generated sequence, which is the smallest integer `size` such that \( (1 << size) - 1 > number \). The function appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence` list and recursively calls itself with `number - (1 << size) + 1` and the modified `sequence`. The final return value is the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call. If `number` is 0, the function returns 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array that are strictly increasing and maintain their relative order.
   - The array elements should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will have a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - The function uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
   - The key idea is to use a binary representation of the number \( X - 1 \) to determine the structure of the sequence.

3. **Function `func_1` Breakdown:**
   - **Base Case:**
     - If `number` is 0, the function returns 0, indicating that no more elements need to be added to the sequence.
   - **Recursive Case:**
     - The function finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number`.
     - It then appends the first `size` integers (0, 1, 2, ..., size-1) to the sequence.
     - It recursively calls itself with the remaining part of the number (`number - (1 << size) + 1`).
     - After the recursive call, it modifies the last `result` elements of the sequence by adding `result` to them.

4. **Output Verification:**
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the value of \( X \).
   - It initializes an empty list `result` and calls `func_1` with \( X - 1 \) and the `result` list.
   - It prints the length of the `result` list and the list itself.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly generates a sequence that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence is constructed by adding elements in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \).
   - The recursive calls and the modifications to the sequence ensure that the sequence is built correctly.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the base case where `number` is 0.
   - The function ensures that the sequence is built within the constraints of the problem (length at most 200 and elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\)).

7. **Example Verification:**
   - For \( X = 2 \), the sequence generated is `[0]`, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.
   - For \( X = 5 \), the sequence generated is `[0, 1, 0]`, which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0]`.
   - For \( X = 13 \), the sequence generated is `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]`, which has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
   - For \( X = 37 \), the sequence generated is `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]`, which has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly generates an array of integers that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given \( X \). The algorithm is sound and handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
