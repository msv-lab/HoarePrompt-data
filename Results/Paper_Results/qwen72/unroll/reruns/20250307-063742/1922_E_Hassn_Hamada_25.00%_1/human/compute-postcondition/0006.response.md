Output State: **size is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 > number.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, `size` will be the smallest integer for which the value of \(2^{\text{size}} - 1\) is greater than the initial value of `number`. The loop increments `size` until this condition is met.
