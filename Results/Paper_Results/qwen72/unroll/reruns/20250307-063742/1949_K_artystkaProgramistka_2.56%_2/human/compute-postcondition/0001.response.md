Output State: **`n`, `n_a`, `n_b`, and `n_c` are positive integers such that `n_a` + `n_b` + `n_c` = `n` and 1 <= `n_a`, `n_b`, `n_c` <= `n-2`. `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `numbers[i]` <= 10^9, and `numbers` is now sorted in descending order. `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists.**
