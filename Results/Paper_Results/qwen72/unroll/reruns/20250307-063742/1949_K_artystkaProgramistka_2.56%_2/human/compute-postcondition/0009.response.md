Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n` and `1 <= na, nb, nc <= n-2`. `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9. The function returns 'YES' along with three lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` if it can successfully divide the `numbers` list into these groups according to the specified pattern: `group_a` contains the first, fourth, seventh, etc., numbers (up to `na` numbers), `group_b` contains the second, fifth, eighth, etc., numbers (up to `nb` numbers), and `group_c` contains the third, sixth, ninth, etc., numbers (up to `nc` numbers). If the division is not possible, the function returns 'NO'.**
