The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `numbers`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If `numbers` is not empty, the loop will execute. Given the state before the loop starts, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers, and `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, `numbers` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

At the start of the loop, `num` will be the first element in the `numbers` list, and `numbers` must be a non-empty list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.

State: **`n`, `n_a`, `n_b`, and `n_c` are positive integers such that `n_a` + `n_b` + `n_c` = `n` and 1 <= `n_a`, `n_b`, `n_c` <= `n-2`. `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `numbers[i]` <= 10^9, and `numbers` is now sorted in descending order. `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists. `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are all 0. `num` is the first element in `numbers`, and `numbers` must have at least one element.**
