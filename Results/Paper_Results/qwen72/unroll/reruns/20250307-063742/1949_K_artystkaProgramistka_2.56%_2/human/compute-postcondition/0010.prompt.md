You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, na, nb, and nc are positive integers such that n_a + n_b + n_c = n and 1 <= n_a, n_b, n_c <= n-2. numbers is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= numbers[i] <= 10^9.
def func_2(n, na, nb, nc, numbers):
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    group_a, group_b, group_c = [], [], []
    sum_a, sum_b, sum_c = 0, 0, 0
    for num in numbers:
        distribute_number(num)
        
    #State: `group_a` contains the first, fourth, seventh, etc., numbers from `numbers` (up to `n_a` numbers), `group_b` contains the second, fifth, eighth, etc., numbers from `numbers` (up to `n_b` numbers), `group_c` contains the third, sixth, ninth, etc., numbers from `numbers` (up to `n_c` numbers), `sum_a` is the sum of the numbers in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the numbers in `group_b`, and `sum_c` is the sum of the numbers in `group_c`.
    if func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) :
        return 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
        #The program returns 'YES', along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. `group_a` contains the first, fourth, seventh, etc., numbers from `numbers` (up to `n_a` numbers), `group_b` contains the second, fifth, eighth, etc., numbers from `numbers` (up to `n_b` numbers), and `group_c` contains the third, sixth, ninth, etc., numbers from `numbers` (up to `n_c` numbers).
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n` and `1 <= na, nb, nc <= n-2`. `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9. The function returns 'YES' along with three lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` if it can successfully divide the `numbers` list into these groups according to the specified pattern: `group_a` contains the first, fourth, seventh, etc., numbers (up to `na` numbers), `group_b` contains the second, fifth, eighth, etc., numbers (up to `nb` numbers), and `group_c` contains the third, sixth, ninth, etc., numbers (up to `nc` numbers). If the division is not possible, the function returns 'NO'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'YES', along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. `group_a` contains the first, fourth, seventh, etc., numbers from `numbers` (up to `n_a` numbers), `group_b` contains the second, fifth, eighth, etc., numbers from `numbers` (up to `n_b` numbers), and `group_c` contains the third, sixth, ninth, etc., numbers from `numbers` (up to `n_c` numbers).

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
