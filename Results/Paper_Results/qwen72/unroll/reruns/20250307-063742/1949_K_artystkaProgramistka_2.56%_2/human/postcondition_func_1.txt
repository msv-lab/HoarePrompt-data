The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. It sorts the `numbers` list in descending order. The function then distributes the sorted numbers into three groups: `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`, where `group_a` contains the first, fourth, seventh, etc., numbers (up to `na` numbers), `group_b` contains the second, fifth, eighth, etc., numbers (up to `nb` numbers), and `group_c` contains the third, sixth, ninth, etc., numbers (up to `nc` numbers). The function calculates the sums of these groups (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, `sum_c`) and checks if a condition defined by `func_1` is met. If the condition is met, the function returns 'YES' along with the three groups. If the condition is not met, the function returns 'NO'.
