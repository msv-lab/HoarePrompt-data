You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: You are given n positive integers x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n and three positive
integers n_a, n_b, n_c satisfying n_a+n_b+n_c = n .

You want to split the n positive integers into three groups, so that:

  * The first group contains n_a numbers, the second group contains n_b numbers, the third group contains n_c numbers.
  * Let s_a be the sum of the numbers in the first group, s_b be the sum in the second group, and s_c be the sum in the third group. Then s_a, s_b, s_c are the sides of a triangle with positive area.

Determine if this is possible. If this is possible, find one way to do so.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1\le t\le 100\,000 ) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the t
test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains the integers n, n_a, n_b, n_c (3
\leq n \leq 200\,000, 1\leq n_a,n_b,n_c \leq n-2, n_a+n_b+n_c = n ) — the
number of integers to split into three groups, and the desired sizes of the
three groups.

The second line of each test case contains n integers x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n (1
\leq x_i \leq 10^{9} ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed
200\,000 .

Output

For each test case, print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to split the numbers
into three groups satisfying all the conditions. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO}
.

If such a split exists, then describe the three groups as follows.

On the next line, print n_a integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n_a} — the numbers
in the first group.

On the next line, print n_b integers b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{n_b} — the numbers
in the second group.

On the next line, print n_c integers c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_{n_c} — the numbers
in the third group.

These n_a+n_b+n_c=n integers should be a permutation of x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n
, and they should satisfy the conditions from the statement.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    6 2 2 2
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5 3 1 1
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    6 2 2 2
    
    1 1 1 1 1 3
    
    8 1 2 5
    
    16 1 1 1 1 1 1 12

Output

    YES
    1 1 
    1 1 
    1 1 
    NO
    NO
    YES
    16 
    12 1 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    
Note

In the first test case, we can put two 1 s into each group: the sum in each
group would be 2 , and there exists a triangle with positive area and sides 2
, 2 , 2 .

In the second and third test cases, it can be shown that there is no such way
to split numbers into groups.

In the fourth test case, we can put number 16 into the first group, with sum
16 , numbers 12 and 1 into the second group, with sum 13 , and the remaining
five 1 s into the third group, with sum 5 , as there exists a triangle with
positive area and sides 16, 13, 5 .
Program:
```
def distribute_number(num):
    nonlocal sum_a, sum_b, sum_c
    if len(group_a) < na or (len(group_a) == na and sum_a <= min(sum_b, sum_c)):
        group_a.append(num)
        sum_a += num
    elif len(group_b) < nb or (len(group_b) == nb and sum_b <= min(sum_a, sum_c)):
        group_b.append(num)
        sum_b += num
    else:
        group_c.append(num)
        sum_c += num
```
