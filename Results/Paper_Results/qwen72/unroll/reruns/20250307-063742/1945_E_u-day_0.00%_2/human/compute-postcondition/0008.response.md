Output State: **`pos` remains unchanged, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, and `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution.**

### Explanation:
- **`pos`**: The value of `pos` is not affected by the loop, so it remains the same as in the initial state.
- **`low`**: After the loop, `low` will be the largest index in `arr` such that `arr[low] <= k`. This is because the loop continuously updates `low` to be the midpoint when `arr[mid] <= k`, moving `low` closer to the position where `arr[low]` is just less than or equal to `k`.
- **`high`**: After the loop, `high` will be the smallest index in `arr` such that `arr[high] > k`. This is because the loop continuously updates `high` to be the midpoint when `arr[mid] > k`, moving `high` closer to the position where `arr[high]` is just greater than `k`.
- **`st`**: The set `st` will contain all the midpoints that were calculated during the loop execution. Each time the loop runs, `mid` is added to `st`, so `st` will have all the unique midpoints that were computed.
