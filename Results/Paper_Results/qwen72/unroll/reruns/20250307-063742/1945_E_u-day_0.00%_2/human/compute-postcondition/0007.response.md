To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables `low` and `high` because they are the only ones involved in the loop condition `low + 1 < high`.

### Initial State:
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n - 1`.
- `st` is an empty set.

### Loop Condition:
- The loop will execute if `low + 1 < high`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current Values**:
   - `low` is 0.
   - `high` is `n - 1`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `low + 1 < high` translates to `1 < high`.
   - For the loop to execute, `high` must be greater than 1.

3. **Adjustment**:
   - Since `high` is `n - 1`, for `high` to be greater than 1, `n - 1` must be greater than 1.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 2.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is 0; `high` is `n - 1` where `n` must be greater than 2; `st` is an empty set.**
