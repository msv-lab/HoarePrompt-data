Reasoning:

1. **Function Calls and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_3()`.
   - `func_1()` is used to read the integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   - `func_2()` is used to read the permutation `arr` from the input.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`:**
   - The program correctly finds the index `pos` of the element `k` in the permutation `arr`.

3. **Binary Search:**
   - The program initializes `low` and `high` to `0` and `n - 1` respectively.
   - It performs a binary search loop to find the position where `k` should be if the array were sorted.
   - The loop continues until `low + 1 < high`, which ensures that the search space is reduced to two elements.

4. **Output:**
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, the program prints `0` because no swaps are needed.
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, the program prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate a single swap operation.

5. **Correctness of the Binary Search:**
   - The binary search correctly identifies the position where `k` should be if the array were sorted.
   - The program then checks if `k` is at the position `low`. If it is, no swaps are needed.
   - If `k` is not at `low`, the program suggests swapping `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to place `k` at the correct position.

6. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop and calling `func_3()` for each test case.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle edge cases where `k` is at the beginning or end of the permutation.
   - The program should also handle cases where `k` is not in the permutation, but the problem guarantees that `k` is always in the permutation.

8. **Number of Swaps:**
   - The program only suggests one swap if `k` is not at the correct position, which is within the allowed limit of 2 swaps.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct in its approach to solving the problem. It correctly identifies the position of `k` and suggests a valid swap to place `k` at the correct position for the binary search to work.

Correctness: **True**
