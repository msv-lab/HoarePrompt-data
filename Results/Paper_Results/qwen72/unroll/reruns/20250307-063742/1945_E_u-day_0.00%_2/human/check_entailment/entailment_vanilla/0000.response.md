### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
   - We can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation before running a binary search.
   - The binary search should end with `p_l` being equal to `x`.

2. **Binary Search in a Permutation:**
   - Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
   - For binary search to work correctly, the array must be sorted.
   - However, in this problem, we are allowed to perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work.

3. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The program first finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation `arr`.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` to 0 and `n-1` respectively, which are the boundaries for the binary search.

4. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - The loop continues until `low + 1 < high`.
   - In each iteration, it calculates the middle index `mid`.
   - If `arr[mid] > x`, it updates `high` to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, it updates `low` to `mid`.

5. **Checking the Result:**
   - After the loop, it checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `x`.
   - If it is, the program prints 0, indicating no swaps were needed.
   - If it is not, the program prints 1, indicating one swap was performed, and the indices of the swap.

6. **Correctness of the Swap:**
   - The program swaps `arr[low]` with `arr[pos]` if `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`.
   - This ensures that `x` is moved to the position where the binary search will find it.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position by printing 0.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position by performing a single swap.

8. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one independently.
   - It correctly handles the input and output for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation and performs a single swap if necessary to ensure that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position. The logic is sound and handles the problem requirements as described.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
