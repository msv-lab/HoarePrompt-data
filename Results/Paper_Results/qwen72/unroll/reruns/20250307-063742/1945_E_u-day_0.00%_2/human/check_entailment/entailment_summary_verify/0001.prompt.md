You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters directly but relies on the outputs of `func_1` and `func_2` to determine the length of the permutation `n`, the number to be found `k`, and the permutation list `arr`. It searches for the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` and stores the index in `pos` (or -1 if `k` is not found). It then performs a binary search to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`. If `k` is found at `arr[low]`, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. The final state of the program includes `pos` (unchanged), `low` (the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`), `high` (the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`), and a set `st` containing all midpoints calculated during the binary search.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
   - We can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation before running a binary search.
   - The binary search should end with `p_l` being equal to `x`.

2. **Binary Search in a Permutation:**
   - Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
   - For binary search to work correctly, the array must be sorted.
   - However, in this problem, we are allowed to perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work.

3. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The program first finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation `arr`.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` to 0 and `n-1` respectively, which are the boundaries for the binary search.

4. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - The loop continues until `low + 1 < high`.
   - In each iteration, it calculates the middle index `mid`.
   - If `arr[mid] > x`, it updates `high` to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, it updates `low` to `mid`.

5. **Checking the Result:**
   - After the loop, it checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `x`.
   - If it is, the program prints 0, indicating no swaps were needed.
   - If it is not, the program prints 1, indicating one swap was performed, and the indices of the swap.

6. **Correctness of the Swap:**
   - The program swaps `arr[low]` with `arr[pos]` if `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`.
   - This ensures that `x` is moved to the position where the binary search will find it.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position by printing 0.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position by performing a single swap.

8. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one independently.
   - It correctly handles the input and output for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation and performs a single swap if necessary to ensure that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position. The logic is sound and handles the problem requirements as described.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
