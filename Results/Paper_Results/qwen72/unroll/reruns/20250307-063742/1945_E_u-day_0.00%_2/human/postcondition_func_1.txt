The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of valid operations, where each operation is a pair of indices, that can be used to rearrange a permutation to allow binary search to find the number `x`. The function assumes that `func_1` provides the necessary list of operations. After the function concludes, the returned list can be used to rearrange the permutation to enable binary search for the number `x`.
