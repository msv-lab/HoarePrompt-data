The function `func_3` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `arr`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n representing the number to be found, and `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size n. The function returns the index of `k` in the list `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, it returns -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `arr`, where `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `arr` is a list of integers of length `n`. It returns the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, it returns -1.**
