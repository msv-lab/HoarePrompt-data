Postcondition: ***`pos` remains unchanged, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, and `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution. Additionally, if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, then `arr[low]` is `k`. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.***
