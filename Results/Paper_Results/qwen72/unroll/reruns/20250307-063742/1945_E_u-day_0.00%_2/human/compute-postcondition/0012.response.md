The given `print` statement is `print(1)`. This statement simply prints the integer value 1. The precondition provides information about the state of the program, including the variables `pos`, `low`, `high`, and the list `st`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is only printing the integer 1, the output will be:

Output: **1**
