Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the permutation needs more than one swap to be rearranged such that the binary search algorithm can find the target value `x`. The program only performs one swap, which is insufficient for some test cases.

Example of a case where the program fails:
```
Input:
2
5 3
1 5 4 2 3
6 4
2 5 1 6 3 4

Expected Output:
2
2 4
1 3
2
1 3
4 6

Actual Output:
1
1 3
1
1 3
```

In the first test case, the permutation `[1, 5, 4, 2, 3]` needs two swaps to be rearranged such that the binary search can find `3` correctly. The program only performs one swap, which is insufficient. Similarly, in the second test case, the permutation `[2, 5, 1, 6, 3, 4]` also requires two swaps, but the program only performs one.
