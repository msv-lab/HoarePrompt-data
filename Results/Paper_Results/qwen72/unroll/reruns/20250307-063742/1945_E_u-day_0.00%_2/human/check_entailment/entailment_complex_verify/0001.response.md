### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using a binary search after performing at most 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.

2. **Binary Search in a Permutation:**
   - Binary search typically requires a sorted array. However, in this problem, we can perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work.

3. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The program correctly finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation `arr` using a linear search.

4. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - The binary search loop is implemented correctly. It initializes `low` and `high` to 0 and `n-1` respectively.
   - The loop continues until `low + 1 < high`, which ensures that the search interval is reduced to a single element.
   - In each iteration, it calculates the middle index `mid` and updates `low` or `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` with `x`.

5. **Checking the Result:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `x`.
   - If it is, the program prints 0, indicating no swaps were needed.
   - If it is not, the program prints 1, indicating one swap was performed, and the indices of the swap.

6. **Correctness of the Swap:**
   - The program swaps `arr[low]` with `arr[pos]` if `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`.
   - This swap ensures that `x` is moved to the position where the binary search will find it, which is `low`.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position by printing 0.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position by performing a single swap.

8. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one independently.
   - It correctly handles the input and output for each test case.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **Function 1:**
  - The function `func_1` reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and returns a map object of integers.
  - This is correct and matches the problem description.

- **Function 2:**
  - The function `func_2` converts the map object returned by `func_1` into a list.
  - This is correct and matches the problem description.

- **Function 3:**
  - The function `func_3` reads the length of the permutation `n` and the number to find `k` using `func_1`.
  - It reads the permutation `arr` using `func_2`.
  - It finds the position `pos` of `k` in `arr` using a linear search.
  - It initializes `low` and `high` to 0 and `n-1` respectively.
  - It performs a binary search loop to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`.
  - After the loop, it checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.
  - If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, it prints 0.
  - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it prints 1 followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Challenges to the Original Assessment:

- **Binary Search in an Unsorted Permutation:**
  - The binary search is performed on an unsorted permutation, which is not the typical use case for binary search.
  - However, the problem allows for up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work, and the program correctly identifies the position of `x` and performs a single swap if necessary.

- **Set `st` Usage:**
  - The set `st` is used to store midpoints calculated during the loop execution, but it is not used in the logic of the program.
  - This is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:

- The program correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation.
- It performs a binary search and correctly handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position by performing a single swap.
- The logic is sound and handles the problem requirements as described.

However, the set `st` is not necessary and can be removed to simplify the code.

Final: **True**
