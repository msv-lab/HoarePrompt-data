To determine what will be printed by the `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`pos` remains unchanged**: This means that the value of `pos` is the same as it was before the loop or any other operations that might have modified it.

2. **`low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`**: This means that `low` is the index of the last element in the list `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`.

3. **`high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`**: This means that `high` is the index of the first element in the list `arr` that is greater than `k`.

4. **`st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution**: This is not directly relevant to the `print` statement, but it provides context about the loop that might have determined `low` and `high`.

5. **`arr[low]` is not equal to `k`**: This means that the element at index `low` in the list `arr` is strictly less than `k`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print` statement:

- **`low + 1`**: Since `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `low + 1` will be the index of the first element in the list `arr` that is greater than `k` (which is `high`).

- **`pos + 1`**: Since `pos` remains unchanged, `pos + 1` will be the value of `pos` incremented by 1.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the values of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

Output: **high, pos + 1 (where high is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k` and pos is the unchanged value of `pos`)**
