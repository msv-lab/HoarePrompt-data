Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_3()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string by spaces, and returns a map object that converts each split element into an integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the map object is available for further processing, such as conversion to a list or iteration.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of valid operations, where each operation is a pair of indices, that can be used to rearrange a permutation to allow binary search to find the number `x`. The function assumes that `func_1` provides the necessary list of operations. After the function concludes, the returned list can be used to rearrange the permutation to enable binary search for the number `x`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    (low, high) = (0, n - 1)
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters directly but relies on the outputs of `func_1` and `func_2` to determine the length of the permutation `n`, the number to be found `k`, and the permutation list `arr`. It searches for the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` and stores the index in `pos` (or -1 if `k` is not found). It then performs a binary search to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`. If `k` is found at `arr[low]`, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. The final state of the program includes `pos` (unchanged), `low` (the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`), `high` (the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`), and a set `st` containing all midpoints calculated during the binary search.
