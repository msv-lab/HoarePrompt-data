Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n`.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_1()`. The variable `arr` remains unchanged and still represents a list of integers that is a permutation of size `n`.
