The function `solve` is part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes a permutation `p` of size `n` and an integer `x` to be found, where `1 <= x <= n <= 2 * 10^5`. The permutation `p` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4`. The function is expected to handle these inputs and produce the required output for each test case.
