Functionality: ** The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters directly but relies on the outputs of `func_1` and `func_2` to determine the length of the permutation `n`, the number to be found `k`, and the permutation list `arr`. It searches for the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` and stores the index in `pos` (or -1 if `k` is not found). It then performs a binary search to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`. If `k` is found at `arr[low]`, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. The final state of the program includes `pos` (unchanged), `low` (the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`), `high` (the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`), and a set `st` containing all midpoints calculated during the binary search. **
