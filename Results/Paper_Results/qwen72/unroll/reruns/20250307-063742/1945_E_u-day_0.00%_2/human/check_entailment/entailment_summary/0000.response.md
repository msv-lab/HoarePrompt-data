Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers. It is used to read the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case (n and x). The function works correctly as it returns a map object of integers, which can be unpacked into variables.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads another line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is the permutation. However, the function's name and description suggest it should return a list of valid operations to rearrange the permutation. This is a mismatch in the function's purpose and its actual implementation. The function should be named `read_permutation` or something similar to reflect its actual behavior.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function is the main logic of the program. It reads the test case parameters (n and k) using `func_1` and the permutation using `func_2`. It then searches for the position of `k` in the permutation and performs a binary search to find the correct position.

   - **Finding `k` in the permutation**: The function correctly finds the index `pos` where `k` is located in the permutation.
   - **Binary Search**: The binary search is performed to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`. This is a standard binary search implementation.
   - **Output**: If `k` is found at `arr[low]`, the function prints `0`, indicating no swaps are needed. If `k` is not found at `arr[low]`, the function prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, indicating a single swap is needed to move `k` to the correct position for binary search.

However, the problem description requires that the program can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation before running the binary search. The current implementation only performs 1 swap if necessary. This means the program might not always be able to rearrange the permutation correctly in all cases, especially if more than one swap is required to make the permutation suitable for binary search.

For example, consider the permutation `[3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]` and `x = 5`. The current implementation would only perform one swap, which might not be sufficient to make the permutation suitable for binary search.

Therefore, the program is **not** correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
