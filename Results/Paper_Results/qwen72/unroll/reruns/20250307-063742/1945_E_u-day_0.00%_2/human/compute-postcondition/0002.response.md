Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` as returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1.**

The code snippet initializes the variable `pos` to -1. The values of `n` and `k` remain as they were returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` remains as the list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` as returned by `func_2()`. The only change is that `pos` is now set to -1.
