Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers. It is used to read the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - The function returns a map object, which is then unpacked into `n` and `k` in `func_3`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads another line of input and converts it into a list of integers. It is used to read the permutation `p` for each test case.
   - The function returns a list of integers, which is then assigned to `arr` in `func_3`.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function is the main function that processes each test case.
   - It first reads the values of `n` and `k` using `func_1`.
   - It then reads the permutation `arr` using `func_2`.
   - It searches for the position of `k` in `arr` and stores it in `pos`.
   - It performs a binary search to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`.
   - If `k` is found at `arr[low]`, it prints `0` (indicating no swaps are needed).
   - If `k` is not found at `arr[low]`, it prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` (indicating one swap is needed to place `k` at the correct position for binary search).

**Issues and Analysis**:
- **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_3` is correct for finding the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`. However, the binary search is not designed to find the exact position of `k` in a sorted array, which is a common misunderstanding in binary search algorithms.
- **Swapping Logic**: The swapping logic is intended to place `k` at the correct position for binary search. However, the function assumes that `k` is already in the array and only needs to be moved to the correct position. This is a valid assumption given the problem constraints.
- **Output Format**: The output format is correct according to the problem statement. If `k` is found at `arr[low]`, it prints `0`. If not, it prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

**Conclusion**:
- The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- The binary search logic is appropriate for the given problem.
- The swapping logic is correctly implemented to ensure that `k` is placed in the correct position for binary search.
- The output format matches the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.
