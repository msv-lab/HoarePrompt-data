### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It then reads the list of moments `ls` when messages need to be sent.

2. **Charge Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through the list of moments `ls` starting from the second element.
   - For each pair of consecutive moments `ls[i]` and `ls[i-1]`, it calculates the charge lost either by:
     - Keeping the phone on for the duration between the two moments, which is `a * (ls[i] - ls[i-1])`.
     - Turning the phone off and on again, which costs `b` units of charge.
   - It updates the remaining charge `f` by subtracting the minimum of these two values.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After processing all the moments, the program checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0.
   - If `f > 0`, it prints "YES", indicating that Stepan can send all the messages.
   - If `f <= 0`, it prints "NO", indicating that Stepan cannot send all the messages.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly. In this case, the loop does not run, and the initial charge `f` is checked directly.
   - The program also handles large inputs and potential integer overflow by using Python's built-in integer type, which can handle arbitrarily large numbers.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The logic of the program is sound. It correctly simulates the charge consumption for each message and ensures that the phone has enough charge to send all messages.
   - The use of `min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i-1]), b)` ensures that the phone is turned off and on only when it is more efficient to do so, which is a correct approach to minimize charge loss.
