Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, f is an integer such that 1 ≤ f ≤ 10^9, a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, b is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, and m_1, m_2, ..., m_n are integers such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
