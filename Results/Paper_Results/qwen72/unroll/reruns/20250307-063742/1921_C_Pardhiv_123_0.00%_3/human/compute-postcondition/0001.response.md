The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Since `t` is already guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `f` is an integer such that 1 ≤ f ≤ 10^9, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, and `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
