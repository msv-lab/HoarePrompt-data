Output State: **t = 0, n remains unchanged, f is updated based on the loop's operations, a remains unchanged, b remains unchanged, ls is updated with the input list for each iteration.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, and the loop continues until `t` becomes 0. Therefore, after all iterations, `t` will be 0.
- The variable `n` is read from input at the start of each iteration and is not modified within the loop. Thus, its value remains unchanged from the input provided for each test case.
- The variable `f` is updated within the loop based on the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` and `b` for each pair of consecutive elements in the list `ls`. The final value of `f` depends on the input values and the operations performed in the loop.
- The variables `a` and `b` are read from input at the start of each iteration and are not modified within the loop. Thus, their values remain unchanged from the input provided for each test case.
- The list `ls` is read from input at the start of each iteration and is used to update `f` within the loop. The list `ls` is reinitialized with new input values for each iteration, so it will be the list provided in the last iteration of the loop.
