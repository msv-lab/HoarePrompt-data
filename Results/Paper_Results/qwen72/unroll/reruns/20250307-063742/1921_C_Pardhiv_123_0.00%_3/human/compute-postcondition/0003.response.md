Functionality: **The function `func` accepts multiple parameters: `t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and a list of integers `m` (where `m` contains `n` elements). The parameters have the following constraints: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `f` is an integer such that 1 ≤ f ≤ 10^9, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, and each element `m_i` in the list `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and the elements are strictly increasing. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.**
