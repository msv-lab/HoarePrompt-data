### Reasoning

#### Function 1: `func_1(n, p)`
- **Parameters**: `n` (initial number of players), `p` (sequence of integers to kick out players)
- **Logic**:
  - The function runs a loop as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
  - In each iteration, it calculates the number of players to be kicked out using a generator expression: `sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))`.
  - It subtracts this number from `n`.
  - The loop continues until `n` is less than the minimum value in `p`.
  - Finally, it returns the remaining number of players, which are the winners.

This function correctly implements the logic of the game. It keeps reducing the number of players by the number of players that should be kicked out in each round until no more players can be kicked out. The generator expression ensures that only the players that are still in the game (i.e., their positions are less than or equal to `n`) are considered for kicking out.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Logic**:
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`.
  - It reads the sequence `p` of integers.
  - It reads the list `qs` of initial player counts for which the number of winners needs to be determined.
  - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results.
  - For each initial player count `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to `res`.
  - It prints the results for the current test case.

The original assessment correctly identified the issues with the indentation and output format. The `print` statement should be outside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs` but inside the loop that processes each test case. This ensures that the results for all `n` in a test case are printed together.

### Corrected Function 2
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

  - Remaining players: `2`
- For the fourth test case:
  - `n = 1`, `p = [69, 96]`
  - Initial lineup: `A`
  - No players to kick out, so remaining players: `1`
  - `n = 10`, `p = [69, 96]`
  - Initial lineup: `ABCDEFGHIJ`
  - No players to kick out, so remaining players: `10`
  - `n = 100`, `p = [69, 96]`
  - Initial lineup: `100 players`
  - After first round: `31 players` (69 and 96 kicked out)
