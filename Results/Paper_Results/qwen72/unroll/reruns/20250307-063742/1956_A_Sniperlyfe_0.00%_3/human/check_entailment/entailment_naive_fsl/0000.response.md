Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input and output format correctly as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_2` prints the results immediately after each test case, rather than collecting all results and printing them at the end of each test case. Additionally, the program does not print the results in the correct format. According to the problem description, the output should be a single line of space-separated integers for each test case, but the program prints the results in a nested manner, which is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:

```python
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))
    return n

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that the results are collected and printed in the correct format for each test case.
