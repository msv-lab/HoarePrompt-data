### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Behavior**: The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and a sorted list `p` of integers. It repeatedly subtracts the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n` until `n` is less than the minimum value in `p`. The function then returns the modified value of `n`.
   - **Correctness**: This function correctly simulates the process of kicking out players based on the sequence `p` until no more players can be kicked out. The loop ensures that the process continues as long as there are players that can be kicked out, and the final value of `n` represents the number of players remaining, which is the number of winners.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Behavior**: The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of integers `qs`. It then calls `func_1` for each integer in `qs` and appends the result to a list `res`. After processing all integers in `qs`, it prints the list `res` as a space-separated string.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each test case as described in the problem. It reads the input, calls `func_1` for each `n` in `qs`, and prints the results. However, there is a minor issue in the code: the `print` statement should be outside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs` to ensure that the results for all `n` in `qs` are printed together for each test case.

### Correctness:
- **Function `func_1`**: Correct.
- **Function `func_2`**: Almost correct, but the `print` statement should be outside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs`.

### Conclusion:
The program is **almost correct** but has a minor issue with the placement of the `print` statement in `func_2`. To fix this, the `print` statement should be moved outside the loop that appends results to `res`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))
    return n

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))  # Moved outside the loop
```

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False** (due to the minor issue with the `print` statement placement).

If the `print` statement is moved outside the loop as suggested, the program would be **Correct**.
