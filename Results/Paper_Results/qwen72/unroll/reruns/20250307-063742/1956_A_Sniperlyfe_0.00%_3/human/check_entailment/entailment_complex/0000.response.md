### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the process of kicking out players based on the sequence `p` until no more players can be kicked out.
   - The while loop continues as long as `n` (the number of players) is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `p`.
   - Inside the loop, the function subtracts the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n`. This simulates the removal of players at positions specified by `p`.
   - The function returns the final value of `n`, which represents the number of players left after the game ends.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, followed by the sequence `p` and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results.
   - For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to `res`.
   - It prints the results for each test case after processing all `n` values in `qs`.

### Issues:
- **Printing Inside the Loop**:
  - The function `func_2` prints the results inside the loop where it processes each `n` in `qs`. This means that the results are printed prematurely, and the final output for each test case is not complete.
  - The correct approach would be to print the results after all `n` values in `qs` have been processed for a given test case.

### Corrected Function `func_2`:
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = []
        
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Conclusion:
- The original function `func_2` is incorrect because it prints the results inside the loop, leading to incomplete output for each test case.
- The function `func_1` is correct and correctly simulates the game.

### Correctness:
**False**
