Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the placement of the `print` statement within `func_2`. The `print` statement is inside the loop that iterates over each `n` in `qs`, which means it will print the results after processing each `n` individually, rather than printing all results for a test case at once. This will cause the output to be incorrect and not in the expected format.

To fix this, the `print` statement should be moved outside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs`, so that it prints the results for all `n` values in `qs` after they have been processed. Here is the corrected version of `func_2`:

```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

With this correction, the program should produce the correct output format as specified in the problem description.
