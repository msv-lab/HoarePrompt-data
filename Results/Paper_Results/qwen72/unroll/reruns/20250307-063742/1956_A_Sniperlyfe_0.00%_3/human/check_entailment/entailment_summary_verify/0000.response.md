### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, followed by the sequence `p` and the list of queries `qs`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(n, p)` is responsible for simulating the game for a given number of players `n` and the sequence `p`.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly remove players from the game based on the sequence `p` until no more players can be removed.
   - The loop condition `while n >= min(p)` ensures that the game continues as long as there are enough players to be removed according to the smallest value in `p`.
   - The line `n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))` correctly calculates the number of players to be removed in each round by summing up the number of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The function `func_2` collects the results of each query in the list `res` and prints them as a space-separated string using `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))`.
   - However, the original assessment correctly points out that the results are printed immediately after each test case, rather than collecting all results and printing them at the end of each test case.

4. **Corrected Version**:
   - The corrected version of the program ensures that the results are collected in a list `res` and printed in the correct format at the end of each test case.
   - This corrected version aligns with the problem description's requirement for output format.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is **accurate**. The program as originally written does not handle the input and output format correctly, specifically in the way it prints the results.
- The corrected version provided in the original assessment is the correct way to handle the input and output format.

### Final: **False**
