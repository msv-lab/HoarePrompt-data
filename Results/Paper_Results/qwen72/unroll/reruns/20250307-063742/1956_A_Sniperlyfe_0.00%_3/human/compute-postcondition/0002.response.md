Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations. `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of `k` positive integers where 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100, `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers where 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q. The variable `res` is a list of results from the function `func_1` applied to each element in `qs` with the list `p` as the second argument, and this list is printed for each iteration of the loop.**
