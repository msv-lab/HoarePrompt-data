Reasoning: 

The original assessment is correct. The primary issue with the provided program is that it prints the results immediately after each test case, rather than collecting all results and printing them at the end of each test case. This is a violation of the problem's specified output format, which requires that for each test case, the results (i.e., the number of winners for each `n_i`) be printed on a single line as space-separated integers.

Let's break down the issues and the reasoning:

1. **Immediate Printing of Results**:
   - In the original `func_2`, the line `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))` is inside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs`. This means that the results are printed immediately after each `n` is processed, leading to nested and incorrect output.
   - The corrected version moves the `print` statement outside the loop, ensuring that all results for a test case are collected in `res` and then printed on a single line.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The problem description clearly states that the output should be a single line of space-separated integers for each test case.
   - The original program does not adhere to this format, as it prints results prematurely and in a nested manner.

3. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` itself is correctly implemented to simulate the game and return the number of players left after all rounds.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is sound and follows the problem's rules.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect due to the improper handling of input and output format.

Final: **False**
