Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 250`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads two integers `k` and `q` (both between 1 and 100), followed by a list `p` of `k` strictly increasing positive integers (each between 1 and 100), and a list `qs` of `q` positive integers (each between 1 and 100). For each integer `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to a list `res`. After processing all integers in `qs`, it prints the list `res` as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value. **
