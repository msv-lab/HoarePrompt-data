The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and a sorted list of integers `p` (where each element is between 1 and 100). It repeatedly subtracts the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n` until `n` is less than the minimum value in `p`. The function then returns the modified value of `n`, which is guaranteed to be less than the smallest element in the list `p`.
