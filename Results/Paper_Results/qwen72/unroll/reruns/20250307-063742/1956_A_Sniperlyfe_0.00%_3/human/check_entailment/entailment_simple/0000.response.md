### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate a single game with `n` players and a sequence `p` of positions to be removed.
   - The while loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `p`. This ensures that the game continues until no more players can be removed.
   - Inside the loop, `n` is decremented by the number of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`. This correctly simulates the removal of players from the game.
   - Once the loop exits, `n` is less than the smallest value in `p`, and the function returns `n`, which represents the number of players remaining in the game.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results for each initial player count.
   - For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to determine the number of winners and appends the result to `res`.
   - However, the program prints the results inside the loop, which means it prints the results after each `n` is processed, rather than after all `n` values have been processed for a given test case. This is incorrect because the output should be printed once per test case, not after each individual `n`.

3. **Output Issues**:
   - The output should be printed once per test case, not after each individual `n` is processed. The current implementation prints the results prematurely, which will lead to incorrect output formatting.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it prints the results inside the loop, leading to premature and incorrect output formatting. The correct implementation should collect all results for a test case and print them at the end of the test case.
