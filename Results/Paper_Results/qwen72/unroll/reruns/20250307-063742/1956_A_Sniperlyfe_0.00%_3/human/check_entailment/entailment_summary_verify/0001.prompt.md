You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_k .

In this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds
of this game, the following happens:

  * Nene finds the a_1 -th, a_2 -th, \ldots , a_k -th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i -th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. 

Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are
still in the game are declared as winners.

For example, consider the game with a=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players
be named player A, player B, \ldots , player E in the order they are lined up
initially. Then,

  * Before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round. 
  * Now players are lined up as ABD. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. The 3 -rd player is player D and there is no 5 -th player in a row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round. 
  * In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. 
  * Players A and B are declared as the winners. 

Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene
gave you q integers n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_q and you should answer the following
question for each 1 \le i \le q independently:

  * How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially? 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 250 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line case contains two integers k and q (1 \le k, q \le 100 ) — the
length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this
problem for.

The second line contains k integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k (1\leq
a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_k\leq 100 ) — the sequence a .

The third line contains q integers n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_q (1\leq n_i \leq 100 ).

Output

For each test case, output q integers: the i -th (1\le i \le q ) of them
should be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players
join the game.

Note

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, when n=1 , the only player stays in the game in the
first round. After that, the game ends and the only player is declared as a
winner.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))
    return n

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 250`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads two integers `k` and `q` (both between 1 and 100), followed by a list `p` of `k` strictly increasing positive integers (each between 1 and 100), and a list `qs` of `q` positive integers (each between 1 and 100). For each integer `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to a list `res`. After processing all integers in `qs`, it prints the list `res` as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The problem involves a game where players are lined up in a row, and in each round, specific players are kicked out based on a sequence of integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k\). The game continues until no more players can be kicked out. The goal is to determine the number of winners for different initial numbers of players \(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_q\).

### Program Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1(n, p)`
- **Parameters**: `n` (initial number of players), `p` (sequence of integers to kick out players)
- **Logic**:
  - The function runs a loop as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
  - In each iteration, it calculates the number of players to be kicked out using a generator expression: `sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))`.
  - It subtracts this number from `n`.
  - The loop continues until `n` is less than the minimum value in `p`.
  - Finally, it returns the remaining number of players, which are the winners.

This function correctly implements the logic of the game. It keeps reducing the number of players by the number of players that should be kicked out in each round until no more players can be kicked out.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Logic**:
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`.
  - It reads the sequence `p` of integers.
  - It reads the list `qs` of initial player counts for which the number of winners needs to be determined.
  - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results.
  - For each initial player count `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to `res`.
  - It prints the results for the current test case.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Indentation and Scope**:
   - The `print` statement inside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs` is incorrectly indented. It should be outside the loop that processes each `n` but inside the loop that processes each test case.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The `print` statement should be outside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs` to ensure that the results for all `n` in a test case are printed together.

### Corrected Function 2
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Conclusion
The logic in `func_1` is correct, and the corrected `func_2` will ensure that the output format matches the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct after fixing the indentation and output format issues.
