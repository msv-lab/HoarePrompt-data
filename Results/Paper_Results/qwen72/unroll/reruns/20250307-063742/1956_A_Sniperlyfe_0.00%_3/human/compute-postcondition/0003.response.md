The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`. 

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 250.
- `k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100.
- `p` is a list of `k` positive integers where 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100.
- `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers where 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q.

The function returns a list of results based on the input parameters. However, the specific output based on these parameters is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 250), two positive integers `k` and `q` (1 <= k, q <= 100), a list `p` of `k` strictly increasing positive integers (1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100), and a list `qs` of `q` positive integers (1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q). The function returns a list of results based on these inputs.**
