You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        i += 1
    if nn > 1:
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    primes = list(factors.keys())

    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor

#Function 2:
def generate(k):
    if k == len(primes):
        yield 1
    else:
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield (factor * prime_to_i)
                prime_to_i *= prime



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `generate` is a generator that accepts a non-negative integer `k` and yields a sequence of numbers. If `k` is equal to the length of the `primes` list, it yields the value 1. Otherwise, it yields a sequence of numbers that are the product of the factors of the primes in the list up to the `k`-th prime, raised to the power of their corresponding values in the `factors` dictionary plus one. The function does not modify the input variables `k`, `rest`, or `primes`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the generator has produced its sequence of values, and the original variables remain unchanged.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Settling Pattern**:
   - The pattern of numbers repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - The first \(k\) positions are numbered \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, k\).
   - The next \(k - 2\) positions are numbered \(k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2\).
   - This pattern repeats.

2. **Constraints**:
   - \(1 \leq t \leq 100\) (number of test cases).
   - \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\) (Vasya's position and the number he received).

3. **Objective**:
   - Determine the number of different \(k\) values that fit the given constraints for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1: `func_1(n)`**:
   - This function is intended to find the factors of \(n\) and then generate all possible factors of \(n\).
   - It uses a dictionary `factors` to store the prime factorization of \(n\).
   - It then calls the `generate` function to yield all possible factors of \(n\).

2. **Function 2: `generate(k)`**:
   - This function is a recursive generator that generates all possible factors of \(n\) based on its prime factorization.
   - It uses the `primes` list and the `factors` dictionary to generate factors.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - The prime factorization part in `func_1` is correct. It correctly identifies and counts the prime factors of \(n\).

2. **Factor Generation**:
   - The `generate` function is a recursive generator that correctly generates all possible factors of \(n\) based on its prime factorization.

3. **Settling Pattern Check**:
   - The program does not include any logic to check if the generated \(k\) values fit the settling pattern.
   - Specifically, it does not check if \(x\) is a valid number in the settling pattern for the given \(n\) and \(k\).

4. **Output**:
   - The program does not output the number of valid \(k\) values for each test case.
   - It only generates factors of \(n\), which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

### Correct Solution:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Generate all possible \(k\) values.
2. Check if \(x\) is a valid number in the settling pattern for each \(k\).
3. Count the number of valid \(k\) values.

### Correctness:
The given program does not implement the necessary logic to check the settling pattern and count valid \(k\) values. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
