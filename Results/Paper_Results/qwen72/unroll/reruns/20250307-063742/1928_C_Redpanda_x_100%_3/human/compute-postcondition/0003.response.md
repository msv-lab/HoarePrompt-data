Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)`.** 

In natural language: The value of `k` remains a non-negative integer within the range 0 to the length of the `primes` list minus one. The variable `rest` now holds the value returned by the function `generate` when called with the argument `k + 1`.
