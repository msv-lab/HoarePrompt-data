Postcondition: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where `primes` is a list of prime numbers. If `k` is equal to the length of the `primes` list, the generator has yielded the value 1. Otherwise, the loop yields a sequence of values, but the variables `k`, `rest`, and `primes` remain unchanged. The variable `prime_to_i` is reset to 1 for each `factor` in `rest`, and its final value after each inner loop iteration is `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`.**
