Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    primes = list(factors.keys())
    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor
        
    #State: The loop does not modify the variables `nn`, `factors`, `i`, or `primes`. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state: `nn` is the largest prime factor of `n`, `factors` is a dictionary containing the prime factors of `n` and their respective counts, `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n` that is not a factor of `n`, and `primes` is a list of the prime factors of `n` (keys from the `factors` dictionary).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 < n <= 10^9) and returns a generator that yields the prime factors of `n`. After the function concludes, `nn` is the largest prime factor of `n`, `factors` is a dictionary containing the prime factors of `n` and their respective counts, and `primes` is a list of the prime factors of `n` (keys from the `factors` dictionary). The function does not modify the input `n`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where `primes` is a list of prime numbers.
def generate(k):
    if (k == len(primes)) :
        yield 1
    else :

                yield factor * prime_to_i
                prime_to_i *= prime
            
        #State: The loop has no direct effect on the variables `k`, `rest`, and `primes`. The loop yields a sequence of values, but the variables `k`, `rest`, and `primes` remain unchanged. The variable `prime_to_i` is reset to 1 for each `factor` in `rest`, and its final value after each inner loop iteration is `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`.
    #State: `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where `primes` is a list of prime numbers. If `k` is equal to the length of the `primes` list, the generator has yielded the value 1. Otherwise, the loop yields a sequence of values, but the variables `k`, `rest`, and `primes` remain unchanged. The variable `prime_to_i` is reset to 1 for each `factor` in `rest`, and its final value after each inner loop iteration is `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `generate` is a generator that accepts a non-negative integer `k` and yields a sequence of numbers. If `k` is equal to the length of the `primes` list, it yields the value 1. Otherwise, it yields a sequence of numbers that are the product of the factors of the primes in the list up to the `k`-th prime, raised to the power of their corresponding values in the `factors` dictionary plus one. The function does not modify the input variables `k`, `rest`, or `primes`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the generator has produced its sequence of values, and the original variables remain unchanged.
