### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem involves a specific pattern of numbering in a line, where the first `k` people are numbered from 1 to `k`, the next `k-2` people are numbered from `k-1` to 2, and this pattern repeats every `2k-2` positions.
   - We need to determine how many different values of `k` fit the given position `n` and number `x` received by Vasya.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it calculates two values `h` and `h2` based on `n` and `x`.
   - It then uses a generator function `func_1` to find all possible values of `k` that fit the constraints.
   - The generator function `func_1` is used to find all factors of `h` and `h2` that are even and satisfy the condition `k / 2 + 1 >= x`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the prime factors of `n` and stores them in a dictionary `factors`.
   - It then uses a recursive generator function `generate` to yield all possible products of these prime factors.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find all factors of `n`, but it specifically yields only even factors that satisfy the condition `k / 2 + 1 >= x`.

4. **Function `generate`**:
   - This function is a recursive generator that yields all possible products of the prime factors.
   - It ensures that the factors are even by checking `not k % 2` and that they satisfy the condition `k / 2 + 1 >= x`.

5. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program logic correctly calculates `h` and `h2` based on the given `n` and `x`.
   - It then uses `func_1` to find all valid `k` values for both `h` and `h2`.
   - The results are combined using the `union` method and the length of the resulting set is printed.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `x == 1` separately, which is correct because the pattern for `x == 1` is different from other values.
   - The program also ensures that `k > 1`, which is a requirement of the problem.

7. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the pattern and the constraints for `k`.
   - The use of sets to avoid duplicate values and the union operation to combine results from both `h` and `h2` is appropriate.
   - The logic for generating factors and checking the conditions is sound.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments. It correctly identifies the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
