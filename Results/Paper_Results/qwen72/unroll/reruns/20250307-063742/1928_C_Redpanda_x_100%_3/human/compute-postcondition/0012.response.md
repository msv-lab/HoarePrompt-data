Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 < n <= 10^9) and returns a generator that yields the prime factors of `n`. After the function concludes, `nn` is the largest prime factor of `n`, `factors` is a dictionary containing the prime factors of `n` and their respective counts, and `primes` is a list of the prime factors of `n` (keys from the `factors` dictionary). The function does not modify the input `n`. **
