You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a binary string (a string consisting of only 0s and 1s) with a length of 2 to 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: `s` is a list containing each character from the binary string `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: `s` is a list with all '1's moved to the right and all '0's moved to the left, `left` is the index of the first '1' in the list (or equal to `len(s)` if there are no '1's), `right` is the index of the first '0' after the last '1' (or equal to `len(s)` if there are no '0's), and `cost` is the total number of swaps made to rearrange the list.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total number of swaps made to rearrange the list `s` so that all '1's are moved to the right and all '0's are moved to the left.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a binary string `sChar` and returns the total number of swaps required to rearrange the string so that all '0's are moved to the left and all '1's are moved to the right. After the function concludes, the input string `sChar` remains unchanged, and the function does not modify any external state. The function effectively calculates the minimum number of swaps needed to achieve the desired rearrangement.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the string contains multiple '1's followed by multiple '0's. For example, consider the input string "111000". The expected output is 6, as the optimal strategy involves cyclically shifting the entire string once. However, the program will output 0, which is incorrect.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the issue:
1. The program initializes `left` to 0 and `right` to 1.
2. It enters the main while loop and checks if `s[right] == '0'` and `s[left] == '1'`.
3. In the string "111000", the first '0' is at index 3, and the first '1' is at index 0.
4. The program will swap `s[3]` and `s[0]`, resulting in the string "011100".
5. It will then increment `right` to 4 and `left` to 1.
6. The next '0' is at index 4, and the next '1' is at index 1.
7. The program will swap `s[4]` and `s[1]`, resulting in the string "001110".
8. It will then increment `right` to 5 and `left` to 2.
9. The next '0' is at index 5, and the next '1' is at index 2.
10. The program will swap `s[5]` and `s[2]`, resulting in the string "000111".
11. The program will then exit the loop and return the cost, which is 0.

The correct cost for the string "111000" should be 6, as the entire string needs to be cyclically shifted once to become sorted. The program fails to account for this and other similar cases where multiple '1's are followed by multiple '0's.
