Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` attempts to sort the binary string by swapping '0's and '1's, but it does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to achieve the minimum total cost. The logic in the function is flawed and does not guarantee the minimum cost to sort the string.

Here is a more detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Swapping Mechanism**: The program swaps '0's and '1's directly, which is not a cyclic shift. A cyclic shift moves the last character of a substring to the front, not just swaps two characters.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation is based on the number of swaps, which is not the same as the cost of cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The program does not follow the optimal strategy to minimize the total cost. It should consider the positions of '1's and '0's and the length of the substrings that need to be cyclically shifted to achieve the sorted order.

A correct approach would involve identifying the positions of '1's and '0's and calculating the minimum cost to move all '1's to the front of the string. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    ones = s.count('1')
    cost = float('inf')
    
    # Count the number of '1's in the initial window
    current_ones = s[:ones].count('1')
    
    # Initial cost for the first window
    cost = min(cost, ones - current_ones)
    
    # Slide the window and update the cost
    for i in range(ones, n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            current_ones += 1
        if s[i - ones] == '1':
            current_ones -= 1
        cost = min(cost, ones - current_ones)
    
    return cost

t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(min_cost_to_sort(s))
    t -= 1
```

This corrected program uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string. It calculates the number of '1's in the initial window and then slides the window across the string, updating the cost as it goes. This ensures that the program finds the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order.
