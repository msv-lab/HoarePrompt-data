Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a binary string `sChar` and returns the total number of swaps required to rearrange the string so that all '0's are moved to the left and all '1's are moved to the right. After the function concludes, the input string `sChar` remains unchanged, and the function does not modify any external state. The function effectively calculates the minimum number of swaps needed to achieve the desired rearrangement. **
