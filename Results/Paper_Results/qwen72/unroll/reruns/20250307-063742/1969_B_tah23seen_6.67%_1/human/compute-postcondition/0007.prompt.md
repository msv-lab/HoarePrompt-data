Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a list containing each character from the binary string `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`, `left` is 0, `cost` is 0, `right` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while left <= right and right < len(s) and left < len(s):
    if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
        s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
        cost += right - left + 1
    while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
        right += 1
    while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
        left += 1



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
