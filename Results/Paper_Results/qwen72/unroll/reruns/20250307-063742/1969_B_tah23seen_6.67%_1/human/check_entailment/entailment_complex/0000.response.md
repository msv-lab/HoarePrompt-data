**Reasoning:**

The program aims to determine the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any chosen substring. The function `func_1` is designed to achieve this by swapping '0's and '1's in the string and calculating the cost of each swap.

However, there are a few issues in the implementation that affect the correctness of the program:

1. **Swapping Mechanism**: The program swaps characters when it finds a '1' at the left index and a '0' at the right index. This approach does not necessarily simulate a cyclic shift but rather a direct swap, which is not the same operation as described in the problem statement.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost is calculated as `right - left + 1` for each swap. This is the correct cost for a cyclic shift of the substring from `left` to `right`. However, the program does not actually perform a cyclic shift; it performs a direct swap, which might not be the most efficient way to achieve the sorted string.

3. **Termination Conditions**: The while loop conditions are not optimal. The loop should continue until the string is fully sorted, but the current conditions might terminate prematurely if `left` and `right` indices are not properly managed.

4. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy to sort the string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts is to find the first '1' in the string and then cyclically shift the substring starting from this '1' to the end of the string. The cost of this operation is the length of the substring, which is the number of characters from the first '1' to the end of the string.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the cyclic shift operation as described in the problem statement, and it may not always find the minimum cost to sort the string.

**Correctness: **False****

To correctly solve the problem, the program should identify the first '1' in the string and then calculate the cost of a cyclic shift from this position to the end of the string. This approach ensures that the string is sorted in the minimum number of operations.
