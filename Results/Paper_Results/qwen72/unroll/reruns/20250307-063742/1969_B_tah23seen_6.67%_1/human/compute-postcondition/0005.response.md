Output State: **`s` is a list containing each character from the binary string `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`, `left` is 0, `cost` is 0, `right` is 1.** 

The code snippet assigns the value 1 to the variable `right`. The other variables `s`, `left`, and `cost` remain unchanged from their initial state.
