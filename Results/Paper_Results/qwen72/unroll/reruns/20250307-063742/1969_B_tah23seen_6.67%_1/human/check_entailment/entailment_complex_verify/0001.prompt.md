You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:

    t = t - 1

def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            (s[right], s[left]) = (s[left], s[right])

            right += 1
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a binary string (a string consisting of only 0s and 1s) with a length of 2 to 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: `s` is a list containing each character from the binary string `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: `s` is a list with all '1's moved to the right and all '0's moved to the left, `left` is the index of the first '1' in the list (or equal to `len(s)` if there are no '1's), `right` is the index of the first '0' after the last '1' (or equal to `len(s)` if there are no '0's), and `cost` is the total number of swaps made to rearrange the list.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total number of swaps made to rearrange the list `s` so that all '1's are moved to the right and all '0's are moved to the left.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a binary string `sChar` and returns the total number of swaps required to rearrange the string so that all '0's are moved to the left and all '1's are moved to the right. After the function concludes, the input string `sChar` remains unchanged, and the function does not modify any external state. The function effectively calculates the minimum number of swaps needed to achieve the desired rearrangement.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description. The program is supposed to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and calls the function `func_1` to compute the minimum cost.
   - The result of `func_1` is printed for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a binary string `sChar` as input.
   - It converts the string `sChar` into a list `s` to facilitate character swapping.
   - It initializes `left` to 0, `cost` to 0, and `right` to 1.
   - The program then enters a loop to find and swap '1's and '0's to sort the string.

3. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop condition is `while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s))`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1'. If so, it swaps these characters and increments the cost by the length of the substring being shifted (`right - left + 1`).
   - After the swap, it moves `right` to the next '0' and `left` to the next '1' using nested while loops.

4. **Termination and Correctness:**
   - The loop terminates when `right` is no longer less than `len(s)` or when `left` is no longer less than `len(s)`.
   - The function returns the total cost.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Swapping Logic:**
  - The program correctly identifies the positions of '1's and '0's that need to be swapped to sort the string.
  - Each swap is performed on the smallest possible substring that contains both a '1' and a '0', which is optimal in terms of minimizing the cost.

- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost is calculated as `right - left + 1` for each swap, which is the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.
  - This cost calculation is correct based on the problem description.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If the string is already sorted, the program will not perform any swaps, and the cost will be 0.
  - The program handles strings of length 2 correctly, as shown in the example.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program uses a two-pointer approach to find and swap '1's and '0's, which is efficient for the given constraints.
  - The nested while loops ensure that the program does not perform unnecessary operations.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for sorting a binary string using cyclic shifts and calculating the minimum total cost. It handles all edge cases and efficiently processes the input.
