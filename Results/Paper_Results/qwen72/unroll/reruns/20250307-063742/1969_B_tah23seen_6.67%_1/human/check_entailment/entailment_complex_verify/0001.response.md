### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading a binary string `s` and calling `func_1` to compute the minimum cost.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` converts the binary string `sChar` into a list `s` to facilitate character swapping.
   - It initializes `left` to 0, `cost` to 0, and `right` to 1.

3. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop condition `while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s))` ensures that the loop continues as long as there are '1's to the left of '0's and both pointers are within the bounds of the string.
   - Inside the loop, the program checks if `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1'. If so, it swaps these characters and increments the cost by the length of the substring being shifted (`right - left + 1`).
   - After the swap, it moves `right` to the next '0' and `left` to the next '1' using nested while loops.

4. **Termination and Correctness:**
   - The loop terminates when `right` is no longer less than `len(s)` or when `left` is no longer less than `len(s)`.
   - The function returns the total cost.

5. **Analysis of the Algorithm:**
   - **Swapping Logic:**
     - The program correctly identifies the positions of '1's and '0's that need to be swapped to sort the string.
     - Each swap is performed on the smallest possible substring that contains both a '1' and a '0', which is optimal in terms of minimizing the cost.
   - **Cost Calculation:**
     - The cost is calculated as `right - left + 1` for each swap, which is the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.
     - This cost calculation is correct based on the problem description.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - If the string is already sorted, the program will not perform any swaps, and the cost will be 0.
     - The program handles strings of length 2 correctly, as shown in the example.
   - **Efficiency:**
     - The program uses a two-pointer approach to find and swap '1's and '0's, which is efficient for the given constraints.
     - The nested while loops ensure that the program does not perform unnecessary operations.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not handle the case where all characters are the same (all '0's or all '1's) explicitly, but it will still return 0 cost correctly.
   - The program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted but has a different structure (e.g., '0011' instead of '1100') explicitly, but it will still return the correct cost.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for sorting a binary string using cyclic shifts and calculating the minimum total cost. It handles all edge cases and efficiently processes the input.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
