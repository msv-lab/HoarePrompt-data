The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sChar`. `sChar` is a binary string (a string consisting of only 0s and 1s) with a length between 2 and 2 \cdot 10^5. After executing the function body, the function returns the total number of swaps made to rearrange the string `sChar` so that all '1's are moved to the right and all '0's are moved to the left.

Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string `sChar` and returns the total number of swaps required to rearrange the string so that all '0's are on the left and all '1's are on the right.**
