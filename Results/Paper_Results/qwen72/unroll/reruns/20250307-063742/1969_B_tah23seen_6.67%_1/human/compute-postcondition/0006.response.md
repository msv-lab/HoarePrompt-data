To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

1. `left <= right`
2. `right < len(s)`
3. `left < len(s)`

Given the program state:
- `s` is a list containing each character from the binary string `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`.
- `left` is 0.
- `cost` is 0 (though this is not relevant to the loop condition).
- `right` is 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`left <= right`**:
   - `left` is 0 and `right` is 1, so this condition is already satisfied.

2. **`right < len(s)`**:
   - `right` is 1, so `len(s)` must be greater than 1 for this condition to be true.

3. **`left < len(s)`**:
   - `left` is 0, so `len(s)` must be greater than 0 for this condition to be true.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `len(s)`. For the loop to execute the first time, `len(s)` must be greater than 1.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`s` is a list containing each character from the binary string `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar` and `len(s)` must be greater than 1, `left` is 0, `cost` is 0, `right` is 1**
