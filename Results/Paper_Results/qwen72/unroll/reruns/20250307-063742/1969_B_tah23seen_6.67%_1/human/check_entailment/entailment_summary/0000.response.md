Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of sorting a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings, with the goal of minimizing the total cost of these operations. The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the minimum cost.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading a binary string `s` for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1(s)` for each string and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function converts the input string `sChar` into a list `s` to facilitate swapping.
   - It initializes `left` and `right` pointers to 0 and 1, respectively, and a `cost` variable to 0.
   - The function enters a loop where it checks if `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1'. If so, it swaps these characters and updates the cost.
   - It then moves the `right` pointer to the next '0' and the `left` pointer to the next '1'.
   - The loop continues until the `right` pointer exceeds the length of the string or the `left` pointer is no longer less than or equal to the `right` pointer.

### Issues and Correctness:
- **Swapping Logic:**
  - The swapping logic is correct in the sense that it identifies and swaps '0's and '1's to move '0's to the left and '1's to the right.
  - However, the cost calculation is incorrect. The cost of a cyclic shift of a substring is the length of the substring, not the distance between the `left` and `right` pointers.

- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost should be calculated as the length of the substring being shifted, which is `right - left + 1`.
  - The current implementation correctly calculates the cost for each swap, but the logic for moving the pointers and identifying the substrings to shift is flawed.

- **Pointer Movement:**
  - The `right` pointer is moved to the next '0' and the `left` pointer is moved to the next '1' after each swap.
  - This approach may not always find the optimal substrings to shift, especially in cases where there are multiple '0's and '1's in the string.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach to solving this problem is to identify the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to move all '0's to the left and all '1's to the right.
- One efficient way to do this is to count the number of '0's and '1's and then determine the minimum cost by considering the positions of the '1's and '0's.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string. The cost calculation is based on the distance between the `left` and `right` pointers, which does not accurately represent the cost of cyclic shifts. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
