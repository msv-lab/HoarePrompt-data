Output State: **`s` is a list with all '1's moved to the right and all '0's moved to the left, `left` is the index of the first '1' in the list (or equal to `len(s)` if there are no '1's), `right` is the index of the first '0' after the last '1' (or equal to `len(s)` if there are no '0's), and `cost` is the total number of swaps made to rearrange the list.**

In simpler terms:
- The list `s` will have all '0's at the beginning and all '1's at the end.
- The variable `left` will point to the first '1' in the list, or to the end of the list if there are no '1's.
- The variable `right` will point to the first '0' after the last '1', or to the end of the list if there are no '0's.
- The variable `cost` will be the total number of swaps that were performed to rearrange the list.
