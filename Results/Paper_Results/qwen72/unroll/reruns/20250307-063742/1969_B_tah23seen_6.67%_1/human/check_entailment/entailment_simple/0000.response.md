Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the binary strings for each test case. It processes each test case by calling `func_1(s)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `s` and appends each character from the input string `sChar` to it. This effectively converts the string into a list of characters.
   - **Variables**: The variables `left`, `cost`, and `right` are initialized to 0, 0, and 1, respectively.
   - **Main Loop**: The loop continues as long as `left <= right` and both indices are within the bounds of the list `s`.
     - **Condition Check**: If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', it swaps these characters and increments the cost by the length of the substring being shifted (`right - left + 1`).
     - **Move Right Pointer**: The right pointer is moved to the next '0' in the list.
     - **Move Left Pointer**: The left pointer is moved to the next '1' in the list.
   - **Return**: The function returns the total cost of the swaps.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The program aims to sort the binary string by moving all '1's to the right and all '0's to the left.
   - The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.
   - The program correctly identifies the positions of '1's and '0's and performs the necessary swaps to sort the string.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted. In such cases, the cost should be 0, but the program might still perform unnecessary checks and potentially swaps.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Already Sorted String**: If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the program should return 0 without any swaps. The current implementation might still enter the loop and perform unnecessary checks, but it will not increment the cost.
   - **Single '1' or '0'**: If the string contains only one type of character (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the program should return 0. The current implementation handles this correctly.

5. **Optimization**:
   - The program can be optimized to avoid unnecessary checks by breaking the loop early if the string is already sorted. However, this is not strictly necessary for correctness, as the current implementation will still return the correct cost.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies and performs the necessary swaps to sort the binary string.
   - The cost calculation is correct for each swap.
   - The program handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct in terms of solving the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
