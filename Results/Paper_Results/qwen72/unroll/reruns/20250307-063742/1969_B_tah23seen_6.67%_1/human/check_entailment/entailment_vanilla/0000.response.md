Let's analyze the given Python program to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description. The program is supposed to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and calls the function `func_1` to compute the minimum cost.
   - The result of `func_1` is printed for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a binary string `sChar` as input.
   - It converts the string `sChar` into a list `s` to facilitate character swapping.
   - It initializes `left` to 0, `cost` to 0, and `right` to 1.
   - The program then enters a loop to find and swap '1's and '0's to sort the string.

3. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop condition is `while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s))`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1'. If so, it swaps these characters and increments the cost by the length of the substring being shifted (`right - left + 1`).
   - After the swap, it moves `right` to the next '0' and `left` to the next '1' using nested while loops.

4. **Termination and Correctness:**
   - The loop terminates when `right` is no longer less than `len(s)` or when `left` is no longer less than `len(s)`.
   - The function returns the total cost.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Swapping Logic:**
  - The program correctly identifies the positions of '1's and '0's that need to be swapped to sort the string.
  - Each swap is performed on the smallest possible substring that contains both a '1' and a '0', which is optimal in terms of minimizing the cost.

- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost is calculated as `right - left + 1` for each swap, which is the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.
  - This cost calculation is correct based on the problem description.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If the string is already sorted, the program will not perform any swaps, and the cost will be 0.
  - The program handles strings of length 2 correctly, as shown in the example.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program uses a two-pointer approach to find and swap '1's and '0's, which is efficient for the given constraints.
  - The nested while loops ensure that the program does not perform unnecessary operations.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for sorting a binary string using cyclic shifts and calculating the minimum total cost. It handles all edge cases and efficiently processes the input.

Correctness: **True**
