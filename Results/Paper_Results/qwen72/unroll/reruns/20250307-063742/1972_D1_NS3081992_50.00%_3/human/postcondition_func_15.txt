The function `func_16` does not return any value. It calls `func_10` to determine the number of test cases, and for each test case, it calls `func_15` to get an integer representing the number of valid pairs (a, b). These integers are then printed to the standard output, each followed by a newline character. The function does not modify any external variables or state.
