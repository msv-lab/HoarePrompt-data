The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It returns the total number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions, where the number of test cases is determined by the function `func_10`, and each test case's result is determined by the function `func_15`.

Functionality: **The function returns the total number of valid pairs (a, b) across all test cases, where the number of test cases is determined by `func_10` and each test case's result is determined by `func_15`.**
