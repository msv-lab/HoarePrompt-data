The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, and three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `a` and, for each element that is less than `m`, it reduces `k` by the difference `(m - a[i])`. After the iteration, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The values of `n`, `m`, and the list `a` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.
