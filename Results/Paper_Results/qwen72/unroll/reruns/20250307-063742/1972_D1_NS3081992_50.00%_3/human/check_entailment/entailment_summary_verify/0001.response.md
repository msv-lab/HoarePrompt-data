### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the logic in `func_15` is not aligned with the problem's requirements. Let's break down the reasoning in more detail:

1. **Problem Requirements:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be simplified to \(a \equiv -b \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

2. **Function `func_15` Analysis:**
   - The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7`.
   - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It enters a loop where `i` is incremented until \(i^2\) exceeds \(n + i\).
   - Inside the loop, it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

   **Issues with `func_15`:**
   - The loop condition `while i * i <= n + i` is not related to the problem's conditions. It appears to be an arbitrary condition that does not help in counting valid pairs.
   - The calculation \((n + i) // (i * i)\) inside the loop is also not related to the problem's conditions. It does not check the required condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).
   - The function does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

3. **Function `func_16` Analysis:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases \(t\) using `func_10`.
   - It iterates over the test cases and for each test case, it calls `func_15` and writes the result to standard output.
   - This function is correct in terms of handling the input and output for multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The loop and the calculation inside the loop are not aligned with the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
