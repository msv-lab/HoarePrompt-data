Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, `func_15` is performing a different calculation that does not align with these conditions. Specifically, it is summing up integer divisions of \(n + i\) by \(i \cdot i\) for \(i\) from 1 to the largest integer such that \(i \cdot i \le n + i\), which is not related to the problem's requirements.

To further validate this, let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the correct pairs are \((1,1)\), \((2,1)\), and \((2,2)\). The function `func_15` does not handle this correctly and will produce an incorrect result.

The annotated code confirms that `func_15` is not performing the necessary checks to ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
