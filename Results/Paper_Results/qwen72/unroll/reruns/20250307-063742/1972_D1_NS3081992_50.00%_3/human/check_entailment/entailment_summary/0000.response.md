### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the standard input.
   - `func_15()` reads the values of `n` and `m` for each test case using `func_7()`, which correctly reads two space-separated integers from the input.

2. **Problem Logic:**
   - The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
     - `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`
     - `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`
   - `func_15()` attempts to solve this problem by iterating over `i` and calculating the sum of integer divisions. However, the logic in `func_15()` does not directly address the problem's requirements. The loop and the condition `i * i <= n + i` do not seem to be related to the problem of finding pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Function `func_15` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_15()` calculates a sum based on a loop that iterates over `i` and performs integer division. This does not match the problem's requirement to count valid pairs `(a, b)`.
   - The function `func_15()` does not use `m` in its calculations, which is a critical part of the problem's constraints.
   - The logic in `func_15()` is not aligned with the problem's requirement to check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

4. **Function `func_16` Analysis:**
   - `func_16()` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_10()` to get the number of test cases and then calling `func_15()` for each test case.
   - However, since `func_15()` does not correctly solve the problem, the output of `func_16()` will also be incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_15()` does not implement the logic required to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Correctness: **False**
