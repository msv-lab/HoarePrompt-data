Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The function `func_15` is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the implementation of `func_15` does not follow this logic. Instead, it seems to be calculating a different value, and the logic inside the function does not match the problem requirements.

For example, consider the input (n=2, m=3). The correct output should be 3, as the pairs (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2) satisfy the conditions. However, the function `func_15` does not handle this correctly and will produce an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
