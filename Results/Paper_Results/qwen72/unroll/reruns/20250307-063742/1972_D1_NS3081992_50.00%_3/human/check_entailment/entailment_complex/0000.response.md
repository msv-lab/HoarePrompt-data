### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the standard input.
   - `func_16()` iterates `t` times, reading the values of `n` and `m` for each test case using `func_15()`, and then prints the result of `func_15()` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_15()`:**
   - This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - However, the implementation of `func_15()` does not correctly solve the problem. It calculates a sum based on a loop that iterates over `i` such that `i * i <= n + i`, which is not related to the problem statement. The function returns `ans - 1`, but this does not correspond to the number of valid pairs.

3. **Function `func_13()`:**
   - This function is a standard implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`, along with the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `a * x + b * y = gcd(a, b)`.
   - While this function is correct, it is not used in the solution to the problem.

4. **Other Functions:**
   - Functions `func_1` to `func_12` are not used in the main logic of the program. They are not relevant to the problem of counting valid pairs `(a, b)`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because `func_15()` does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_15()` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`, but it instead performs an unrelated calculation and returns an incorrect result.

### Correctness: **False**
