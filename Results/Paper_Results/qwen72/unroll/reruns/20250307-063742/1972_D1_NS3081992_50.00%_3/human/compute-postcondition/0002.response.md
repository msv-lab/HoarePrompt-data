Output State: The function `func_10` is called and returns a non-negative integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `func_15` is called and returns an integer representing the number of valid pairs (a, b). These integers are written to `sys.stdout`, each followed by a newline character. After all iterations of the loop, the output state is that the specified number of integers (one for each test case) have been printed to the standard output, each on a new line. The initial state of the variables outside the loop remains unchanged.
