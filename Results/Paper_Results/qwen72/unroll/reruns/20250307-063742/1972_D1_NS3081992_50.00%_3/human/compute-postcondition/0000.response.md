To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the result of `func_10()`. The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than 0. Since no variables are passed to `func_16`, and the loop head only involves the result of `func_10()`, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a value that allows the loop to run at least once.

State: **`func_10()` must return a non-negative integer greater than 0**
