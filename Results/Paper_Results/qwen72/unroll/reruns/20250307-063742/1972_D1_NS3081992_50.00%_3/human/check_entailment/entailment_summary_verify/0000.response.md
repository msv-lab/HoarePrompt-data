### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_15`**:
   - The function `func_15` is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the implementation of `func_15` does not follow this logic. Instead, it performs a loop that increments `i` and calculates \((n + i) // (i * i)\), which is not related to the problem's requirements.
   - The logic inside `func_15` is fundamentally different from what is needed to solve the problem.

2. **Function `func_16`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases using `func_10` and then calls `func_15` for each test case.
   - The output of `func_15` is printed for each test case.
   - Since `func_15` is incorrect, the output of `func_16` will also be incorrect.

3. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input \((n=2, m=3)\), the correct pairs are \((1,1)\), \((2,1)\), and \((2,2)\), which gives a total of 3 valid pairs.
   - The function `func_15` does not correctly handle this input and will produce an incorrect result.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program is incorrect because the core function `func_15` does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment correctly identified this issue.

Final: **False**
