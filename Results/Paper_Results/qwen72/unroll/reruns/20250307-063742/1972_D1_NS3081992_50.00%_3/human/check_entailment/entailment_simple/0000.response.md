Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the program does not correctly implement the solution for this problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function 15**:
   - The function `func_15` is intended to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The logic inside `func_15` is incorrect. It uses a loop that increments `i` and calculates `ans` based on the condition `i * i <= n + i`, which does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The correct approach should involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

2. **Function 16**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases using `func_10` and then calls `func_15` for each test case.
   - The issue here is that `func_15` is not correctly solving the problem, so even though the structure of reading test cases and printing results is correct, the results themselves are incorrect.

3. **Other Functions**:
   - Functions like `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_9`, and `func_10` are used for input handling and are generally correct for their intended purposes.
   - Functions `func_12` and `func_13` are not used in the main logic and seem to be unrelated to the problem at hand.
   - Function `func_14` is also not used and does not seem to be relevant to the problem.

Given the incorrect logic in `func_15`, the program as a whole does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
