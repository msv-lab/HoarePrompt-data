### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The functions `func_10` and `func_7` are used to read the number of test cases and the values of \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case, respectively. These functions are correct for reading input.

2. **Logic in `func_15`:**
   - The function `func_15` is intended to solve the problem of counting valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. However, the logic implemented in `func_15` is incorrect.
   - The loop condition `while i * i <= n + i` and the calculation \((n + i) // (i * i)\) do not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current implementation does not perform this check.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The function `func_16` correctly writes the results to standard output for each test case. However, since `func_15` is incorrect, the results written to the output will also be incorrect.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_15`:
- **Correct Logic:**
  - For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
  - This can be simplified to checking if \(a \equiv -b \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).
  - A correct implementation would involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and checking the condition for each pair.

- **Incorrect Logic:**
  - The current implementation of `func_15` uses a loop with a condition `while i * i <= n + i`, which is not related to the problem's conditions.
  - The calculation \((n + i) // (i * i)\) is also not related to the problem's conditions.
  - The function returns `ans - 1`, which is not the correct result for the problem.

### Correct Implementation:
A correct implementation of `func_15` would look something like this:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                ans += 1
    return ans
```

This implementation correctly iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because `func_15` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

Final: **False**
