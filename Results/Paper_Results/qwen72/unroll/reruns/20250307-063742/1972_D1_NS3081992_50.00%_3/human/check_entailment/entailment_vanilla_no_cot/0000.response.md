Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_15` attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs, but it does not consider the conditions specified in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Instead, it performs a calculation that does not align with the problem's requirements. Additionally, the program includes several functions that are not used in the solution, which can be considered extraneous and do not contribute to the correctness of the program.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the values of `n` and `m`.
3. Calculate the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
4. Print the result for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math
import sys

def gcd(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        result = count_valid_pairs(n, m)
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for each test case. It uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible pairs and checks the condition using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
