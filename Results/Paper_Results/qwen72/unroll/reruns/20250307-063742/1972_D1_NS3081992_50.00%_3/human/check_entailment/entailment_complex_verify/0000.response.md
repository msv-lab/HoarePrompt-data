Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_15` does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The function is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the implementation of `func_15` is entirely unrelated to this logic. It calculates a sum of integer divisions, which does not correspond to the problem's requirements. 

For example, the function `func_15` calculates the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= n + i - 1`, and then returns this sum minus one. This is not the same as counting the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

The function `func_16` correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases, but since `func_15` is incorrect, the overall program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
