You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Key Observations:
- For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), we need to check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).
- This can be simplified to \(a \equiv -b \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of several functions, but the main logic is in `func_15` and `func_16`.

#### Function 15:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

- This function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7`.
- It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
- It enters a loop where `i` is incremented until \(i^2\) exceeds \(n + i\).
- Inside the loop, it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.
- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

#### Function 16:
```python
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
```

- This function reads the number of test cases \(t\) using `func_10`.
- It iterates over the test cases and for each test case, it calls `func_15` and writes the result to standard output.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_10` reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - `func_7` reads the integers \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case.
   - These functions are correct for reading input.

2. **Logic in `func_15`:**
   - The loop condition `while i * i <= n + i` is not directly related to the problem's conditions.
   - The calculation \((n + i) // (i * i)\) is also not directly related to the problem's conditions.
   - The function `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - `func_16` correctly writes the results to standard output for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The logic in `func_15` is incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The loop and the calculation inside the loop do not align with the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
