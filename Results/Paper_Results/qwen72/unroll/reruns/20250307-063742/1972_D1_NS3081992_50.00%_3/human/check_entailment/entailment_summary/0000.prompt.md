Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    func_16()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads an integer from the standard input and returns it. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the program has read one line from the standard input and converted it to an integer, which is then returned.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin), expects the line to contain two space-separated integers, and returns a map object containing the two integers. The function does not modify any external variables or state.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and returns them as a list of integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` and returns a list containing `rows_number` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_3()`. If `rows_number` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace from this line, and returns the result.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, decodes it from bytes to a string, and returns the resulting string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` reads a line of input from the user, which is expected to contain space-separated integers, and returns a list of integers derived from this input. The function does not modify any external variables or state; it only processes the input and returns the resulting list.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a non-negative integer `rows` and returns a list of length `rows`, where each element is the result of calling `func_7()`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a list with `rows` elements, each of which is the output of `func_7()`.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` reads a line of input from the standard input (e.g., user input via the console) and returns it as a string. After the function concludes, the program state is such that the input provided by the user is returned, and no other variables or state changes are affected by this function.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value provided by the user input. After the function concludes, the program has obtained an integer from the user, and this integer is the final state of the function's execution.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user and returns a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by whitespace. The function does not modify any external variables or state.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer key `da` from `d`, and a list `rank`. It returns 1 if the list associated with the key `da` in `d` has exactly one element. Otherwise, it updates the `processing` list by setting elements at indices `di - 1` (where `di` is in the list `d[da]` and `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0) to 1, and then resets them to 0 after processing. The function also updates the `rank` list by setting `rank[da - 1]` to the minimum value of recursive calls to `func_12` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0, incremented by 1. Finally, it returns this updated value of `tmp + 1`.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges (1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers provided in the problem description). It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` where `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are integers such that `a * x + b * y = g`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the values of `x` and `y` based on the results of `func_13(b, a % b)`.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, and three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `a` and, for each element that is less than `m`, it reduces `k` by the difference `(m - a[i])`. After the iteration, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The values of `n`, `m`, and the list `a` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` accepts no parameters and returns an integer. It calculates the sum of the integer divisions of `n + i` by `i * i` for all `i` from 1 to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= n + i - 1`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers obtained from `func_7` and satisfy `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`. The function then returns this sum minus one.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` does not return any value. It calls `func_10` to determine the number of test cases, and for each test case, it calls `func_15` to get an integer representing the number of valid pairs (a, b). These integers are then printed to the standard output, each followed by a newline character. The function does not modify any external variables or state.
