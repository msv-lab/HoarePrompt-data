### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The functions `func_10` and `func_7` are used to read the number of test cases \(t\) and the integers \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case, respectively. These functions are correct for reading input.

2. **Logic in `func_15`:**
   - The function `func_15` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the loop condition `while i * i <= n + i` and the calculation \((n + i) // (i * i)\) inside the loop do not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The loop condition is based on \(i^2\) and \(n + i\), which are not related to the conditions \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).
   - The calculation \((n + i) // (i * i)\) is also not related to the problem's conditions. It does not count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as required.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The function `func_16` correctly writes the results to standard output for each test case. However, since the results from `func_15` are incorrect, the output will also be incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The logic in `func_15` is indeed incorrect and does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
