The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It calculates a value `ans` which is the sum of the integer divisions of `n + i` by `i * i` for all `i` from 1 to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= n + i - 1`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers with the constraint 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function then returns `ans - 1`.

Functionality: **The function calculates the sum of the integer divisions of `n + i` by `i * i` for all `i` from 1 to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= n + i - 1`, and returns this sum minus one.**
