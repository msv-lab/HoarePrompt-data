You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #State: The dictionary `d` and the list `rank` remain unchanged. The list `processing` will have some elements set to 1, specifically those elements at indices `di - 1` where `di` is in the list `d[da]` and `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. The variable `tmp` will be the minimum value of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer key `da` from `d`, and a list `rank`. It returns 1 if the list associated with the key `da` in `d` has exactly one element. Otherwise, it updates the `processing` list by setting elements at indices `di - 1` (where `di` is in the list `d[da]` and `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0) to 1, and then resets them to 0 after processing. The function also updates the `rank` list by setting `rank[da - 1]` to the minimum value of recursive calls to `func_12` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0, incremented by 1. Finally, it returns this updated value of `tmp + 1`.

#Function 13:

    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)`, where `y` is the second value returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`, `x - a // b * y` is a calculated value based on the first value `x` returned by `func_13(b, a % b)` and the integer division of `a` by `b`, and `g` is the third value returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges (1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers provided in the problem description). It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` where `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are integers such that `a * x + b * y = g`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the values of `x` and `y` based on the results of `func_13(b, a % b)`.

#Function 14:

        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: k is reduced by the sum of differences (m - a[i]) for all elements a[i] in the list a that are less than m, while the values of n, m, and the list a remain unchanged. Additionally, k is less than 0.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, and three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `a` and, for each element that is less than `m`, it reduces `k` by the difference `(m - a[i])`. After the iteration, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The values of `n`, `m`, and the list `a` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n + i - 1`, and `ans` is the sum of the integer divisions of `n + i` by `i * i` for all `i` from 1 to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= n + i - 1`.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of the integer divisions of `n + i` by `i * i` for all `i` from 1 to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= n + i - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts no parameters and returns an integer. It calculates the sum of the integer divisions of `n + i` by `i * i` for all `i` from 1 to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= n + i - 1`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers obtained from `func_7` and satisfy `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`. The function then returns this sum minus one.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function func_16. The function func_10 returns a non-negative integer representing the number of test cases, and func_15 returns an integer for each test case, which is the number of valid pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: Output State: The function `func_10` is called and returns a non-negative integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `func_15` is called and returns an integer representing the number of valid pairs (a, b). These integers are written to `sys.stdout`, each followed by a newline character. After all iterations of the loop, the output state is that the specified number of integers (one for each test case) have been printed to the standard output, each on a new line. The initial state of the variables outside the loop remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not return any value. It calls `func_10` to determine the number of test cases, and for each test case, it calls `func_15` to get an integer representing the number of valid pairs (a, b). These integers are then printed to the standard output, each followed by a newline character. The function does not modify any external variables or state.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The function `func_15` is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the implementation of `func_15` does not follow this logic. Instead, it seems to be calculating a different value, and the logic inside the function does not match the problem requirements.

For example, consider the input (n=2, m=3). The correct output should be 3, as the pairs (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2) satisfy the conditions. However, the function `func_15` does not handle this correctly and will produce an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
