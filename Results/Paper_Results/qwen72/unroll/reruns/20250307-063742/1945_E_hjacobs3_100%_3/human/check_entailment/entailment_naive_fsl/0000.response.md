Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the binary search will always find the correct index after at most 2 swaps. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
4 5 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1 3
4 5
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
1 4
```

In this case, the permutation is `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]` and we need to find the number `3`. The program attempts to swap the elements at positions `1` and `4`, resulting in the permutation `[3, 5, 1, 2, 4]`. However, this permutation is still not in a form where binary search can correctly find the number `3`.

The correct approach would involve ensuring that the permutation is transformed into a form where binary search can work correctly. This might involve more complex logic to determine the necessary swaps to make the permutation partially sorted or to handle the specific conditions of the problem. The provided program does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
