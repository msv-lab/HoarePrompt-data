You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(' '.join(res))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if l != array.index(find):
        print(1)
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
    else:
        print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `find`. It returns a list of two strings: the first string is the string representation of `l + 1`, where `l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`; the second string is the string representation of the index of `find` in `array` plus 1. If `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`, it prints `1`; otherwise, it prints `0`. The function modifies the values of `l` and `r` during its execution, but these changes are not reflected outside the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
- We can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation before applying binary search.
- The binary search algorithm is used to find the position `l` such that `p_l` is equal to `x`.
- The goal is to output the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and then the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes the permutation `array` and the number `find` as inputs.
   - It initializes `l` and `r` to 0 and `n` respectively.
   - It performs a binary search loop:
     - If `r - l > 1`, it calculates the middle index `mid`.
     - If `array[mid] <= find`, it updates `l` to `mid`.
     - Otherwise, it updates `r` to `mid`.
   - After the loop, it checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array.
     - If `l` is not the correct index, it prints 1 and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.
     - If `l` is the correct index, it prints 0.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The main loop calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - If `func_1` returns a result, it prints the result.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Binary Search Initialization:**
   - The binary search initialization is slightly incorrect. The variable `r` should be initialized to `n` (not `n + 1`), and `l` should be initialized to `1` (not `0`), to match the problem's description of indices starting from 1.

2. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - The loop condition `r - l > 1` is correct.
   - The calculation of `mid` is correct.
   - The update of `l` and `r` is correct.

3. **Index Check and Swap:**
   - The check `if l != array.index(find)` is incorrect because `l` is a 0-based index, while the problem description uses 1-based indices.
   - The function should return the 1-based indices for the swap.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The function `func_1` prints the number of swaps directly, which is not the correct approach. It should return the number of swaps and the indices, and the main loop should handle the printing.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    (k, res) = func_1(array, x)
    print(k)
    if k > 0:
        for swap in res:
            print(' '.join(map(str, swap)))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (1, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid - 1] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if array[l - 1] != find:
        # Find the correct index of find
        correct_index = array.index(find) + 1
        return (1, [(l, correct_index)])
    else:
        return (0, [])
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization:** `l` is set to 1 and `r` is set to `n` to match 1-based indexing.
- **Binary Search Loop:** The loop remains the same, but `mid` is adjusted to be 1-based by subtracting 1 when accessing `array[mid - 1]`.
- **Index Check:** The check is now `array[l - 1] != find` to use 1-based indexing.
- **Swap Output:** The function returns the number of swaps and the list of swaps, which is then printed in the main loop.

### Conclusion:
The original program has issues with indexing and output format. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly according to the problem description.
