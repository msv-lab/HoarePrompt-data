The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array` and `find`. `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) where all elements are distinct and in the range [1, n]. `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation.

The function returns a list containing two string elements:
1. The first element is the string representation of `l + 1`, where `l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`.
2. The second element is the string representation of the index of `find` in the `array` plus 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `find`. It returns a list of two strings: the first string is the largest index plus one where the element in `array` is less than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the index of `find` in `array` plus one.**
