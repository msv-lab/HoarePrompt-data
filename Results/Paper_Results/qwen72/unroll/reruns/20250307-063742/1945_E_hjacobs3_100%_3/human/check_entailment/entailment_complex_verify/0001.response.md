Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified several issues with the given program. Let's break down the reasoning and validate it against the annotated code and problem description:

1. **Binary Search Initialization:**
   - The original program initializes `l` and `r` to 0 and `n` respectively. However, the problem description specifies that indices are 1-based. Therefore, `l` should be initialized to 1 and `r` to `n + 1` to correctly handle the 1-based indexing.
   - The annotated code confirms that `l` and `r` are 0-based, which is inconsistent with the problem's requirement.

2. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - The loop condition `r - l > 1` is correct.
   - The calculation of `mid` is correct.
   - The update of `l` and `r` is correct, but the access to `array[mid]` should be `array[mid - 1]` to match 1-based indexing.

3. **Index Check and Swap:**
   - The check `if l != array.index(find)` is incorrect because `l` is a 0-based index, while the problem description uses 1-based indices.
   - The function should return the 1-based indices for the swap, not 0-based indices.
   - The annotated code confirms that the function returns 0-based indices, which is incorrect.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The function `func_1` prints the number of swaps directly, which is not the correct approach. It should return the number of swaps and the indices, and the main loop should handle the printing.
   - The annotated code confirms that the function prints the number of swaps directly, which is inconsistent with the problem's requirement.

### Corrected Program:
The corrected program provided in the original assessment addresses these issues:
```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    (k, res) = func_1(array, x)
    print(k)
    if k > 0:
        for swap in res:
            print(' '.join(map(str, swap)))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (1, n + 1)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid - 1] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if array[l - 1] != find:
        # Find the correct index of find
        correct_index = array.index(find) + 1
        return (1, [(l, correct_index)])
    else:
        return (0, [])
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization:** `l` is set to 1 and `r` is set to `n + 1` to match 1-based indexing.
- **Binary Search Loop:** The loop remains the same, but `mid` is adjusted to be 1-based by subtracting 1 when accessing `array[mid - 1]`.
- **Index Check:** The check is now `array[l - 1] != find` to use 1-based indexing.
- **Swap Output:** The function returns the number of swaps and the list of swaps, which is then printed in the main loop.

### Conclusion:
The original program has significant issues with indexing and output format, which are correctly identified and addressed in the original assessment. The corrected program should work correctly according to the problem description.

Final: **False**
