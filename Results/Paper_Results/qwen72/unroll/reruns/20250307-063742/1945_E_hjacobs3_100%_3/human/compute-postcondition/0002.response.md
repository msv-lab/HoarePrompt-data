The only variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `r - l > 1`. Right before the loop, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n`. For the loop to execute, `r - l` must be greater than 1. Given that `l` is 0, `r` (which is `n`) must be greater than 1.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where all elements are distinct and in the range [1, `n`], `find` is an integer in the range [1, `n`], `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 1**
