### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues and the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Binary Search Assumption**:
   - The binary search algorithm assumes that the array is sorted. However, the permutation given is not sorted, and the program does not sort it or ensure that it is in a form where binary search can work correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` performs a binary search on the given permutation. However, it does not perform any swaps to rearrange the permutation before the search.
   - The function only checks if the final index `l` is equal to the index of `find` in the array. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices to swap. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the permutation will be in a form where binary search can find the correct index after at most 2 swaps.

3. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     5 3
     4 5 1 2 3
     ```
   - The permutation is `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]` and we need to find `3`.
   - The program performs a binary search and finds that `l` is `0` (since `array[0] = 4` and `4 > 3`).
   - The program then prints `1` and returns the indices `1` and `4` (which are `0 + 1` and `array.index(3) + 1`).
   - After the swap, the permutation becomes `[3, 5, 1, 2, 4]`.
   - However, this permutation is still not in a form where binary search can correctly find the number `3`.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, the program should ensure that the permutation is transformed into a form where binary search can work. This might involve:
     - Identifying the positions of the elements that need to be swapped to make the permutation partially sorted.
     - Performing at most 2 swaps to achieve this.
   - The current program does not implement this logic and only performs a single swap based on the final index `l` of the binary search, which is insufficient.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. It fails to ensure that the permutation is in a form where binary search can find the correct index after at most 2 swaps. The provided example case clearly demonstrates this failure. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.
