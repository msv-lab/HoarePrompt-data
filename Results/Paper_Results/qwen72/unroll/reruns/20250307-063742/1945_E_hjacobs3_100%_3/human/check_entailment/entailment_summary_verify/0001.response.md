### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Initialization:**
   - The original function `func_1` initializes `l` and `r` to 0 and `n` respectively. However, the problem description specifies that indices start from 1, not 0. Therefore, `l` should be initialized to 1 and `r` to `n + 1` to correctly handle the 1-based indexing.

2. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - The loop condition `r - l > 1` is correct.
   - The calculation of `mid` is correct, but `mid` should be used as `mid - 1` when accessing the array to convert it to 0-based indexing.
   - The update of `l` and `r` is correct.

3. **Index Check and Swap:**
   - The check `if l != array.index(find)` is incorrect because `l` is a 0-based index, while the problem description uses 1-based indices. The correct check should be `array[l - 1] != find`.
   - The function should return the number of swaps and the indices, not print them directly. The main loop should handle the printing.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The function `func_1` should return a tuple containing the number of swaps and a list of swap pairs. The main loop should then print the number of swaps and the swap pairs if any.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    (k, res) = func_1(array, x)
    print(k)
    for swap in res:
        print(' '.join(map(str, swap)))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (1, n + 1)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid - 1] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if array[l - 1] != find:
        # Find the correct index of find
        correct_index = array.index(find) + 1
        return (1, [(l, correct_index)])
    else:
        return (0, [])
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization:** `l` is set to 1 and `r` is set to `n + 1` to match 1-based indexing.
- **Binary Search Loop:** The loop remains the same, but `mid` is adjusted to be 1-based by subtracting 1 when accessing `array[mid - 1]`.
- **Index Check:** The check is now `array[l - 1] != find` to use 1-based indexing.
- **Swap Output:** The function returns a tuple containing the number of swaps and a list of swap pairs. The main loop prints the number of swaps and the swap pairs if any.

### Conclusion:
The original program has issues with indexing and output format. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
