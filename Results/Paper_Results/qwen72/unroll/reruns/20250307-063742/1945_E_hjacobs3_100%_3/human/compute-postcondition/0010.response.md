Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `find`. It returns a list of two strings: the first string is the string representation of `l + 1`, where `l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`; the second string is the string representation of the index of `find` in `array` plus 1. If `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`, it prints `1`; otherwise, it prints `0`. The function modifies the values of `l` and `r` during its execution, but these changes are not reflected outside the function. **
