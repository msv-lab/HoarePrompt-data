### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the number to find `x`.
   - It then reads the permutation `array` as a list of integers.

2. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to perform the binary search on the permutation.
   - The binary search initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n`.
   - The loop continues until `r - l` is greater than 1.
   - In each iteration, the middle index `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
   - If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `x`, `l` is updated to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid`.

3. **Post-Search Check:**
   - After the loop, `l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= x`, and `r` is the smallest index such that `array[r] > x`.
   - The program checks if `l` is the index of `x` in the array.
   - If `l` is not the index of `x`, it prints 1 and returns a list of two indices to swap: `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1`.
   - If `l` is the index of `x`, it prints 0 and returns nothing.

4. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The program assumes that if `l` is not the index of `x`, swapping `array[l]` with `array[array.index(find)]` will place `x` at the correct position for the binary search to find it.
   - This is a valid assumption because the binary search will always find the correct position if the permutation is sorted, and the swap ensures that `x` is in the correct position.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position by printing 0.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position by performing a single swap to correct it.

6. **Constraints:**
   - The program ensures that the number of operations does not exceed 2, which is within the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation and performs the necessary swap to ensure that the binary search will find `x`. The logic is sound and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
