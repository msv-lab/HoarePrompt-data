Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
- We can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation before applying binary search.
- The binary search algorithm is used to find the position `l` such that `p_l` is equal to `x`.
- The goal is to output the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and then the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes the permutation `array` and the number `find` as inputs.
   - It initializes `l` and `r` to 0 and `n` respectively.
   - It performs a binary search loop:
     - If `r - l > 1`, it calculates the middle index `mid`.
     - If `array[mid] <= find`, it updates `l` to `mid`.
     - Otherwise, it updates `r` to `mid`.
   - After the loop, it checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array.
     - If `l` is not the correct index, it prints 1 and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.
     - If `l` is the correct index, it prints 0.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The main loop calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - If `func_1` returns a result, it prints the result.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Binary Search Initialization:**
   - The binary search initialization is slightly incorrect. The variable `r` should be initialized to `n` (not `n + 1`), and `l` should be initialized to `1` (not `0`), to match the problem's description of indices starting from 1.

2. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - The loop condition `r - l > 1` is correct.
   - The calculation of `mid` is correct.
   - The update of `l` and `r` is correct.

3. **Index Check and Swap:**
   - The check `if l != array.index(find)` is incorrect because `l` is a 0-based index, while the problem description uses 1-based indices.
   - The function should return the 1-based indices for the swap.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The function `func_1` prints the number of swaps directly, which is not the correct approach. It should return the number of swaps and the indices, and the main loop should handle the printing.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    (k, res) = func_1(array, x)
    print(k)
    if k > 0:
        for swap in res:
            print(' '.join(map(str, swap)))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (1, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid - 1] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if array[l - 1] != find:
        # Find the correct index of find
        correct_index = array.index(find) + 1
        return (1, [(l, correct_index)])
    else:
        return (0, [])
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization:** `l` is set to 1 and `r` is set to `n` to match 1-based indexing.
- **Binary Search Loop:** The loop remains the same, but `mid` is adjusted to be 1-based by subtracting 1 when accessing `array[mid - 1]`.
- **Index Check:** The check is now `array[l - 1] != find` to use 1-based indexing.
- **Swap Output:** The function returns the number of swaps and the list of swaps, which is then printed in the main loop.

### Conclusion:
The original program has issues with indexing and output format. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
