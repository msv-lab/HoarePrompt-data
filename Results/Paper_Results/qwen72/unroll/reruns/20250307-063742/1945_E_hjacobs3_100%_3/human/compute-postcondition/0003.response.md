Output State: **`l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`, and `r` is the smallest index such that `array[r] > find`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop is a binary search algorithm that narrows down the range `[l, r)` to find the position where `find` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `array`.
- Initially, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n`, meaning the entire list is being considered.
- In each iteration, `mid` is calculated as the midpoint of the current range `[l, r)`.
- If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, it means `find` should be placed at or after `mid`, so `l` is updated to `mid`.
- If `array[mid]` is greater than `find`, it means `find` should be placed before `mid`, so `r` is updated to `mid`.
- The loop continues until `r - l` is 1, meaning `l` and `r` are adjacent.
- At the end of the loop, `l` will be the largest index where `array[l]` is less than or equal to `find`, and `r` will be the smallest index where `array[r]` is greater than `find`.
