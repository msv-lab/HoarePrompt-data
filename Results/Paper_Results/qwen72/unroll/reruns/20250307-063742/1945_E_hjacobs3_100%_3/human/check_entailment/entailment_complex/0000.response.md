Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_1` is almost correct. However, the indices `l` and `r` are initialized to `0` and `n`, respectively, which is typical for a 0-based index array. This is consistent with Python's indexing.

3. **Mid Calculation**: The mid-point `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`, which is the correct way to find the middle index in a binary search.

4. **Condition Check**: The condition `if array[mid] <= find` is used to update `l` or `r`. This is correct for a binary search in a sorted array. However, since the array is a permutation and not necessarily sorted, the binary search might not find the correct position of `x`.

5. **Final Check**: After the binary search loop, the program checks if `l` is the index of `x` in the array. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices to swap `l` and the actual index of `x`. If `l` is the correct index, it prints `0`.

6. **Output Format**: The output format is correct. It prints the number of operations and the indices to swap, if any.

However, there is a critical issue with the logic:

- **Binary Search on Unsorted Array**: The binary search algorithm assumes the array is sorted. Since the array is a permutation and not necessarily sorted, the binary search might not find the correct position of `x`. The binary search will only work correctly if the array is sorted or if the elements are in a specific order that allows the binary search to find `x` at the correct position.

- **Swapping Logic**: The program only swaps once if `l` is not the index of `x`. However, the problem statement allows up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly. The program does not handle the case where two swaps might be necessary.

Given the above points, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all permutations, especially those that require more than one swap to make the binary search find `x`.

Correctness: **False**
