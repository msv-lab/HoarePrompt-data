Reasoning:  
The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure it meets the problem's requirements:

1. **Binary Search Initialization**: The binary search initialization in the program is incorrect. The problem specifies that `l` should be initialized to 1 and `r` to `n + 1`. However, the program initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n`. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect results, especially when `x` is the smallest or largest element in the permutation.

2. **Output Format**: The program does not correctly output the number of operations performed. According to the problem, the number of operations should be printed on the first line of each test case, followed by the operations themselves. The program prints the number of operations inside the function, which is not the correct place.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The program does not implement the logic to perform the swaps before running the binary search. The problem requires that you can perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position. The program does not include any logic to determine or execute these swaps.

4. **Binary Search Termination**: The binary search loop should terminate when `r - l == 1`, but the program does not handle the case where `x` is not found correctly. It returns the indices for a swap if `l` is not equal to the index of `x`, but it does not ensure that the binary search will find `x` after the swap.

5. **Indexing**: The program uses 0-based indexing for the binary search, but the problem description suggests 1-based indexing. This can cause issues when printing the indices for the swaps.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
