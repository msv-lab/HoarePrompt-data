Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where all elements are distinct and in the range [1, `n`], `find` is an integer in the range [1, `n`], `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variables `l` and `r` are now initialized to 0 and `n` respectively.
