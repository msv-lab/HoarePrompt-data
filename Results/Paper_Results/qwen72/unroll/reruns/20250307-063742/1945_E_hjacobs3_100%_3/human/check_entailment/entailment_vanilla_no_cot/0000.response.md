Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic is implemented incorrectly. The indices `l` and `r` should be initialized to `0` and `n` respectively, but the program initializes `r` to `n + 1`. This can cause the binary search to go out of bounds.

2. **Output Format**: The output format is not correct. The program should output the number of operations `k` on the first line, followed by `k` lines each containing the indices `i` and `j` for the swaps. However, the program prints the number of operations within the function `func_1`, which is not the correct place for this output.

3. **Function Return Value**: The function `func_1` should return a list of strings representing the operations, but it prints the number of operations and returns a list of strings only if a swap is needed. If no swap is needed, it prints `0` but returns `None`, which will cause an error when trying to join `None` with a space in the main loop.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. The `print` statements inside `func_1` will print the number of operations for each test case, but the main loop expects the function to return a list of strings to be printed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if l != array.index(find):
        return [1, str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
    else:
        return [0]

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    print(res[0])
    if res[0] == 1:
        print(' '.join(res[1:]))
    t -= 1
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- The binary search logic is correct.
- The output format is correct.
- The function returns the appropriate values for the number of operations and the indices of the swaps.
- The main loop correctly handles the output for multiple test cases.
