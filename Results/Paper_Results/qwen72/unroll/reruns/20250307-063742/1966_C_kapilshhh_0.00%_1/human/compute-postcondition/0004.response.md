Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function processes each test case to determine if a certain condition is met (related to the distribution of stones in the piles) and prints 'Alice' for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `tc` being 0, and the original input lists remain unchanged. **
