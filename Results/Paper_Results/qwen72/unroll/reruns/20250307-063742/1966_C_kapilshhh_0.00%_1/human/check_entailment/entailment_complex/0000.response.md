### Reasoning:

The function `func` is intended to solve the problem of determining the winner of the game between Alice and Bob based on the given rules. Let's break down the logic and see if it correctly implements the solution:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of stone counts `arr`.

2. **Processing the Piles:**
   - The list `arr` is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then sorted in descending order. This is done to ensure that we are only considering unique pile sizes and in a way that allows us to process the largest piles first.
   - An extra `0` is appended to the end of the sorted list to handle edge cases where the last pile is being processed.

3. **Dynamic Programming State:**
   - The variable `dp` is initialized to `True`. This variable is used to keep track of whether the current player (starting with Alice) can force a win.
   - The length of the unique pile sizes list is recalculated as `n = len(arr) - 1`.

4. **Loop Through Piles:**
   - The function iterates through the sorted pile sizes.
   - For each pile size `arr[i]`, it checks if the difference between the current pile size and the next pile size (or 0 if it's the last pile) is greater than 1. If so, it toggles the `dp` state to `True` (indicating a win for the current player).
   - If the difference is not greater than 1, it toggles the `dp` state to `False` (indicating a loss for the current player).

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints 'Alice' if `dp` is `True` and 'Alice' if `dp` is `False`. This is a mistake because the output should be 'Bob' if `dp` is `False`.

### Issues:
- **Output Mistake:** The function always prints 'Alice' regardless of the value of `dp`. This is incorrect because the output should be 'Bob' if `dp` is `False`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True) + [
            0]
        
        dp = True
        
        n = len(arr) - 1
        
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            dp = arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp
        
        print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
        
        tc -= 1
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the function correctly determines the winner based on the game rules.
- **False** if the function has logical or implementation errors.

Given the output mistake, the function is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
