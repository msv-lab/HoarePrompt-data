The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tc` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `tc` must be greater than 0.

State: **`tc` is an input integer and `tc` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the list of lists representing the number of stones in each pile for each test case remains unchanged**
