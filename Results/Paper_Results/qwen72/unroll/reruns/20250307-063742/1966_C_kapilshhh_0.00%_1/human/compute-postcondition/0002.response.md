Output State: **`tc` is 0, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the list of lists representing the number of stones in each pile for each test case remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **`tc`**: The variable `tc` is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. After the loop finishes, `tc` will be 0 because the loop continues as long as `tc` is greater than 0.
- **`t`**: The variable `t` is not modified within the loop, so its value remains unchanged.
- **List of lists representing the number of stones**: This list is not modified within the loop, so it remains unchanged.

The loop processes each test case by reading the number of piles `n` and the list of stones `arr` for each test case. It then determines whether the game state is a winning state for Alice and prints the result. After processing all test cases, `tc` is 0, and the loop terminates.
