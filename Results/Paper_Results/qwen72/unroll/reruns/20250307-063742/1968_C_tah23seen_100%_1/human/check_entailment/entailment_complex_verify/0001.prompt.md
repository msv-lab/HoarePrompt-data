You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

    for i in ans:

- Annotated Code:

while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < len(arr), and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) == n - 1.

    #State: `i` is -1, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is updated to be the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, starting from the last element of `arr` and moving backwards.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, starting from the last element of `arr` and moving backwards. The first element of `ans` is the difference between 0 and the last element of `arr`, and each subsequent element is the difference between the previous element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, starting from the last element of `arr` and moving backwards. The first element of `ans` is initialized to \(10^9\), and each subsequent element is updated to be the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`. The final state of the program is that `ans` is a list of length `n` with the described differences.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
- We are given an array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \).
- We need to find an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that:
  - \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \le i \le n \).
  - \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements \( n \) and the array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for generating the array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \).
   - It initializes an array `ans` with \( n \) elements, all set to \( 10^9 \).
   - It then iterates backward from \( n-2 \) to \( 0 \) and sets each element \( ans[i] \) to \( ans[i+1] - arr[i] \).

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) for each test case.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The array `ans` is initialized with \( 10^9 \) for all elements. This ensures that \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) for all \( i \).

2. **Backward Iteration:**
   - The program iterates backward from \( n-2 \) to \( 0 \) and sets \( ans[i] \) to \( ans[i+1] - arr[i] \).
   - This step is based on the equation \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \), which can be rewritten as \( a_i = k \cdot a_{i-1} + x_i \) for some integer \( k \).
   - By setting \( ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i] \), the program ensures that \( ans[i+1] \) is greater than \( arr[i] \) and thus \( ans[i+1] \bmod ans[i] = arr[i] \).

3. **Correctness of the Backward Iteration:**
   - The key idea is that \( ans[i+1] \) is set to a value that is greater than \( arr[i] \) and \( ans[i] \) is set to \( ans[i+1] - arr[i] \).
   - This ensures that \( ans[i+1] \) is always greater than \( ans[i] \), and thus \( ans[i+1] \bmod ans[i] = arr[i] \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( n = 2 \) correctly. For \( n = 2 \), the array `arr` will have only one element \( x_2 \), and the program will set \( ans[0] = 10^9 \) and \( ans[1] = 10^9 - x_2 \).
   - The program also handles the case where \( x_i \) is close to \( 10^9 \). If \( arr[i] \) is very large, \( ans[i] \) will be a small positive number, ensuring that \( ans[i+1] \bmod ans[i] = arr[i] \).

5. **Constraints:**
   - The constraints \( 1 \le x_i \le 500 \) and \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) are respected by the program. Since \( ans[i+1] \) is initialized to \( 10^9 \), and \( arr[i] \) is at most 500, \( ans[i] \) will always be a positive integer within the range \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) that satisfies the given conditions for all valid inputs. The logic is sound, and the constraints are respected.

Correctness: **True**
