### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list `arr` of length `n-1`.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to \(10^9\).
   - It then iterates backward from the second-to-last element of `arr` to the first element.
   - For each element `arr[i]`, it updates `ans[i]` to be `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Initial Value of `ans[0]`:**
   - The first element of `ans` is initially set to \(10^9\), which is not necessarily correct.
   - The correct approach should be to set `ans[0]` to a value that ensures the conditions are met. Specifically, `ans[0]` should be greater than or equal to `arr[1]` and should satisfy the condition \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = x_2\).

2. **Backward Iteration:**
   - The backward iteration correctly updates `ans[i]` to be `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, but this assumes that `ans[i + 1]` is already correctly set.
   - The initial value of \(10^9\) for `ans[i + 1]` might not always be appropriate, especially for the first few elements.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) should result in \(x_i\). However, the current logic does not guarantee this for all elements.
   - For example, if `arr[i]` is 4 and `ans[i + 1]` is \(10^9\), then `ans[i]` will be \(10^9 - 4\), which is not necessarily a valid value for the modulo operation.

### Correct Approach:

1. **Set `ans[0]` to a value greater than `arr[1]` and ensure the modulo condition is met.**
2. **For each subsequent element, ensure that `ans[i]` is set such that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\).**

### Example Fix:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[1] + 1  # Ensure ans[0] is greater than arr[1]
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i]
    return ans
```

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the current program does not correctly satisfy the conditions for all test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
