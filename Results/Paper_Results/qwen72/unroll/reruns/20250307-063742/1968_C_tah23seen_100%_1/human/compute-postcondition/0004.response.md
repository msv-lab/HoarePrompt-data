Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, starting from the last element of `arr` and moving backwards. The first element of `ans` is the difference between 0 and the last element of `arr`, and each subsequent element is the difference between the previous element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`.**
