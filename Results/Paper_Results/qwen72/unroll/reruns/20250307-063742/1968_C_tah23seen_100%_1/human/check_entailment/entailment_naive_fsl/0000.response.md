Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the values in the array `arr` are such that the subtraction `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` results in a value less than 1, which is not allowed according to the problem description (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For example, consider the input where `arr = [1, 1000]` and `n = 3`. The program will set `ans[2] = 1000000000` and then `ans[1] = 1000000000 - 1000 = 999999000`, which is fine. However, when it tries to set `ans[0] = 999999000 - 1`, it will result in `999998999`, which is still within the allowed range but does not satisfy the condition `a_2 % a_1 = 1` because `1000000000 % 999998999` is not equal to 1. This indicates that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases.
