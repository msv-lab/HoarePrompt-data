Output State: **`i` is -1, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is updated to be the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, starting from the last element of `arr` and moving backwards.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, the variable `i` will be -1, and the list `ans` will have been modified such that each element from the last to the first is set to the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`. The final element of `ans` remains unchanged (still 1000000000), and each preceding element is calculated as `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.
