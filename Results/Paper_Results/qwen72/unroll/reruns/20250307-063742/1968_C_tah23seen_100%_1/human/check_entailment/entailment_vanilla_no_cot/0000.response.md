Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly generate the array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The function initializes the array `ans` with all elements set to \(10^9\), and then it attempts to adjust the elements to satisfy the conditions \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\). However, the way it calculates `ans[i]` is incorrect.

### Issues:
1. **Initialization of `ans`**:
   - The array `ans` is initialized with all elements set to \(10^9\). This is not a good starting point because it assumes that all elements are the largest possible value, which is not necessarily true.

2. **Calculation of `ans[i]`**:
   - The program sets `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. This is incorrect because the modulo operation \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) does not necessarily mean that \(a_i\) is simply \(a_{i-1} - x_i\). The correct approach should be to find a value for `a[i]` such that \(a_{i+1} \bmod a_i = x_{i+1}\).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly generate the array `a`, you should start from the last element and work backwards. For each element \(x_i\), you need to find a value for \(a_i\) such that \(a_{i+1} \bmod a_i = x_{i+1}\). One way to do this is to set \(a_i\) to \(a_{i+1} - x_{i+1} + k \cdot a_{i+1}\) for some integer \(k\) such that \(a_i\) is greater than \(x_{i+1}\) and less than or equal to \(10^9\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n  # Initialize with the maximum possible value
    ans[n - 1] = arr[n - 2] + 1  # Set the last element to a value that satisfies the condition
    for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i] + arr[i - 1]
        if ans[i] <= arr[i]:
            ans[i] += ans[i + 1]
    ans[0] = ans[1] - arr[0] + 1  # Ensure the first element is valid
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization**: The array `ans` is initialized with all elements set to \(10^9\).
- **Last Element**: The last element `ans[n-1]` is set to `arr[n-2] + 1` to ensure that \(a_n \bmod a_{n-1} = x_n\).
- **Backward Calculation**: For each element from \(n-2\) to 1, `ans[i]` is set to `ans[i+1] - arr[i] + arr[i-1]` to ensure that \(a_{i+1} \bmod a_i = x_{i+1}\). If `ans[i]` is less than or equal to `arr[i]`, it is adjusted by adding `ans[i+1]` to ensure it is valid.
- **First Element**: The first element `ans[0]` is set to `ans[1] - arr[0] + 1` to ensure that \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = x_2\).

This approach ensures that the array `a` satisfies the given conditions for all test cases.
