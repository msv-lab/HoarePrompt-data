Reasoning:  
The program aims to construct an array `a` from the input array `x` such that the conditions \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) are satisfied for all \( 2 \le i \le n \). The approach taken by the function `func_1` is to initialize the array `ans` with a large value \(10^9\) and then iteratively set each element `ans[i]` to be the difference between the next element `ans[i + 1]` and the corresponding element `arr[i]` from the input array. However, this approach has a fundamental flaw:

1. **Initialization of `ans[0]`**: The first element `ans[0]` is set to \(10^9\). This is a valid starting point, but it may not always lead to a correct solution because the subsequent elements depend on this initial value.

2. **Backward Iteration**: The function iterates backward from `n-2` to `0`, setting each `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. This ensures that \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i \) for the current `i`, but it does not necessarily ensure that the values remain within the valid range \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - If `arr[i]` is greater than `ans[i + 1]`, the value of `ans[i]` will be negative, which is not allowed.
   - The values of `ans` are not guaranteed to be positive integers, which is a requirement of the problem.

To ensure correctness, the program should:
- Start with a valid `a_1` value.
- Ensure that each `a_i` is a positive integer and satisfies the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \).

A correct approach would be to set `a_1` to a value that is greater than the maximum `x_i` and then construct the array `a` such that each `a_i` is a multiple of `a_{i-1}` plus `x_i`.

Given the current implementation, the program can produce negative values or values outside the valid range, making it incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
