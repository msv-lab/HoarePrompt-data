The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `n`. `arr` is a list of integers where the length of `arr` is between 1 and 500, and each element in `arr` is an integer between 1 and 500. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and the length of `arr` is exactly `n - 1`.

The function returns a list `ans` of length `n`. The elements of `ans` are calculated as follows:
- The first element of `ans` is the difference between 0 and the last element of `arr`.
- Each subsequent element of `ans` is the difference between the previous element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, moving backwards through `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`, and returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, starting from the last element of `arr` and moving backwards. The first element of `ans` is the difference between 0 and the last element of `arr`.**
