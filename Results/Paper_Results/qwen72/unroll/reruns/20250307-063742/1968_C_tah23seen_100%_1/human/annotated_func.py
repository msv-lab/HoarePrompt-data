#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < len(arr), and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) == n - 1.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: `i` is -1, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is updated to be the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, starting from the last element of `arr` and moving backwards.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, starting from the last element of `arr` and moving backwards. The first element of `ans` is the difference between 0 and the last element of `arr`, and each subsequent element is the difference between the previous element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, starting from the last element of `arr` and moving backwards. The first element of `ans` is initialized to \(10^9\), and each subsequent element is updated to be the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`. The final state of the program is that `ans` is a list of length `n` with the described differences.
