The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, starting from the last element of `arr` and moving backwards. The first element of `ans` is initialized to \(10^9\), and each subsequent element is updated to be the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`. The final state of the program is that `ans` is a list of length `n` with the described differences.
