You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < len(arr), and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) == n - 1.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: `i` is -1, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is updated to be the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, starting from the last element of `arr` and moving backwards.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, starting from the last element of `arr` and moving backwards. The first element of `ans` is the difference between 0 and the last element of `arr`, and each subsequent element is the difference between the previous element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`, and returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, starting from the last element of `arr` and moving backwards. The first element of `ans` is the difference between 0 and the last element of `arr`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`, starting from the last element of `arr` and moving backwards. The first element of `ans` is the difference between 0 and the last element of `arr`, and each subsequent element is the difference between the previous element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
