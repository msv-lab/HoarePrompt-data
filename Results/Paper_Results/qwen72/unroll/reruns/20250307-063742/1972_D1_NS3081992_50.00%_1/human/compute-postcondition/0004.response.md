Output State: **`i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n + i - 1`, and `ans` is the sum of the integer divisions of `n + i` by `i * i` for all `i` from 1 to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= n + i - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`.
- In each iteration, `ans` is incremented by the integer division of `n + i` by `i * i`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.
- The loop stops when `i * i` becomes greater than `n + i`.
- Therefore, the final value of `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n + i - 1`.
- The final value of `ans` is the sum of the integer divisions of `n + i` by `i * i` for all `i` from 1 to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= n + i - 1`.
