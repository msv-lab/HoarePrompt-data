Reasoning:

The provided program is incomplete and does not fully solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function Definitions and Usage**: The functions `func_10()` and `func_15()` are called in `func_16()`, but `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\) and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, `func_15()` is performing a different calculation that does not match the problem's requirements.

2. **Logic in `func_15()`**: The loop in `func_15()` is iterating over `i` and performing integer division, but this does not correspond to the problem's conditions. The loop should be iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

3. **Input Handling**: The input handling functions (`func_10()`, `func_7()`, etc.) are defined, but they are not used in a way that aligns with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the input should be read and processed to handle multiple test cases, and for each test case, the correct pairs should be counted.

4. **Output Handling**: The output is generated by `func_16()`, which calls `func_15()` for each test case. However, since `func_15()` is incorrect, the output will also be incorrect.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
