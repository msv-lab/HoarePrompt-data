### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, `func_15()` is called, which reads the values of `n` and `m` from the input using `func_7()`.

2. **Function `func_15`:**
   - This function is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
     - `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`
     - `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`
   - However, the implementation of `func_15` does not correctly solve the problem. It calculates a different value:
     - It initializes `ans` to 0.
     - It iterates over `i` from 1 to the largest integer such that `i * i <= n + i`.
     - For each `i`, it adds `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.
   - This logic does not match the problem description. The problem requires counting pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`, but `func_15` is performing a different calculation that is unrelated to the problem.

3. **Function `func_16`:**
   - This function prints the result of `func_15()` for each test case.
   - Since `func_15` is incorrect, the output of `func_16` will also be incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because `func_15` does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function is performing a different calculation that does not count the valid pairs `(a, b)` as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**False**
