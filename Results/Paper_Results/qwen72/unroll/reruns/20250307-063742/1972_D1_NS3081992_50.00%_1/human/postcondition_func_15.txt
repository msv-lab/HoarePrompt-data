The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It executes a loop a number of times determined by the return value of `func_10()`. During each iteration, it prints the result of `func_15()` followed by a newline character to the standard output. The function does not return any value. The state of any other variables not used in the loop remains unchanged.
