Output State: **The output state cannot be determined precisely because the functions `func_10()` and `func_15()` are not defined in the provided code snippet. However, the loop will execute `func_10()` times, and during each iteration, it will print the result of `func_15()` followed by a newline character. The state of any other variables not used in the loop head or body remains unchanged.**
