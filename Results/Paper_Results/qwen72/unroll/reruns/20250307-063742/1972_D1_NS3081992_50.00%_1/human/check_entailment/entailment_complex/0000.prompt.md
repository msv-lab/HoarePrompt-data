Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of input from the standard input buffer, which is expected to contain integers separated by spaces. It then converts these integers from their string representation to actual integer values and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not modify any external variables or state.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of strings. Each string in the list is a part of the input provided by the user, split by whitespace. The function reads input from the user and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace characters.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers, processing is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), da is an integer key in d, and rank is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()).

    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the minimum value returned by `func_12` for the elements in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was 0, plus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` where each key maps to a list of integers, a list `processing` of integers, an integer key `da` from `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. It returns 1 if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element. Otherwise, it updates the `rank` list by setting `rank[da - 1]` to the minimum value returned by recursive calls to `func_12` for elements in `d[da]` where the corresponding `processing` value is 0, plus 1. The function does not modify the dictionary `d` or the list `processing` in a persistent manner, and it leaves the integer `da` unchanged.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.
def func_13(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :

    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple (y, x - a // b * y, g), where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the values returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`. `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, and b is not equal to 0. `a // b` is the integer division of `a` by `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a` <= `n` and 1 <= `b` <= `m`). It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` where `x` and `y` are integers, and `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. If `b` is not 0, the function recursively computes the values of `x`, `y`, and `g` such that `a * x + b * y = g`.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), m is a positive integer, and k is an integer.
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
        
    #State: a remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, m remains unchanged, and k is reduced by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in range(n) where a[i] < m.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: a remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, m remains unchanged, and k is reduced by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in range(n) where a[i] < m. Additionally, k is less than 0.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`, and for each element that is less than `m`, it reduces `k` by the difference between `m` and that element. After the iteration, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the input list `a`, the integer `n`, or the integer `m`. The final state of the program is that `a`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, while `k` is reduced by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in range(n) where a[i] < m.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n + i - 1`, and `ans` is the sum of the integer divisions of `n + i` by `i * i` for all `i` from 1 to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= n + i - 1`.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of the integer divisions of `n + i` by `i * i` for all `i` from 1 to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= n + i - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts no parameters. It returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of the integer divisions of `n + i` by `i * i` for all `i` from 1 to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= n + i - 1`. The function modifies the local variables `n`, `m`, `i`, and `ans` during its execution, but these changes do not affect the program state outside the function.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, but the function relies on other functions `func_10()` and `func_15()` which are not defined in the provided code snippet.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: The output state cannot be determined precisely because the functions `func_10()` and `func_15()` are not defined in the provided code snippet. However, the loop will execute `func_10()` times, and during each iteration, it will print the result of `func_15()` followed by a newline character. The state of any other variables not used in the loop head or body remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It executes a loop a number of times determined by the return value of `func_10()`. During each iteration, it prints the result of `func_15()` followed by a newline character to the standard output. The function does not return any value. The state of any other variables not used in the loop remains unchanged.
