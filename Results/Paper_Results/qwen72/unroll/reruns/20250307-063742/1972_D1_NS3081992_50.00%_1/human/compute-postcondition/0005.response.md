Output State: **The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of the integer divisions of `n + i` by `i * i` for all `i` from 1 to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= n + i - 1`.**

In natural language: The program returns the value of `ans` minus 1. Here, `ans` is calculated by summing up the results of integer division of `n + i` by `i * i` for all values of `i` starting from 1 up to the largest integer `i` where `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i - 1`.
