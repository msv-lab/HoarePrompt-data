Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program, particularly the function `func_15`, does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, `func_15` performs a completely unrelated calculation:

1. It reads two integers `n` and `m` using `func_7`.
2. It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
3. It enters a loop where `i` is incremented until `i * i` is greater than `n + i`.
4. Inside the loop, it adds the integer division of `(n + i)` by `(i * i)` to `ans`.
5. Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

This calculation does not correspond to the problem's requirements at all. The function `func_15` is not designed to find pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_15` does not implement the required logic and provides a specific example to illustrate the discrepancy. The example with `n = 2` and `m = 3` should indeed produce 3 valid pairs, but the function `func_15` will not produce this output.

Final: **False**
