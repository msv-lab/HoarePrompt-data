Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_10()`, which correctly reads an integer from the standard input. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` using `func_7()`, which correctly reads and converts a line of space-separated integers.

2. **Main Logic**: The function `func_15()` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions. However, the logic in `func_15()` does not correctly implement the required condition that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Instead, it calculates a different value that does not match the problem description.

3. **Output**: The function `func_16()` correctly prints the result of `func_15()` for each test case, but since `func_15()` does not compute the correct value, the overall program is incorrect.

**Detailed Analysis of `func_15()`**:
- The function `func_15()` initializes `n` and `m` using `func_7()`, which is correct.
- It then enters a loop where it calculates `ans` based on the condition `i * i <= n + i`. This condition and the calculation inside the loop do not align with the problem statement, which requires checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

The correct approach to solve the problem would involve iterating over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This is not what `func_15()` does.

Correctness: **False**
