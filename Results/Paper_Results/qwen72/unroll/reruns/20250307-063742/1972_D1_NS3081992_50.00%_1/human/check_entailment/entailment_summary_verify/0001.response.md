### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_7()` to read the input for each test case, which is appropriate for the given problem where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Test Case Loop**:
   - The function `func_16()` correctly handles the test cases by reading the number of test cases using `func_10()` and then processing each test case by calling `func_15()` and writing the result to the standard output.

3. **Core Function**:
   - The core function `func_15()` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for a given `n` and `m`.
   - The function initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It then enters a loop where it increments `i` and updates `ans` based on the condition `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
   - The loop continues as long as `i * i <= n + i`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

4. **Mathematical Analysis**:
   - The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer `k`.
   - This implies:
     \[
     \frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} = k
     \]
     which means `a + b` must be divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The function `func_15()` does not correctly implement this logic. The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` and the update `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` do not reflect the problem's requirements.

5. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is not related to the problem of finding valid pairs `(a, b)`. It appears to be an arbitrary condition that does not align with the mathematical requirements of the problem.

6. **Update to `ans`**:
   - The update `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` also does not clearly correspond to the problem's requirements. It is not clear how this update helps in counting the valid pairs `(a, b)`.

7. **Output**:
   - The function `func_15()` returns `ans - 1`, which is not justified by the problem statement. The subtraction of 1 is not explained and does not seem to be necessary for the correct solution.

### Conclusion:
The core function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The loop condition and the update to `ans` do not align with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
