The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the function call `func_10()`. For the loop to execute, `func_10()` must return a value that is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, typically used when the loop variable is not needed in the loop body. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be explicitly set**
