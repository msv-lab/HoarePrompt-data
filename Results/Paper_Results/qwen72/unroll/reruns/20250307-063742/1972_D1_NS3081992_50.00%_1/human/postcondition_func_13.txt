The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`, and for each element that is less than `m`, it reduces `k` by the difference between `m` and that element. After the iteration, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the input list `a`, the integer `n`, or the integer `m`. The final state of the program is that `a`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, while `k` is reduced by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in range(n) where a[i] < m.
