You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 16 : The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It executes a loop a number of times determined by the return value of `func_10()`. During each iteration, it prints the result of `func_15()` followed by a newline character to the standard output. The function does not return any value. The state of any other variables not used in the loop remains unchanged.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program defines multiple functions for reading input in different formats. However, the function used for reading the input for this specific problem is `func_7()`, which reads a line of input and splits it into integers. This is appropriate for the given problem where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Test Case Loop**:
   - The main loop is handled by `func_16()`, which reads the number of test cases using `func_10()` and then processes each test case by calling `func_15()` and writing the result to the standard output.

3. **Core Function**:
   - The core function `func_15()` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for a given `n` and `m`.
   - The function initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It then enters a loop where it increments `i` and updates `ans` based on the condition `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
   - The loop continues as long as `i * i <= n + i`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

4. **Mathematical Analysis**:
   - The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer `k`.
   - This implies:
     \[
     \frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} = k
     \]
     which means `a + b` must be divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The function `func_15()` seems to be trying to count the number of valid pairs, but the logic inside the loop is not clear. The loop condition and the update to `ans` do not directly reflect the problem statement.

5. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is unusual and does not seem to be related to the problem of finding valid pairs `(a, b)`.
   - The update `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` also does not clearly correspond to the problem's requirements.

6. **Output**:
   - The function `func_15()` returns `ans - 1`, which is not clearly justified by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The core function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The loop condition and the update to `ans` do not align with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
