Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_15` is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the function `func_15` does not implement this logic at all. Instead, it seems to be calculating something entirely different, which is unrelated to the problem statement.

For example, consider the input `n = 2, m = 3`. The correct output should be 3, as the valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). However, the function `func_15` will not produce this result because it does not even attempt to find pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
