Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    func_16()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads an integer value from the standard input and returns this integer value.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads a line of input from the standard input buffer, which is expected to contain integers separated by spaces. It then converts these integers from their string representation to actual integer values and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not modify any external variables or state.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a list of these integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` and returns a list containing `rows_number` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_3()`. If `rows_number` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input, which is expected to be a byte string, and returns the byte string with trailing whitespace removed.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads the next line of input from the standard input (stdin), strips the trailing whitespace, decodes it from bytes to a string, and returns this string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, which is expected to be a string of space-separated integers, and returns a list of integers derived from this input. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the user's input has been processed and a list of integers is returned.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a non-negative integer `rows` and returns a list of length `rows`, where each element in the list is the result of calling `func_7()`. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters and returns the input provided by the user. After the function concludes, the program state includes the user's input as the return value.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value provided by the user. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned integer, which is the result of the user's input.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of strings. Each string in the list is a part of the input provided by the user, split by whitespace. The function reads input from the user and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace characters.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` where each key maps to a list of integers, a list `processing` of integers, an integer key `da` from `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. It returns 1 if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element. Otherwise, it updates the `rank` list by setting `rank[da - 1]` to the minimum value returned by recursive calls to `func_12` for elements in `d[da]` where the corresponding `processing` value is 0, plus 1. The function does not modify the dictionary `d` or the list `processing` in a persistent manner, and it leaves the integer `da` unchanged.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a` <= `n` and 1 <= `b` <= `m`). It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` where `x` and `y` are integers, and `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. If `b` is not 0, the function recursively computes the values of `x`, `y`, and `g` such that `a * x + b * y = g`.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`, and for each element that is less than `m`, it reduces `k` by the difference between `m` and that element. After the iteration, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the input list `a`, the integer `n`, or the integer `m`. The final state of the program is that `a`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, while `k` is reduced by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in range(n) where a[i] < m.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` accepts no parameters. It returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of the integer divisions of `n + i` by `i * i` for all `i` from 1 to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= n + i - 1`. The function modifies the local variables `n`, `m`, `i`, and `ans` during its execution, but these changes do not affect the program state outside the function.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It executes a loop a number of times determined by the return value of `func_10()`. During each iteration, it prints the result of `func_15()` followed by a newline character to the standard output. The function does not return any value. The state of any other variables not used in the loop remains unchanged.
