### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Function `func_15`**:
   - The function `func_15` is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the implementation of `func_15` does not follow this logic. Instead, it performs a loop that calculates something unrelated:
     ```python
     while i * i <= n + i:
         ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
         i += 1
     return ans - 1
     ```
   - This loop is not designed to find pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. It appears to be a different algorithm altogether, likely intended for a different problem.

2. **Function `func_16`**:
   - The function `func_16` reads the number of test cases using `func_10()` and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_15()` and printing the result.
   - Since `func_15` is incorrect, the results printed by `func_16` will also be incorrect.

3. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input \(n = 2, m = 3\), the correct output should be 3, as the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
   - However, `func_15` will not produce this result. Instead, it will calculate a value based on its own logic, which is not aligned with the problem statement.

4. **Other Functions**:
   - Functions `func_1` to `func_15` are not used in the context of solving the given problem. They are either input/output functions or unrelated to the problem.
   - The only function that is called in the main loop is `func_15`, which is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
