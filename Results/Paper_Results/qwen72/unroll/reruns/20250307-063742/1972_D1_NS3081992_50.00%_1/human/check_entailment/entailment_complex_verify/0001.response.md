### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program defines multiple functions for reading input in different formats. However, the function used for reading the input for this specific problem is `func_7()`, which reads a line of input and splits it into integers. This is appropriate for the given problem where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Test Case Loop**:
   - The main loop is handled by `func_16()`, which reads the number of test cases using `func_10()` and then processes each test case by calling `func_15()` and writing the result to the standard output. This is also appropriate for the problem.

3. **Core Function**:
   - The core function `func_15()` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for a given `n` and `m`.
   - The function initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It then enters a loop where it increments `i` and updates `ans` based on the condition `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
   - The loop continues as long as `i * i <= n + i`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

4. **Mathematical Analysis**:
   - The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer `k`.
   - This implies:
     \[
     \frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} = k
     \]
     which means `a + b` must be divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The function `func_15()` seems to be trying to count the number of valid pairs, but the logic inside the loop is not clear. The loop condition and the update to `ans` do not directly reflect the problem statement.

5. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is unusual and does not seem to be related to the problem of finding valid pairs `(a, b)`.
   - The update `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` also does not clearly correspond to the problem's requirements.

6. **Output**:
   - The function `func_15()` returns `ans - 1`, which is not clearly justified by the problem statement.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Function 15**:
  - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is not aligned with the problem's requirements. The problem requires finding pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
  - The update `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` does not reflect the logic needed to count valid pairs. It seems to be an arbitrary calculation that does not correspond to the problem's constraints.
  - The final return value `ans - 1` is also not justified by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The core function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The loop condition and the update to `ans` do not align with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
