Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the function `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic to solve this problem. It calculates a value that is unrelated to the problem's requirements. Specifically, the loop in `func_15` is trying to count something based on the condition \((n + i) // (i * i)\), which does not match the problem's condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\). However, this approach would be inefficient for large values of \(n\) and \(m\). A more efficient solution would involve mathematical insights to reduce the number of pairs that need to be checked.

Since the provided program does not correctly solve the problem, the correctness is **False**.
