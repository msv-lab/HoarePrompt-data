### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in stating that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_15`**:
   - The function `func_15` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - However, the implementation of `func_15` is:
     ```python
     def func_15():
         n, m = func_7()
         i = 1
         ans = 0
         while i * i <= n + i:
             ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
             i += 1
         return ans - 1
     ```
   - This function does not attempt to find pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Instead, it calculates a sum of integer divisions of \(n + i\) by \(i^2\) for \(i\) from 1 to the largest integer such that \(i^2 \le n + i\). This is clearly unrelated to the problem statement.

3. **Function `func_16`**:
   - The function `func_16` is the main function that processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases using `func_10()`, and for each test case, it calls `func_15()` and prints the result.
   - Since `func_15` is incorrect, `func_16` will also produce incorrect results.

4. **Example**:
   - For the input \(n = 2, m = 3\), the correct output should be 3, as the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
   - The provided `func_15` will not produce this result because it does not check the conditions specified in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Given that the function `func_15` does not implement the logic required to solve the problem, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
