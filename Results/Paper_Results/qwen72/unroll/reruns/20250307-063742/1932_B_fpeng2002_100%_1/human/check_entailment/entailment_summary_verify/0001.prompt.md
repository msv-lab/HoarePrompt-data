You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple sets of inputs from the user. For each set, it first reads an integer `n`, then reads a list of `n` integers. It computes the smallest year that is a multiple of all the integers in the list and prints this year. After processing all sets of inputs, the function ensures that `num_tests` is 0, and the last processed values of `n` and `nums` remain as they were for the final set. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. The initial state of `t` and `a` remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Description:
The problem requires us to find the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur strictly after the previous sign.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `nums`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the year in which the next sign is expected to occur.

3. **Processing Each Sign:**
   - The program iterates over each sign's periodicity in `nums`.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula:
     ```python
     start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
     ```
   - This formula ensures that the next occurrence year is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final value of `start_year`, which should be the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

### Verification of the Formula:
- The formula `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` works as follows:
  - `start_year // nums[x]` gives the number of complete cycles of `nums[x]` that fit into `start_year`.
  - Adding 1 to this quotient ensures that we move to the next cycle.
  - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the year of the next occurrence of the sign.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- Initial `start_year` = 0
- For `a_1 = 3`:
  - `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
- For `a_2 = 2`:
  - `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
- For `a_3 = 4`:
  - `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
- For `a_4 = 5`:
  - `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
- For `a_5 = 9`:
  - `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
- For `a_6 = 18`:
  - `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
- Output: `36`

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5`
- Initial `start_year` = 0

  - `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
- For `a_2 = 2`:
  - `start_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
- For `a_3 = 3`:
  - `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
- For `a_4 = 4`:
  - `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
- For `a_5 = 5`:
  - `start_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
- Output: `5`

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `5`, `1 1 1 1 1`
- Initial `start_year` = 0
- For `a_1 = 1`:
  - `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
- For `a_2 = 1`:
  - `start_year = (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
- For `a_3 = 1`:
  - `start_year = (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
- For `a_4 = 1`:
  - `start_year = (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
- For `a_5 = 1`:
  - `start_year = (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`
- Output: `5`

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: `6`, `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
- Initial `start_year` = 0
- For `a_1 = 50`:
  - `start_year = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
- For `a_2 = 30`:
  - `start_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
- For `a_3 = 711`:
  - `start_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
- For `a_4 = 200`:
  - `start_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`
- For `a_5 = 503`:
  - `start_year = (800 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
- For `a_6 = 1006`:
  - `start_year = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
- Output: `2012`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The formula used is correct and the program handles all the test cases as expected.
