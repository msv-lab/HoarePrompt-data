Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The key part of the program is the loop where it calculates the next occurrence of each sign, ensuring that the signs occur in sequence as required by the problem statement.

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the number of signs (`n`).
   - It reads the periodicities of the signs (`nums`).
3. **Calculating the Year**:
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0, which is the base year.
   - For each sign, the program calculates the next year when the sign will occur strictly after the previous sign. This is done using the formula `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
   - This formula ensures that `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`.
4. **Output**: The program prints the year when the n-th sign will occur.

The logic in the program is correct and matches the problem description. The program ensures that each sign occurs in sequence and calculates the correct year for the n-th sign to occur.

Correctness: **True**
