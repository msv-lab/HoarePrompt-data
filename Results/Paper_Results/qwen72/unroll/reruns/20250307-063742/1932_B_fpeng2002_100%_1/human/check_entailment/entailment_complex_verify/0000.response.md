Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the program correctly determines the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the rules specified in the problem description. Let's break down the program and the annotations to verify this claim.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num_tests` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `start_year` is initialized to 0, which represents the starting year for the first sign.

3. **Iterating Through Signs:**
   - The program iterates through each sign's periodicity using a for loop.
   - For each sign, it updates `start_year` to the next multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is strictly greater than the current `start_year`.

4. **Update Logic:**
   - The key update logic is `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
   - This line ensures that `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`.
   - This is achieved by:
     - Dividing `start_year` by `nums[x]` to find how many complete cycles of `nums[x]` fit into `start_year`.
     - Adding 1 to ensure the next cycle.
     - Multiplying by `nums[x]` to get the next multiple.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints `start_year`, which is the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

6. **Example Test Cases:**
   - Let's verify the example test cases:
     - For the input `3 2 4 5 9 18`:
       - Start with `start_year = 0`.
       - First sign (3): `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`.
       - Second sign (2): `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`.
       - Third sign (4): `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`.
       - Fourth sign (5): `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`.
       - Fifth sign (9): `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`.
       - Sixth sign (18): `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`.
     - For the input `1 2 3 4 5`:
       - Start with `start_year = 0`.
       - First sign (1): `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`.
       - Second sign (2): `start_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`.
       - Third sign (3): `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`.
       - Fourth sign (4): `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`.
       - Fifth sign (5): `start_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`.
     - For the input `1 1 1 1 1`:
       - Start with `start_year = 0`.
       - First sign (1): `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`.
       - Second sign (1): `start_year = (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`.
       - Third sign (1): `start_year = (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`.
       - Fourth sign (1): `start_year = (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`.
       - Fifth sign (1): `start_year = (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`.
     - For the input `50 30 711 200 503 1006`:
       - Start with `start_year = 0`.
       - First sign (50): `start_year = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`.
       - Second sign (30): `start_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`.
       - Third sign (711): `start_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`.
       - Fourth sign (200): `start_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`.
       - Fifth sign (503): `start_year = (800 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`.
       - Sixth sign (1006): `start_year = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly updates `start_year` to ensure that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
   - The logic handles all edge cases, including when the periodicities are 1 and when they are large numbers.
   - The example test cases provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
