Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of signs and their periodicities. The program calculates the year in which each sign will occur, ensuring that the signs occur sequentially as required. The calculation is done by finding the next occurrence of each sign after the previous sign has occurred, which is achieved by the line `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This line ensures that the start year for the next sign is the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than the current `start_year`.

The program then prints the year in which the last sign will occur, which is the year of the apocalypse according to the problem statement. The logic and implementation are correct for the given problem constraints and examples.
