Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of each sign. The approach taken is to iteratively find the smallest year that is a multiple of the current sign's periodicity, starting from the year after the previous sign occurred. This is done using the formula `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which ensures that `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to the current `start_year`.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**: `start_year` is initialized to 0, which represents the starting year.
2. **Iterative Calculation**: For each sign, the program calculates the next year in which the sign will occur. This is done by:
   - Dividing `start_year` by the current sign's periodicity `nums[x]` and adding 1 to ensure the next occurrence.
   - Multiplying the result by `nums[x]` to get the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to the current `start_year`.

This approach ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one, as required by the problem statement.

3. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `start_year`.

The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `num_tests` and processing each one in a loop.

Given the example inputs and outputs:

- For the input `3 2 4 5 9 18`:
  - The first sign occurs in year 3.
  - The second sign occurs in year 4.
  - The third sign occurs in year 8.
  - The fourth sign occurs in year 10.
  - The fifth sign occurs in year 18.
  - The sixth sign occurs in year 36.
  - The program correctly outputs 36.

- For the input `1 2 3 4 5`:
  - The first sign occurs in year 1.
  - The second sign occurs in year 2.
  - The third sign occurs in year 3.
  - The fourth sign occurs in year 4.
  - The fifth sign occurs in year 5.
  - The program correctly outputs 5.

- For the input `1 1 1 1 1`:
  - Each sign occurs every year, so the n-th sign will occur in year 5.
  - The program correctly outputs 5.

- For the input `50 30 711 200 503 1006`:
  - The first sign occurs in year 50.
  - The second sign occurs in year 60.
  - The third sign occurs in year 711.
  - The fourth sign occurs in year 800.
  - The fifth sign occurs in year 1006.
  - The sixth sign occurs in year 2012.
  - The program correctly outputs 2012.

The program's logic and output match the problem description and the provided examples.
