Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is the last input integer read, `nums` is the last list of integers read, and `start_year` is the last computed start year based on the last list of integers read. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `num_tests` is greater than 0. After each iteration, `num_tests` is decremented by 1, so after all iterations, `num_tests` will be 0.
- `n` and `nums` are updated in each iteration based on the input provided. After the loop finishes, `n` will hold the last input integer read, and `nums` will hold the last list of integers read.
- `start_year` is computed in each iteration based on the list `nums`. After the loop finishes, `start_year` will hold the last computed value based on the last `nums` list.
- The variables `t` and `a` are not modified within the loop, so their values remain unchanged.
