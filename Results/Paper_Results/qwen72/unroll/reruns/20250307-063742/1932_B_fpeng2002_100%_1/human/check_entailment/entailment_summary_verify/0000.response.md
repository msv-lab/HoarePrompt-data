### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - The program initializes `start_year` to 0, which is appropriate because it represents the starting point for the signs.

3. **Core Logic:**
   - The program iterates through each sign's periodicity in the list `nums`.
   - For each periodicity `nums[x]`, it updates `start_year` to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than the current `start_year`.
   - This is achieved by the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
   - This expression ensures that `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `start_year`, which is the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all periodicities are 1, as shown in the third test case of the example.
   - It also handles the case where periodicities are large numbers, as shown in the fourth test case of the example.
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases, as required by the problem description.

6. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function `func`.
   - It correctly states that the function reads multiple sets of inputs, processes each set, and prints the result for each set.
   - The summary also correctly notes that the function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the rules specified in the problem description. It handles all potential cases, including edge cases, and the example test cases provided match the expected output.

Final: **True**
