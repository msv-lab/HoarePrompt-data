Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the rules specified in the problem description. It initializes `start_year` to 0 and iterates through each sign's periodicity, updating `start_year` to the next multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is strictly greater than the current `start_year`. This ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one, as required. The program handles all potential cases, including when the periodicities are 1, and when the periodicities are large numbers. The example test cases provided also match the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
