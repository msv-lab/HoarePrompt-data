The function `func` reads multiple sets of inputs from the user. For each set, it first reads an integer `n`, then reads a list of `n` integers. It computes the smallest year that is a multiple of all the integers in the list and prints this year. After processing all sets of inputs, the function ensures that `num_tests` is 0, and the last processed values of `n` and `nums` remain as they were for the final set. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. The initial state of `t` and `a` remains unchanged.
