### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur sequentially. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.

2. **Calculating the Year:**
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the year in which the signs are expected to occur.
   - The program iterates over each periodicity in the list `nums`.
   - For each periodicity `nums[x]`, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur. This is done using the formula:
     ```python
     start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
     ```
     - `start_year // nums[x]` gives the number of complete cycles of `nums[x]` that fit into `start_year`.
     - Adding 1 ensures that we move to the next cycle.
     - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the actual year of the next occurrence.

3. **Output:**
   - After calculating the year for all signs, the program prints `start_year`.

### Analysis of the Formula:
- The formula `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is strictly after the previous sign's occurrence.
- For example, if `start_year` is 0 and the periodicity is 3, the next occurrence will be in year 3.
- If `start_year` is 4 and the periodicity is 2, the next occurrence will be in year 6 (since 4 // 2 = 2, 2 + 1 = 3, and 3 * 2 = 6).

### Example Walkthrough:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - `start_year` starts at 0.
  - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - After the second sign: `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - After the third sign: `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - After the sixth sign: `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
  - The output is 36, which matches the expected result.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - `start_year` starts at 0.
  - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
  - After the second sign: `start_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
  - After the third sign: `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
  - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
  - The output is 5, which matches the expected result.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - `start_year` starts at 0.
  - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
  - After the second sign: `start_year = (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
  - After the third sign: `start_year = (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
  - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
  - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`
  - The output is 5, which matches the expected result.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - `nums = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - `start_year` starts at 0.
  - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
  - After the second sign: `start_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
  - After the third sign: `start_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
  - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`
  - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (800 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
  - After the sixth sign: `start_year = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
  - The output is 2012, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The formula used is appropriate and the program handles the input and output as expected.

Correctness: **True**
