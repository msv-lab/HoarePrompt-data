### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step by step using the annotated version and the problem description.

1. **Reading the Number of Test Cases:**
   ```python
   num_tests = int(input())
   ```
   This line reads the number of test cases, which is an integer `t` such that \(1 \le t \le 1000\).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   ```python
   while num_tests > 0:
       num_tests -= 1
   ```
   This loop processes each test case one by one. The loop decrements `num_tests` by 1 after processing each test case, ensuring that all test cases are handled.

3. **Reading the Number of Signs:**
   ```python
   n = int(input())
   ```
   This line reads the number of signs `n` for the current test case, which is an integer such that \(1 \le n \le 100\).

4. **Reading the Periodicities of the Signs:**
   ```python
   nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
   ```
   This line reads the periodicities of the signs into a list `nums`. Each periodicity `a_i` is an integer such that \(1 \le a_i \le 10^6\).

5. **Initializing the Start Year:**
   ```python
   start_year = 0
   ```
   This initializes the `start_year` to 0, which is the starting point for the first sign.

6. **Iterating Through Each Sign:**
   ```python
   for x in range(0, len(nums)):
       start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
   ```
   This loop iterates through each sign's periodicity in the list `nums`. The key operation here is:
   ```python
   start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
   ```
   - `start_year // nums[x]` computes the integer division of `start_year` by `nums[x]`, which gives the number of complete cycles of `nums[x]` that fit into `start_year`.
   - `start_year // nums[x] + 1` increments this number by 1 to find the next cycle.
   - `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` computes the year of the next occurrence of the sign, which is strictly greater than the current `start_year`.

   This ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one, as required by the problem.

7. **Outputting the Result:**
   ```python
   print(start_year)
   ```
   After processing all signs, the program prints the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

### Validation of the Original Assessment:

The original assessment states that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the rules specified in the problem description. Let's validate this by considering the example test cases:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
  - Expected Output: `36`
  - **Step-by-Step:**
    - First sign: `3` (occurs in year 3)
    - Second sign: `2` (next multiple of 2 after year 3 is 4)
    - Third sign: `4` (next multiple of 4 after year 4 is 8)
    - Fourth sign: `5` (next multiple of 5 after year 8 is 10)
    - Fifth sign: `9` (next multiple of 9 after year 10 is 18)
    - Sixth sign: `18` (next multiple of 18 after year 18 is 36)
  - The program correctly outputs `36`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5`
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - **Step-by-Step:**
    - First sign: `1` (occurs in year 1)
    - Second sign: `2` (next multiple of 2 after year 1 is 2)
    - Third sign: `3` (next multiple of 3 after year 2 is 3)
    - Fourth sign: `4` (next multiple of 4 after year 3 is 4)
    - Fifth sign: `5` (next multiple of 5 after year 4 is 5)
  - The program correctly outputs `5`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `5`, `1 1 1 1 1`
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - **Step-by-Step:**
    - First sign: `1` (occurs in year 1)
    - Second sign: `1` (next multiple of 1 after year 1 is 2)
    - Third sign: `1` (next multiple of 1 after year 2 is 3)
    - Fourth sign: `1` (next multiple of 1 after year 3 is 4)
    - Fifth sign: `1` (next multiple of 1 after year 4 is 5)
  - The program correctly outputs `5`.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `6`, `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
  - Expected Output: `2012`
  - **Step-by-Step:**
    - First sign: `50` (occurs in year 50)
    - Second sign: `30` (next multiple of 30 after year 50 is 60)
    - Third sign: `711` (next multiple of 711 after year 60 is 711)
    - Fourth sign: `200` (next multiple of 200 after year 711 is 800)
    - Fifth sign: `503` (next multiple of 503 after year 800 is 1006)
    - Sixth sign: `1006` (next multiple of 1006 after year 1006 is 2012)
  - The program correctly outputs `2012`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly follows the logic described in the problem statement. It ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one by computing the next multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than the current `start_year`. The example test cases provided match the expected output, and the program handles all potential cases, including when the periodicities are 1 and when they are large numbers.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
