Reasoning:

The task is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\), which contains distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program provided prints the coordinates of cells in the form \((1, i)\) for \(i\) ranging from 1 to \(n\). This means all the cells are on the first row of the grid.

Let's analyze the Manhattan distances for this arrangement:
- For any two cells \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) where \(i \neq j\), the Manhattan distance is \(|1 - 1| + |i - j| = |i - j|\).
- The possible values of \(|i - j|\) range from 1 to \(n-1\) (since \(i\) and \(j\) are distinct and both range from 1 to \(n\)).

Thus, the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain all integers from 1 to \(n-1\), which means the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(n-1\).

However, the problem requires maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). For an \(n \times n\) grid, the maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) because the maximum number of distinct distances between any two points in the grid is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

The program's output only achieves a size of \(n-1\) for \(\mathcal{H}\), which is not the maximum possible size for \(n > 2\). Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for \(n > 2\).

For \(n = 2\), the program's output is correct as it achieves the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) (which is 2).

Since the program does not achieve the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n > 2\), it is incorrect for those cases.

Correctness: **False**
