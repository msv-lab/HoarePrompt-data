Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases. Specifically, the program always outputs points that lie on the first row of the grid, which does not ensure the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, consider the case where \(n = 3\). The program outputs the points:
```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ |1-1| + |1-2|, |1-1| + |1-3|, |1-1| + |2-3| \} = \{ 1, 2, 1 \} = \{ 1, 2 \}
\]
The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 2, but it is possible to achieve a larger set of distinct distances. For instance, the points:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
yield the set of Manhattan distances:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ |2-2| + |1-3|, |2-3| + |1-1|, |2-3| + |3-1| \} = \{ 2, 1, 3 \}
\]
The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 3, which is the maximum possible for \(n = 3\).

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
