You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', end=' ')
            print(i)
        print(' ')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem but lacks parameters in its definition. The problem requires an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) as input, and the function should output `n` points in an `n x n` grid that maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. The function should be defined with a parameter to accept `n`.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', end=' ')
            print(i)
        
        print(' ')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and in each iteration, it has printed `n` lines where each line contains "1 i" for `i` ranging from 1 to `n`. After all iterations, `t` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) and prints `n` lines, each containing the pair "1 i" where `i` ranges from 1 to `n`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and `t` is 0. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to choose \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \).
   - It then prints \( n \) points, all of which have the same \( x \)-coordinate (1) and different \( y \)-coordinates ranging from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Evaluating the Output:**
   - The program outputs points of the form \((1, i)\) for \( i \) from 1 to \( n \).
   - The Manhattan distances between any two points \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) are \( |1 - 1| + |i - j| = |i - j| \).
   - The set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) will be \(\{ |i - j| \mid 1 \le i, j \le n \}\).

4. **Distinct Manhattan Distances:**
   - The possible values for \( |i - j| \) range from 0 to \( n-1 \).
   - Therefore, the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain \( n \) distinct values: \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\).

5. **Optimality:**
   - The maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \( n \) because there are \( n \) possible distinct distances.
   - The program achieves this by placing all points on the same row, ensuring that the \( y \)-coordinates cover all possible values from 1 to \( n \).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \( n = 2 \), the program outputs \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), which gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\) with size 2.
   - For \( n = 3 \), the program outputs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((1, 3)\), which gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\) with size 3.
   - This pattern holds for any \( n \) within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly outputs \( n \) points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\). Therefore, the program is correct.
