The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is truthy (non-zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be non-zero.

State: **The function `func` is intended to solve a problem but lacks parameters in its definition. The problem requires an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) as input, and the function should output `n` points in an `n x n` grid that maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. The function should be defined with a parameter to accept `n`. `t` is an input integer and must be non-zero.**
