Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of choosing `n` cells in an `n x n` grid to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. The current implementation of the function `func` is flawed because it always prints the same set of points for any given `n`, which are all on the first row of the grid. This approach does not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

For example, consider the case when `n = 3`. The program will output:
```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```
The set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|1-1|+|1-1|, |1-1|+|1-2|, |1-1|+|1-3|, |1-1|+|2-1|, |1-1|+|2-2|, |1-1|+|2-3|, |1-1|+|3-1|, |1-1|+|3-2|, |1-1|+|3-3|\}
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0\} = \{0, 1, 2\}
\]
The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 3, which is not the maximum possible size for `n = 3`. The maximum size for `n = 3` is 4, as shown in the problem statement.

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), a better approach is to distribute the points more evenly across the grid. One effective strategy is to place points along the diagonal and anti-diagonal of the grid, which tends to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

Given the above reasoning, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem for all `n`.

Correctness: **False**
