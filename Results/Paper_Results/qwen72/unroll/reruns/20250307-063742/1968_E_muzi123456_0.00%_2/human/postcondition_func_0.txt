The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) and prints `n` lines, each containing the pair "1 i" where `i` ranges from 1 to `n`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and `t` is 0. The function does not return any value.
