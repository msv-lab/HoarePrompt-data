The function `func` should accept a parameter `n`, where `n` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function returns a set of `n` points in an `n x n` grid that maximizes the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) and returns a set of `n` points in an `n x n` grid that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points.**
