Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem but lacks parameters in its definition. The problem requires an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) as input, and the function should output `n` points in an `n x n` grid that maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. The function should be defined with a parameter to accept `n`. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print('1', end=' ')
        print(i)
    print(' ')



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
