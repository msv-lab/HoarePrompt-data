Precondition: **The function `func` is intended to solve a problem but lacks parameters in its definition. The problem requires an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) as input, and the function should output `n` points in an `n x n` grid that maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. The function should be defined with a parameter to accept `n`.**
