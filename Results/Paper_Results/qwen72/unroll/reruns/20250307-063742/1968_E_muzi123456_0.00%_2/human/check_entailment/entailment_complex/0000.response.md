Reasoning:  
The function `func` is intended to solve the problem of finding `n` points in an `n x n` grid that maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. However, the function as defined does not take any parameters, which is a problem because it needs to accept the input `n` for each test case. Despite this, the function reads `n` from the input within the loop, which is a workaround but not a clean design.

The function prints `n` points in the form `(1, i)` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n`. This means all points are on the first row of the grid. Let's analyze if this approach maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\):

1. **Manhattan Distances Calculation**:
   - For points on the first row, the Manhattan distance between any two points \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) is \(|1 - 1| + |i - j| = |i - j|\).
   - The possible values of \(|i - j|\) for \(1 \le i, j \le n\) are \(0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\).

2. **Set \(\mathcal{H}\)**:
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain all these distances, which are \(0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\).
   - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(n\), which is the maximum possible size for any set of `n` points in an `n x n` grid.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints the points in the correct format, with each point on a new line.
   - The function does not print an extra empty line at the end of each test case, which is in line with the problem's requirements.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The function processes `t` test cases correctly, reading `n` for each test case and printing the required points.

Given the above analysis, the function does indeed maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) and follows the output format correctly. Therefore, the function is correct in terms of solving the problem.

Correctness: **True**
