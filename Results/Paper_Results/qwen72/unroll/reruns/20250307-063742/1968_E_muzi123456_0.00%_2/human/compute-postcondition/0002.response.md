Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and in each iteration, it has printed `n` lines where each line contains "1 i" for `i` ranging from 1 to `n`. After all iterations, `t` is 0.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 in each iteration.
- In each iteration, the loop reads an integer `n` from the input.
- For each value of `n`, the loop prints `n` lines. Each line contains the number "1" followed by a space and then the value of `i`, where `i` ranges from 1 to `n`.
- After all iterations, the value of `t` is 0, and the loop terminates.
- The state of `n` and `i` is not preserved between iterations, as `n` is read from the input and `i` is reset for each new value of `n`.
