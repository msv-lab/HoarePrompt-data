Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program prints points that are all in the first row (with the x-coordinate always being 1), which does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for the given \(n \times n\) grid.

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the points should be chosen in a way that they cover a wide range of distances. For example, a better approach would be to place points in a way that they are spread out across the grid, such as placing them on the diagonal or in a pattern that ensures a diverse set of distances.

Here is a corrected version of the program that places points in a way that maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\):

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(i, 1)  # Place points along the first column
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            print(1, i)  # Place points along the first row (excluding the first point)
        if n % 2 == 0:
            print(n, n)  # If n is even, add the last point at (n, n)
        else:
            print(n, 1)  # If n is odd, add the last point at (n, 1)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version places points along the first column and the first row, ensuring a diverse set of Manhattan distances. For even \(n\), it adds an additional point at \((n, n)\), and for odd \(n\), it adds an additional point at \((n, 1)\). This approach should maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
