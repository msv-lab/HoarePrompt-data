The function `func` reads input from the user, processes multiple test cases, and prints the outcome for each test case. It expects the first input to be an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` representing the number of piles, and a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. The function then determines if the game can be won by Alice under certain conditions and prints 'Alice' for each test case. The final state of the program is that `tc` is 0, and the function has printed the outcome for each test case.
