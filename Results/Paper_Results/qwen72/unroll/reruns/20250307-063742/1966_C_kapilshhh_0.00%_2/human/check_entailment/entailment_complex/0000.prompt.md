Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers representing the piles of stones and an integer representing the number of test cases. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, piles):` where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `piles` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case, and each integer a_i in the inner lists satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The length of each inner list `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True) + [
            0]
        
        dp = True
        
        n = len(arr) - 1
        
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            dp = arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp
        
        print('Alice' if dp else 'Alice')
        
        tc -= 1
        
    #State: `tc` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `piles` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case, and each integer a_i in the inner lists satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The length of each inner list `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user, processes multiple test cases, and prints the outcome for each test case. It expects the first input to be an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` representing the number of piles, and a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. The function then determines if the game can be won by Alice under certain conditions and prints 'Alice' for each test case. The final state of the program is that `tc` is 0, and the function has printed the outcome for each test case.
