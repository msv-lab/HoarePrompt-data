Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the final print statement. It always prints 'Alice' regardless of the value of `dp`. This is because the print statement is:

```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Alice')
```

It should be:

```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
```

This error means that the program will not correctly output "Bob" when Bob is the winner, even if the logic to determine the winner is correct. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
