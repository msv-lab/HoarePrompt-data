Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers representing the piles of stones and an integer representing the number of test cases. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, piles):` where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `piles` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case, and each integer a_i in the inner lists satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The length of each inner list `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
