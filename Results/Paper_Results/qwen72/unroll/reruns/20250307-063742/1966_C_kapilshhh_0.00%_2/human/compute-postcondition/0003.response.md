The function `func` should accept two parameters: `t` and `piles`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `piles` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. Each integer `a_i` in the inner lists satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the length of each inner list `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case in `piles`. For each test case, the function determines the outcome based on the number of stones in the piles.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `piles`. It returns a list of results, where each result indicates the outcome for a test case based on the number of stones in the piles.**
