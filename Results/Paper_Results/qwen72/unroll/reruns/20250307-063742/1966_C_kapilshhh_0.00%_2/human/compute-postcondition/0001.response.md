The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tc` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `tc` must be greater than 0.

State: **`tc` is an input integer and `tc` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `piles` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case, and each integer a_i in the inner lists satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The length of each inner list `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
