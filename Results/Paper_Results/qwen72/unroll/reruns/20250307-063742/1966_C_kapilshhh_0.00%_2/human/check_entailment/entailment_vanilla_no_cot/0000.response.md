Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided has a logical error in the final print statement. It always prints 'Alice' regardless of the value of `dp`. The correct print statement should be:

```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
```

Additionally, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program should consider the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes. If the number of distinct pile sizes is odd, Alice wins; if it's even, Bob wins. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True) + [0]
        dp = True
        n = len(arr) - 1
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            dp = arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp
        print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
        tc -= 1
```

### Correct Logic:
1. **Distinct Pile Sizes**: The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the game is determined by the number of distinct pile sizes. If the number of distinct pile sizes is odd, Alice can always win by playing optimally. If it's even, Bob will win.
2. **Parity Check**: The program should check the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes and print the winner accordingly.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]))
        distinct_pile_sizes = len(arr)
        print('Alice' if distinct_pile_sizes % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
        tc -= 1
```

This corrected program will correctly determine the winner based on the number of distinct pile sizes.
