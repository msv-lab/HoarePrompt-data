Output State: **`q` is an integer representing Vasya's position in the line, `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, such that 1 <= x < q <= 10^9, `M` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `M`, while the values of `q` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial values of `q` and `x` along with the new state of `M`.
