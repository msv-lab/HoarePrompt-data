### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints based on Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the numbers assigned to positions follow a specific sequence: \( 1, 2, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \), and initializes \( ans \) to 0.
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is odd. If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calculates \( q = \frac{y - 2}{2} \) and calls `func_1(q, x)`.
   - It then checks if \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and, if so, calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` and adds the results to the list \( L1 \).
   - It converts \( L1 \) to a set to remove duplicates and prints the length of the set.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` is designed to find all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \) and their corresponding quotient pairs.
   - It initializes an empty list \( M \).
   - It calculates \( w = \sqrt{q} \) and checks if \( w \) is an integer and greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). If so, it appends \( w \) to \( M \).
   - It then iterates from 1 to \( w - 1 \) and checks if \( i \) is a divisor of \( q \). If \( i \) is a divisor and \( i \geq x - 1 \), it appends \( i \) to \( M \). If the quotient \( \frac{q}{i} \geq x - 1 \), it appends the quotient to \( M \).
   - Finally, it returns the list \( M \).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( y \) is odd by printing 0 and continuing to the next test case.
   - The calculation of \( q \) and the subsequent calls to `func_1` are logically sound.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \) and their corresponding quotient pairs.
   - The use of a set to remove duplicates and the final output of the length of the set are appropriate.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( y \) is odd correctly.
   - It also handles the case where \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) by making an additional call to `func_1`.
   - The constraints \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \) are respected, and the program should work within these limits.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be logically correct and handles the problem as described. It correctly identifies the divisors and their quotient pairs that fit the constraints and ensures that the results are unique by converting the list to a set.

Correctness: **True**
