Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two integers, `q` and `x`, and returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding quotient pairs that are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`. The values of `q` and `x` remain unchanged. If `q` is a perfect square and its square root is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, the square root is also included in the list `M`. **
