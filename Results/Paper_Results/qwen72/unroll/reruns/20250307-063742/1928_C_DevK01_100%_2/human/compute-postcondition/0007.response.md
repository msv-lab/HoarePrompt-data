Output State: **`i` is equal to `w`, `M` contains all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, and their corresponding quotient pairs that are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`. The values of `q`, `x`, and `w` remain unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` is no longer less than `w`. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `w`.
- **`M`**: The loop checks each integer `i` from 1 to `w-1` to see if it is a divisor of `q`. If `i` is a divisor and `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `i` is added to the list `M`. Additionally, if the quotient `q // i` is also greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it is added to `M`. This means `M` will contain all such divisors and their corresponding quotient pairs.
- **`q`, `x`, `w`**: These variables are not modified within the loop, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
