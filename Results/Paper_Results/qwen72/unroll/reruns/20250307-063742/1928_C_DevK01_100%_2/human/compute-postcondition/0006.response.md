To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `w`.

### Initial State:
- `q` is an integer representing Vasya's position in the line.
- `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, such that 1 <= x < q <= 10^9.
- `w` is the square root of `q`.
- If `w` is an integer (i.e., `q` is a perfect square) and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` contains the integer `w`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list.
- `i` is now 1.

### Loop Condition:
```
while i < w:
```
The loop will execute if `i` is less than `w`.

### Analysis:
- `i` is currently 1.
- For the loop to execute, `w` must be greater than 1.

### Adjustments:
- `i` is already 1, which is the minimum value it can be to satisfy the loop condition.
- `w` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
Since `w` is the square root of `q`, and `q` is a perfect square (if `w` is an integer), `w` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute. Therefore, `q` must be greater than 1 (since the square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of any number greater than 1 is also greater than 1).

### Final State:
State: **`q` is an integer representing Vasya's position in the line, `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, such that 1 <= x < q <= 10^9, `w` is the square root of `q` and `w` must be greater than 1, `M` is a list, and `i` is 1.**
