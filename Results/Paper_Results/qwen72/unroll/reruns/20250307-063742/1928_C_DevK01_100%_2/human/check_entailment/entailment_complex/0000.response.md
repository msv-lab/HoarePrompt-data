### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x` representing Vasya's position and the number he received during the settling.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The program checks if `y = n + x` is odd. If it is, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if `y` is odd, there can be no valid `k` that satisfies the settling pattern.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding quotient pairs.
   - It initializes an empty list `M` to store the valid divisors.
   - It calculates the square root of `q` and checks if `q` is a perfect square and if the square root is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds the square root to `M`.
   - It then iterates through all integers `i` from 1 to `w` (the square root of `q`), checking if `i` is a divisor of `q`. If `i` is a valid divisor, it adds `i` and `q // i` to `M` if they are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The program calculates `y = n + x` and checks if it is even. If it is, it proceeds to call `func_1` with `q = (y - 2) // 2` and `x`.
   - It then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2` and, if true, calls `func_1` again with `q = (n - x) // 2` and `x`.
   - It combines the results from both calls, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `y` is odd by printing `0`.
   - It also correctly handles the case where `n < 3 * x - 2` by not making the second call to `func_1`.

6. **Mathematical Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and their corresponding quotient pairs.
   - The logic for determining the valid `k` values based on the given constraints is mathematically sound.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints and the problem description. The function `func_1` is used appropriately to find the divisors, and the main logic handles the edge cases and constraints correctly.

Correctness: **True**
