Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and examples. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Initial Check**: The program checks if `n + x` is odd. If it is, it prints `0` because an odd sum of `n + x` means that the settling pattern cannot fit the given `n` and `x`.

3. **Function `func_1`**: This function is used to find all divisors of a given number `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. It does this by iterating through possible divisors and checking if they meet the criteria. The function also includes a check for the square root of `q` to optimize the divisor search.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The program calculates `y = n + x` and checks if it is even.
   - It then calls `func_1` with `((y - 2) // 2, x)` to find the divisors that could be valid `k` values.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it calls `func_1` again with `((n - x) // 2, x)` to find additional valid `k` values.
   - It combines the results from both calls, removes duplicates using `set`, and prints the length of the resulting list, which represents the number of valid `k` values.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k = 1` is not valid by ensuring `k > 1`.
   - It also correctly handles the case where `n + x` is odd, which is not possible for valid `k`.

Given the constraints and the examples provided, the program seems to be correctly implemented to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
