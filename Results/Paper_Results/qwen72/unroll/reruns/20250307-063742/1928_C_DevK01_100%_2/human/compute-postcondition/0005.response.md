Output State: **`q` is an integer representing Vasya's position in the line, `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, such that 1 <= x < q <= 10^9, `w` is the square root of `q`, and `M` is a list. If `w` is an integer (i.e., `q` is a perfect square) and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` contains the integer `w`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list. `i` is now 1.**
