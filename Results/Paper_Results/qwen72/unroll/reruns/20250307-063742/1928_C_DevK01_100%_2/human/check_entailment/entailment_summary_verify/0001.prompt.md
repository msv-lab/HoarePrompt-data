You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    i = 1
    while i < w:
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
        i += 1
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two integers, `q` and `x`, and returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding quotient pairs that are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`. The values of `q` and `x` remain unchanged. If `q` is a perfect square and its square root is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, the square root is also included in the list `M`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Settling Pattern**: The pattern of settling is such that the first \( k \) people are numbered \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k \), the next \( k-2 \) people are numbered \( k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \), and this pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
2. **Constraints**: \( 1 \leq t \leq 100 \), \( 1 \le x < n \le 10^9 \).
3. **Output**: For each test case, output the number of different \( k \) that fit the given constraints.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( x \).

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program calculates \( y = n + x \).
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case. This is because \( y \) must be even for the pattern to fit the constraints.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calculates \( (y - 2) // 2 \) and calls `func_1` with this value and \( x \).
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), it also calls `func_1` with \( (n - x) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - It combines the results from both calls, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes two parameters \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It initializes an empty list \( M \).
   - It calculates \( w = \sqrt{q} \).
   - If \( w \) is an integer and \( w \geq x - 1 \), it adds \( w \) to \( M \).
   - It iterates from 1 to \( w \) and checks if \( q \) is divisible by \( i \).
     - If \( i \geq x - 1 \), it adds \( i \) to \( M \).
     - If \( q // i \geq x - 1 \), it adds \( q // i \) to \( M \).
   - It returns the list \( M \).

### Correctness Verification:
1. **Odd \( y \) Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies that if \( y \) is odd, no \( k \) can fit the pattern, and it prints 0. This is correct because the pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions, and \( y \) must be even for the pattern to fit.

2. **Even \( y \) Check**:
   - The program correctly calculates \( (y - 2) // 2 \) and calls `func_1` with this value and \( x \).
   - The condition \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) is checked to determine if additional \( k \) values need to be considered. This condition is derived from the pattern and is correct.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly identifies potential \( k \) values by checking divisors of \( q \).
   - It ensures that the divisors are at least \( x - 1 \), which is necessary for the pattern to fit.
   - The function returns a list of valid \( k \) values.

4. **Combining Results**:
   - The program combines the results from both calls to `func_1` and removes duplicates using `set`.
   - It then prints the length of the resulting list, which is the number of valid \( k \) values.

### Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: \( n = 10 \), \( x = 2 \)
  - \( y = 12 \) (even)
  - \( (y - 2) // 2 = 5 \)
  - \( (n - x) // 2 = 4 \)
  - Valid \( k \) values: 2, 3, 5, 6
  - Output: 4 (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: \( n = 3 \), \( x = 1 \)
  - \( y = 4 \) (even)
  - \( (y - 2) // 2 = 1 \)
  - \( (n - x) // 2 = 1 \)
  - Valid \( k \) value: 2
  - Output: 1 (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: \( n = 76 \), \( x = 4 \)
  - \( y = 80 \) (even)
  - \( (y - 2) // 2 = 39 \)
  - \( (n - x) // 2 = 36 \)
  - Valid \( k \) values: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20
  - Output: 9 (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: \( n = 100 \), \( x = 99 \)
  - \( y = 199 \) (odd)
  - Output: 0 (Correct)

- **Test Case 5**: \( n = 1000000000 \), \( x = 500000000 \)
  - \( y = 1500000000 \) (even)
  - \( (y - 2) // 2 = 749999999 \)
  - \( (n - x) // 2 = 250000000 \)
  - Valid \( k \) value: 500000000
  - Output: 1 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values based on the given constraints and examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
