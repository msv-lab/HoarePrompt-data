You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns an iterator that yields integers from the input string, where the input string is split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an iterator that yields integers from an input string split by spaces. The input string is provided by the user through the `input()` function. After the function concludes, the program state includes an iterator that can be used to iterate over the integers derived from the user's input.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function `func_2` does not take any parameters.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`. Since `func_1()` is not defined in the initial state, the specific contents of the list are unknown.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling `func_1()`. The specific contents of the list are unknown because `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, and contains distinct integers from 1 to n.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains the result of `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the element `k` in `arr` if `k` is found in `arr`, otherwise `pos` remains -1.
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains the result of `func_2()`, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, otherwise `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr`, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: high, 0 (where high is the smallest index such that arr[high] > k)
    #State: *`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains the result of `func_2()`, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, otherwise `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr`, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution. If `arr[low] == k`, the current value of `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It operates on variables `n`, `k`, and `arr` that are obtained from the functions `func_1` and `func_2`. The function searches for the integer `k` in the list `arr`, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, the function prints `0`. If `k` is not found, the function prints `1` followed by the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k` and the index `pos + 1` (where `pos` is the index of `k` if it were found, otherwise `pos` remains -1). The final state of the program is that `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains the result of `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of `k` if `k` is found in `arr` (otherwise `pos` remains -1), `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, and `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the binary search algorithm needs to perform more than one swap to correctly position the element `x` in the permutation such that the binary search will find it. The program only performs one swap, which is not sufficient for all cases as the problem description allows for up to two swaps.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
The correct output should be:
```
2
4 5
2 4
```
However, the program will only output:
```
1
3 2
```
This is incorrect because after the first swap, the array becomes `[4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 6]`, and the binary search will not find `3` correctly. Another swap is needed to ensure the binary search works as intended.
