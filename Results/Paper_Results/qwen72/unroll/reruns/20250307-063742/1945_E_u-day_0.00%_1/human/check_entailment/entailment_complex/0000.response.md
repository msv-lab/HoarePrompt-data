Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers. It is used to read the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. The function is correct as it appropriately processes the input.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function reads another line of input and converts it into a list of integers. It is used to read the permutation `arr`. The function is correct as it appropriately processes the input.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is the main logic of the program. It performs the following steps:
   - Reads `n` and `k` using `func_1`.
   - Reads the permutation `arr` using `func_2`.
   - Finds the index `pos` of the element `k` in `arr`.
   - Initializes `low` and `high` for binary search.
   - Performs a binary search to find the position where `k` should be if the array were sorted.
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, it prints `0` (indicating no swaps are needed).
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate a single swap that will place `k` at the correct position.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:
- The binary search loop condition should be `low < high` instead of `low + 1 < high` to ensure the loop terminates correctly.
- The final print statement should print `low + 1` and `pos + 1` only if `pos` is not `-1` (i.e., if `k` was found in the array). If `k` was not found, the program should handle this case appropriately.

Given the problem statement, the program should always be able to find `k` in the permutation `arr` because `arr` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n` and `k` is guaranteed to be in this range. Therefore, the issue with `pos` being `-1` should not occur in valid test cases.

However, the binary search loop condition is incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results. The loop should terminate when `low` is equal to `high` or when `low` is one less than `high`, but the current condition `low + 1 < high` can cause the loop to terminate prematurely or incorrectly.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the issue with the binary search loop condition. This can lead to incorrect results in some cases, even though the overall logic is sound.
