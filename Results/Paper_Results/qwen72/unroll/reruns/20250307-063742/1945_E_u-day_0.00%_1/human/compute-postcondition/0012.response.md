Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
   - `arr` remains the result of `func_2()`.
   - `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, otherwise `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr`.
   - `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`.
   - `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`.
   - `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution.
   - `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `1`.
   - The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and objects, but none of these are used in the `print` statement itself.
   - The value `1` is an explicit integer and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
