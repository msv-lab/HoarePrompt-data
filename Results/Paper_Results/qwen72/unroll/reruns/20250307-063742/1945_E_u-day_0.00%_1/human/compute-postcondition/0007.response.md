To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `low + 1 < high`. The variables `low` and `high` are the only ones that can be adjusted to meet this condition.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n - 1`

For the loop to execute, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true. Substituting the given values:
- `0 + 1 < n - 1`
- `1 < n - 1`
- `n > 2`

Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least once. Since `high` is `n - 1`, we need to ensure that `high` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains the result of `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the element `k` in `arr` if `k` is found in `arr`, otherwise `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1` and `n` must be greater than 2**
