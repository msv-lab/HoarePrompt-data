Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
2. `arr` remains the result of `func_2()`.
3. `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, otherwise `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr`.
4. `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`.
5. `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`.
6. `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution.
7. The current value of `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(0)` statement simply prints the integer `0`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The value `0` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print(0)` statement will print the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
