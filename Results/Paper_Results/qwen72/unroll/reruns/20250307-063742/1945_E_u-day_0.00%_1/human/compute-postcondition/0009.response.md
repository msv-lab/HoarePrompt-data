Postcondition: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains the result of `func_2()`, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, otherwise `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr`, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution, and the current value of `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.**
