Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` and contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `arr` is now the result of `func_2()`.** 

The values of `n` and `k` remain as they were updated by `func_1()`. The variable `arr` is now assigned the result of `func_2()`, which is a new list of integers. The initial state of `arr` being a permutation of size `n` with distinct integers from 1 to `n` is no longer valid, as `arr` is now the output of `func_2()`.
