To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given program state and the loop head.

### Given State:
- `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`.
- `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` and contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- `arr` is now the result of `func_2()`.
- `pos` is -1.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `n`.
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
- The initial value of `i` is 0, as it is the starting point of the `range(n)`.

### Adjustments:
- We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- The variable `i` is automatically initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function.

### Final State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

Since `n` and `k` are updated by `func_1()`, and `arr` is updated by `func_2()`, we do not need to specify the exact values of `n`, `k`, or `arr` in the state, but we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
