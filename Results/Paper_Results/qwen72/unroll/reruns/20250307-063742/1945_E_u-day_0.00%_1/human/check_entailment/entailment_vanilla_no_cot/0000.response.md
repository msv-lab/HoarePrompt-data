Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue is that it only attempts to swap once, and it does not consider the possibility of performing two swaps to rearrange the permutation so that the binary search algorithm can find the number `x` at the correct position. Additionally, the logic for determining the correct swap is flawed. The program simply swaps the element at the `low` position with the element at the position of `x` after the binary search loop, which does not guarantee that the permutation will be in a state where `x` can be found correctly by the binary search.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic is correct in terms of finding the position where `x` should be if the array were sorted. However, the program does not ensure that the array is in a state where `x` can be found by the binary search after at most two swaps.

2. **Swap Logic**: The program only performs one swap and does not consider the possibility of needing two swaps to rearrange the array. The problem statement guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient, but the program does not implement this.

3. **Output Format**: The program does not always output the correct number of operations and the correct indices for the swaps. It only outputs one swap, which is not sufficient for all cases.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Identify the position of `x` in the permutation.
- Determine if `x` is already in the correct position after the binary search.
- If not, perform the necessary swaps to ensure that `x` can be found by the binary search. This might involve up to two swaps.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():
    return list(func_1())

def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
            break

    (low, high) = (0, n - 1)
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid

    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        if pos < low:
            # Swap pos with low
            print(1)
            print(pos + 1, low + 1)
        elif pos > high:
            # Swap pos with high
            print(1)
            print(pos + 1, high + 1)
        else:
            # Need two swaps
            print(2)
            # Swap pos with low
            print(pos + 1, low + 1)
            # Swap low with high
            print(low + 1, high + 1)

# Reading the number of test cases
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_3()
```

This corrected version ensures that the permutation is rearranged correctly with at most two swaps, and it outputs the correct number of operations and the indices for the swaps.
