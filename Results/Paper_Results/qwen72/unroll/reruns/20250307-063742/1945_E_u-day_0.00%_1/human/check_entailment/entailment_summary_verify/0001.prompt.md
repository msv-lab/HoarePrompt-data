You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It operates on variables `n`, `k`, and `arr` that are obtained from the functions `func_1` and `func_2`. The function searches for the integer `k` in the list `arr`, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, the function prints `0`. If `k` is not found, the function prints `1` followed by the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k` and the index `pos + 1` (where `pos` is the index of `k` if it were found, otherwise `pos` remains -1). The final state of the program is that `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains the result of `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of `k` if `k` is found in `arr` (otherwise `pos` remains -1), `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, and `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program uses `func_1` and `func_2` to parse the input. `func_1` reads a line of input and splits it into integers, while `func_2` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers. This is a common and correct way to handle input in Python.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The program correctly finds the position of `x` in the permutation `arr` by iterating through the list and setting `pos` to the index where `arr[i] == k`.

3. **Binary Search:**
   - The program initializes `low` and `high` to `0` and `n-1` respectively, which is correct for a binary search on a 0-indexed list.
   - The loop continues until `low + 1 < high`, which is the correct condition to ensure the binary search narrows down to a single element.
   - Inside the loop, the program calculates the midpoint `mid` and updates `low` or `high` based on whether `arr[mid]` is greater than or less than `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the binary search loop, the program checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. If it is, it prints `0` (indicating no swaps are needed).
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` (to swap the element at `low` with the element at `pos`).

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop. This is correct for handling multiple test cases.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position after the binary search.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position and needs to be swapped.

### Issues:
- **Binary Search Loop Condition:**
  - The loop condition `low + 1 < high` is correct for binary search, but it might not always find the correct position if the permutation is not sorted. However, the problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient to make the binary search work, so this condition is acceptable.

- **Swapping Indices:**
  - The program only performs one swap if `x` is not found in the correct position. The problem states that up to 2 swaps can be performed, but the program only does one. This might be a valid solution if one swap is sufficient, but it's not clear if this is always the case.

- **Output Format:**
  - The output format is correct as per the problem statement. The program prints the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for the given problem description. It correctly parses the input, finds the position of `x`, performs a binary search, and outputs the necessary swaps. The program does not always use the maximum allowed 2 swaps, but it is not required to do so. The problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, and the program ensures that `x` is found in the correct position with at most one swap.
