Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` and contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `arr` is now the result of `func_2()`, `pos` is -1.**

The variable `pos` is assigned the value -1. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` and contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`, which is now the result of `func_2()`. All other information from the initial state remains unchanged.
