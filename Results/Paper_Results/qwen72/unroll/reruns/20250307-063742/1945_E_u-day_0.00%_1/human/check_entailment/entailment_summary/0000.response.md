Reasoning:  
The problem requires rearranging a permutation using at most 2 swaps before performing a binary search to ensure that the element `x` is found at the correct position. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used to read input and convert it into a usable format. The main logic is implemented in `func_3`.

### Analysis of `func_3`:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - `(n, k) = func_1()`: Reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   - `arr = func_2()`: Reads a list of integers from the input, which is the permutation `p`.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`**:
   - `pos = -1`: Initializes `pos` to -1, which will store the index of `k` in `arr`.
   - `for i in range(n)`: Iterates through the list `arr` to find the index of `k`.
   - `if arr[i] == k: pos = i`: If `k` is found, `pos` is updated to the index of `k`.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - `(low, high) = (0, n - 1)`: Initializes the binary search bounds.
   - `st = set()`: Initializes a set to keep track of midpoints.
   - `while low + 1 < high`: Executes the binary search loop.
     - `mid = (low + high) // 2`: Calculates the midpoint.
     - `st.add(mid)`: Adds the midpoint to the set.
     - `if arr[mid] > k: high = mid`: Adjusts the high bound if the midpoint value is greater than `k`.
     - `else: low = mid`: Adjusts the low bound if the midpoint value is less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Output**:
   - `if arr[low] == k: print(0)`: If `k` is found at the `low` index, prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - `else: print(1) \n print(low + 1, pos + 1)`: If `k` is not found at the `low` index, prints `1` followed by the indices to swap to correct the position of `k`.

### Issues with the Solution:
1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic is correct in terms of finding the position where `k` should be if the array were sorted. However, the problem requires ensuring that `k` is found at the correct position after at most 2 swaps.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function only performs one swap, which is not always sufficient to ensure that `k` is found at the correct position. The problem statement guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, but the function does not handle this case.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle cases where `k` is not in the array or where multiple swaps are needed to correct the position of `k`.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is incorrect because it only performs one swap, which is not always sufficient to ensure that `k` is found at the correct position after the binary search. The problem requires handling up to 2 swaps to ensure the correct position of `k`.

Correctness: **False**
