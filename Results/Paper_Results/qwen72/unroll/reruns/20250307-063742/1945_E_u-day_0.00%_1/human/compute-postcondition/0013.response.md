To determine what will be printed by the `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the implications of each variable:

1. **`n` and `k` remain unchanged**: These are constants or values that do not change during the execution.
2. **`arr` remains the result of `func_2()`**: This means `arr` is a list that has been returned by the function `func_2()`.
3. **`pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, otherwise `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr`**: This indicates that `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise it is -1.
4. **`low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`**: This means `low` is the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`.
5. **`high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`**: This means `high` is the index of the smallest element in `arr` that is greater than `k`.
6. **`st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution**: This is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
7. **`arr[low]` is not equal to `k`**: This means that the element at index `low` in `arr` is not equal to `k`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` statement:

- **`low + 1`**: Since `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, adding 1 to `low` will give the index of the next element in the list, which is the smallest element greater than `k` (i.e., `high`).
- **`pos + 1`**: If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` is -1, so `pos + 1` will be 0. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of `k`, and `pos + 1` will be the index of `k` plus 1.

However, the precondition states that `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, which implies that `k` is not found in `arr`. Therefore, `pos` must be -1.

So, the `print` statement will output:
- `low + 1` which is the index of the smallest element greater than `k` (i.e., `high`).
- `pos + 1` which is 0 (since `pos` is -1).

Output: **high, 0 (where high is the smallest index such that arr[high] > k)**
