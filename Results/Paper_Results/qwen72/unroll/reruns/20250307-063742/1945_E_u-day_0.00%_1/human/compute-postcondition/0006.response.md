Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains the result of `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the element `k` in `arr` if `k` is found in `arr`, otherwise `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is an empty set.**

The code initializes `st` as an empty set, but does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, or `high`. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition of `st` being an empty set.
