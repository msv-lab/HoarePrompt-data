Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, and contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`.** 

Explanation: The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_1()`. The initial state of `arr` remains unchanged, and it continues to be a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
