Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains the result of `func_2()`, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, otherwise `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr`, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `k`**: These variables are not modified within the loop, so they remain unchanged.
- **`arr`**: This array is not modified within the loop, so it remains the result of `func_2()`.
- **`pos`**: This variable is not modified within the loop, so it remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. If `k` is found, `pos` will still be the index of `k` in `arr` as determined before the loop.
- **`low`**: After the loop, `low` will be the largest index in `arr` such that `arr[low] <= k`. This is because the loop continues to adjust `low` and `high` until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`.
- **`high`**: After the loop, `high` will be the smallest index in `arr` such that `arr[high] > k`. This is because the loop continues to adjust `low` and `high` until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`.
- **`st`**: This set will contain all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution. Each midpoint is added to `st` in the loop body.
