### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `input()`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_3()`.
   - `func_1()` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   - `func_2()` reads a list of integers `arr` from the input, which is supposed to be a permutation of size `n`.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`:**
   - The program iterates through the list `arr` to find the index `pos` of the element `k`.
   - If `k` is found, `pos` is set to the index of `k`. Otherwise, `pos` remains `-1`.

3. **Binary Search:**
   - The program initializes `low` and `high` to `0` and `n - 1` respectively.
   - It performs a binary search to find the position where `k` should be if the array were sorted.
   - The loop continues until `low + 1 < high`, which means the search space is reduced to two elements.
   - During each iteration, the midpoint `mid` is calculated, and the program updates `low` or `high` based on whether `arr[mid]` is greater than or less than `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the binary search, the program checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.
   - If `arr[low] == k`, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - If `arr[low] != k`, it prints `1` (one swap needed) and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to swap the elements at these positions.

### Issues:
- **Binary Search Initialization:**
  - The binary search initialization should be `low = 0` and `high = n` (not `n - 1`), but the program correctly uses `low = 0` and `high = n - 1` for the search.
  - The loop condition `low + 1 < high` is correct for the binary search to terminate when the search space is reduced to two elements.

- **Swapping Logic:**
  - The program prints the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to swap the elements. This is correct because `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, and `pos` is the actual index of `k` in the permutation.
  - However, the program does not actually perform the swap; it only prints the indices. This is acceptable for the problem since the task is to output the swap operations, not to modify the array.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where `k` is already in the correct position (`arr[low] == k`).
  - The program also correctly handles the case where `k` is not in the correct position by suggesting a swap.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the indices to swap to ensure that `k` is found at the correct position after the binary search. The logic and the output format match the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
