Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the binary search algorithm needs to perform more than one swap to correctly position the element `x` in the permutation such that the binary search will find it. The program only performs one swap, which is not sufficient for all cases as the problem description allows for up to two swaps.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
The correct output should be:
```
2
4 5
2 4
```
However, the program will only output:
```
1
3 2
```
This is incorrect because after the first swap, the array becomes `[4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 6]`, and the binary search will not find `3` correctly. Another swap is needed to ensure the binary search works as intended.
