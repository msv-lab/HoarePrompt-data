### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly uses `func_1` and `func_2` to parse the input. `func_1` reads a line of input and splits it into integers, while `func_2` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers. This is a standard and correct way to handle input in Python.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The program correctly finds the position of `x` in the permutation `arr` by iterating through the list and setting `pos` to the index where `arr[i] == k`.

3. **Binary Search:**
   - The program initializes `low` and `high` to `0` and `n-1` respectively, which is correct for a binary search on a 0-indexed list.
   - The loop continues until `low + 1 < high`, which is the correct condition to ensure the binary search narrows down to a single element.
   - Inside the loop, the program calculates the midpoint `mid` and updates `low` or `high` based on whether `arr[mid]` is greater than or less than `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the binary search loop, the program checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. If it is, it prints `0` (indicating no swaps are needed).
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` (to swap the element at `low` with the element at `pos`).

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop. This is correct for handling multiple test cases.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position after the binary search.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position and needs to be swapped.

### Issues:
- **Binary Search Loop Condition:**
  - The loop condition `low + 1 < high` is correct for binary search, but it might not always find the correct position if the permutation is not sorted. However, the problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient to make the binary search work, so this condition is acceptable.

- **Swapping Indices:**
  - The program only performs one swap if `x` is not found in the correct position. The problem states that up to 2 swaps can be performed, but the program only does one. This might be a valid solution if one swap is sufficient, but it's not clear if this is always the case. The function summary and the problem description suggest that 2 swaps are always sufficient, but the program does not always use the maximum allowed 2 swaps. This could be a limitation, but it is not necessarily incorrect if the single swap is sufficient.

- **Output Format:**
  - The output format is correct as per the problem statement. The program prints the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for the given problem description. It correctly parses the input, finds the position of `x`, performs a binary search, and outputs the necessary swaps. The program does not always use the maximum allowed 2 swaps, but it is not required to do so. The problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, and the program ensures that `x` is found in the correct position with at most one swap.

However, the function summary and the problem description suggest that 2 swaps are always sufficient, and the program only performs one swap. This could be a limitation, but it is not necessarily incorrect if the single swap is sufficient to achieve the goal. Given the problem constraints and the fact that the program works for the provided examples, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
