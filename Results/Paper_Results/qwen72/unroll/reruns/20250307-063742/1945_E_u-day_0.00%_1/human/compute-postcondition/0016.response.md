Functionality: ** The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It operates on variables `n`, `k`, and `arr` that are obtained from the functions `func_1` and `func_2`. The function searches for the integer `k` in the list `arr`, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, the function prints `0`. If `k` is not found, the function prints `1` followed by the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k` and the index `pos + 1` (where `pos` is the index of `k` if it were found, otherwise `pos` remains -1). The final state of the program is that `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains the result of `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of `k` if `k` is found in `arr` (otherwise `pos` remains -1), `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, and `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution. **
