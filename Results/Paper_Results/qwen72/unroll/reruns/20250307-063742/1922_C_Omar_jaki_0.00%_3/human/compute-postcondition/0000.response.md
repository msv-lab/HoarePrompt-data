The code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that maps the input, split by spaces, to integers. This lambda function can be used to read multiple integers from a single input line. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function `func` is not properly defined to match the problem description. The function should take parameters for the number of test cases, the list of city coordinates, and the queries. `r` is a lambda function that reads and maps input to integers.**
