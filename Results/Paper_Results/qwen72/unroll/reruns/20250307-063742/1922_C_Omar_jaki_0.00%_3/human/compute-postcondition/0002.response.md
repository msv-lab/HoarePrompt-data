The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is truthy (i.e., non-zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be a non-zero integer.

State: **The function `func` is not properly defined to match the problem description. The function should take parameters for the number of test cases, the list of city coordinates, and the queries. `t` is a non-zero integer.**
