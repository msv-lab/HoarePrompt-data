The function `func` should accept three parameters: `t`, `cities`, and `queries`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). `cities` is a list of integers representing the coordinates of cities, where the coordinates are in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) and the length of the list is n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i), with the length of the list being m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The function returns a list of results for each query, where each result is the distance between the cities specified in the query.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `cities` (a list of city coordinates), and `queries` (a list of city pairs). It returns a list of distances between the city pairs specified in the queries.**
