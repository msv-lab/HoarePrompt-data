#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not properly defined to match the problem description. The function should take parameters for the number of test cases, the list of city coordinates, and the queries. For example, it should be defined as `def func(t, cities, queries):` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cities` is a list of integers (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) with length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i), with the length of the list being m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5). Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        r()
        
        a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
        
        b = [0, 0]
        
        for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
        
        print(b, 'B')
        
        u, = r()
        
        while u:
            u -= 1
            c, d = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
        
    #State: The value of `t` is 0, and the value of `u` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of city coordinates and a list of queries. It then calculates and prints the cumulative distances between city pairs specified in the queries. The function does not return any values but prints the results directly. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the number of remaining test cases (`t`) and the number of remaining queries (`u`) are both 0.
