Output State: **The value of `t` is 0, and the value of `u` is 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: The loop starts with `t` being assigned the value of the first integer from the input. The outer loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 each time until `t` becomes 0. Inside the outer loop, `u` is assigned a value from the input, and the inner loop runs `u` times, decrementing `u` by 1 each time until `u` becomes 0. After all iterations of both loops, `t` and `u` will both be 0. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `v`) are local to the loop and will not affect the initial state outside the loop.
