You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not properly defined to match the problem description. The function should take parameters for the number of test cases, the list of city coordinates, and the queries. For example, it should be defined as `def func(t, cities, queries):` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cities` is a list of integers (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) with length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i), with the length of the list being m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5). Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())

        b = [0, 0]
        
        for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
        
        print(b, 'B')
        
        u, = r()
        
        while u:
            u -= 1
            c, d = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
        
    #State: The value of `t` is 0, and the value of `u` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of city coordinates and a list of queries. It then calculates and prints the cumulative distances between city pairs specified in the queries. The function does not return any values but prints the results directly. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the number of remaining test cases (`t`) and the number of remaining queries (`u`) are both 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the cities are located in such a way that the closest city is not unique. The problem description explicitly states that for every city, the closest city is determined uniquely. However, the program does not check for this condition, and it may produce incorrect results if the input violates this constraint.

Additionally, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities in some cases. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output is:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the program's logic for calculating the minimum number of coins is flawed. Specifically, the use of `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)` to determine the cost of moving to the closest city is incorrect. This expression does not correctly handle the cost of moving to the closest city, and it may produce incorrect results.

For instance, in the query `(1, 4)`, the program should output `3` coins, but the logic used in the program may not correctly compute this value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
