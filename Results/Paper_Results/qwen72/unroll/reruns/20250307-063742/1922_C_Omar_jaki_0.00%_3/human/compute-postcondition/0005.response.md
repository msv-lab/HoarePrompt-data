Functionality: ** The function reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of city coordinates and a list of queries. It then calculates and prints the cumulative distances between city pairs specified in the queries. The function does not return any values but prints the results directly. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the number of remaining test cases (`t`) and the number of remaining queries (`u`) are both 0. **
