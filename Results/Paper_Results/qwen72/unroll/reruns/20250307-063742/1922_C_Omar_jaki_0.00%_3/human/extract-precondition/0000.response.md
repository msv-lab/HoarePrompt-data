Precondition: **The function `func` is not properly defined to match the problem description. The function should take parameters for the number of test cases, the list of city coordinates, and the queries. For example, it should be defined as `def func(t, cities, queries):` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cities` is a list of integers (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) with length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i), with the length of the list being m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5). Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
