You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5 1

Output

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not properly defined to match the problem description. The function should take parameters for the number of test cases, the list of city coordinates, and the queries. For example, it should be defined as `def func(t, cities, queries):` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cities` is a list of integers (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) with length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i), with the length of the list being m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5). Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - The number of cities `n`.
     - The coordinates of the cities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` in ascending order.
     - The number of queries `m`.
     - Each query consists of two cities `x_i` and `y_i`.

2. **Output:**
   - For each query, the minimum number of coins required to travel from city `x_i` to city `y_i`.

3. **Constraints:**
   - The closest city to any city is unique.
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).
   - The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using a lambda function `r` that maps input to integers.
   - It then processes each test case in a while loop.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program reads the number of cities `n` and the coordinates of the cities `a`.
   - It pads the list of coordinates with `-1000000000.0` at the beginning and `2000000000.0` at the end. This is done to handle edge cases where the closest city might be the first or last city.
   - It initializes a list `b` with two zeros.

3. **Calculating Minimum Coins:**
   - The program uses a for loop with `zip` to iterate over the coordinates in groups of four.
   - For each group of coordinates `(w, x, y, z)`, it calculates the distance `v` between `y` and `x`.
   - It updates the list `b` based on the distances:
     - `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`: This adds the distance `v` to the second last element of `b` if `v` is greater than the distance between `x` and `w`.
     - `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`: This adds the distance `v` to the last element of `b` if `v` is greater than the distance between `z` and `y`.
   - The list `b` is printed for debugging purposes.

4. **Processing Queries:**
   - The program reads the number of queries `m` and processes each query in a while loop.
   - For each query, it reads the cities `c` and `d`.
   - If `c < d`, it prints the difference between the appropriate elements in `b`.
   - If `c > d`, it prints the difference between the appropriate elements in `b`.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Padding Coordinates:**
   - The padding with `-1000000000.0` and `2000000000.0` is intended to handle edge cases, but it might not be necessary given the constraints that the closest city is unique and the cities are in ascending order.

2. **Updating List `b`:**
   - The update logic for `b` is not clear. The use of `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)` is a bit unconventional. It seems to be using the fact that `1` is returned if the condition is true, and `0` otherwise, but this is not a standard way to handle such conditions in Python.
   - The logic for updating `b` should be more straightforward and directly related to the problem's requirements.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - The query processing logic is based on the differences in the elements of `b`, but the correctness of these differences is not guaranteed by the current logic for updating `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for updating the list `b` and processing the queries is not clear and does not seem to correctly implement the problem's requirements. The use of unconventional operations and the lack of clear explanation for the updates make it difficult to verify the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **False**
