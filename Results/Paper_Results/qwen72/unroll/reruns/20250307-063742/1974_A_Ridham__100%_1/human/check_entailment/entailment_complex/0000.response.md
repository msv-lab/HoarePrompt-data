Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y` for each case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Space Calculation**: The program calculates the total space required for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons. This is done by:
   - `space_x = x * 1` for 1x1 icons.
   - `space_y = y * 4` for 2x2 icons.
   - `total_space = space_y + space_x` for the total space required.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. Since each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons (as a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells and a screen has 15 cells), the calculation is:
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` if `y` is even.
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
   - This is correct because if `y` is odd, one additional screen is needed to accommodate the last 2x2 icon.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the remaining cells available on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons:
     - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`
   - This is correct because each screen has 15 cells, and the total number of cells used by 2x2 icons is `space_y`.

5. **Checking for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program checks if the remaining cells are sufficient to accommodate all 1x1 icons:
     - If `space_x <= remaining_cells`, then the number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
     - If `space_x > remaining_cells`, then additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons:
       - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`
       - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15` if `extra_space` is a multiple of 15.
       - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space` is not a multiple of 15.
   - This is correct because it ensures that any remaining 1x1 icons are placed on additional screens, and the calculation for the number of additional screens is accurate.

6. **Output**:
   - The program appends the total number of screens required for each test case to the `result` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results, one per line, which matches the output format specified in the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle the input, perform the necessary calculations, and produce the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
