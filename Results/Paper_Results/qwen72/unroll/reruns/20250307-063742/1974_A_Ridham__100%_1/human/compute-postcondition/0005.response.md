The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function operates on multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. The function is expected to process these test cases and return a result for each one. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99) and returns a result for each test case.**
