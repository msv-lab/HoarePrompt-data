Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `result` is a list containing the number of screens required for each test case.
   - The length of `result` is equal to `n`.
   - The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `map(str, result)` function converts each element in the `result` list to a string.
   - The `'\n'.join(...)` function joins these string elements with a newline character, effectively creating a single string where each element of `result` is on a new line.
   - The `print` function then outputs this string to the console.

4. **Output**:
   - Since `result` is a list of integers representing the number of screens required for each test case, and the length of `result` is `n`, the output will be a string where each integer in `result` is printed on a new line.

Given the initial state, the output will be the elements of the `result` list, each on a new line. Since the exact values of `result` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `result`.

Output: **[result[0]]
[result[1]]
...
[result[n-1]] (where each element is the number of screens required for the corresponding test case)**
