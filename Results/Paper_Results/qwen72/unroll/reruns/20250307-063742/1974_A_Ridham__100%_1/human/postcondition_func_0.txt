The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99). The function calculates the number of screens required based on the space occupied by `x` and `y` and appends this number to a list `result`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of `result` on a new line, where each element represents the number of screens required for the corresponding test case. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged after the function execution.
