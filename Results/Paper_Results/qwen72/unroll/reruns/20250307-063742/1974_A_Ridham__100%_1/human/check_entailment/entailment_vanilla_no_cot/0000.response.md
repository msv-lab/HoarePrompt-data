Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. The program assumes that each 2x2 icon will take up half a screen, but this is not always the case. A single screen can fit more than two 2x2 icons, and the program does not account for this. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Calculate the minimum number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_y = (y * 4 + 14) // 15
        # Calculate the remaining space on these screens
        remaining_cells = screens_for_y * 15 - y * 4
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        extra_screens_for_x = (x - remaining_cells + 14) // 15
        # Total screens required
        total_screens = screens_for_y + extra_screens_for_x
        result.append(total_screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons and then determines how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space on those screens. If there are still 1x1 icons left that cannot fit, it calculates the additional screens required for them. This approach ensures that the minimum number of screens is used.
