### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - It then iterates `n` times, reading the values of `x` and `y` for each test case.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x`) and 2x2 icons (`space_y`).
   - The total space required is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons.
   - If the number of 2x2 icons `y` is even, it divides `y` by 2 to get the number of screens required.
   - If `y` is odd, it divides `y` by 2 and adds 1 to account for the extra screen needed for the last 2x2 icon.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the remaining cells available on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - It then checks if the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`space_x`).

5. **Extra Screen Calculation:**
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, it calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the extra space required is a multiple of 15 (the total number of cells in one screen) and where it is not.

6. **Output:**
   - The program appends the total number of screens required for each test case to the `result` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Correctness:
The program follows the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases correctly. It ensures that the minimum number of screens is used to place all the icons, and the output format matches the expected output.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
