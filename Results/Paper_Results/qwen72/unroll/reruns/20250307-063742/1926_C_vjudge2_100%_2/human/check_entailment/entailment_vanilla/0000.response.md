Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
- Vladislav writes integers from 1 to \( n \) on the board.
- Each integer is replaced with the sum of its digits.
- The task is to find the sum of the numbers on the board after the replacement.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Precomputation of Sums:**
   - The program starts by precomputing the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000.
   - It uses a list `A` to store the cumulative sum of digit sums.
   - The variable `sum` is used to keep track of the cumulative sum as it iterates through the numbers from 1 to 200,000.
   - For each number \( i \), it calls `func_1(i)` to get the sum of the digits of \( i \).
   - It then adds this sum to the cumulative sum and appends the cumulative sum to the list `A`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes an integer `num` and returns the sum of its digits.
   - It initializes a variable `a` to 0.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of `num` using `num % 10` and add it to `a`.
   - It then removes the last digit from `num` using `int(num / 10)`.
   - The loop continues until `num` becomes 0.
   - Finally, it returns the sum of the digits stored in `a`.

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).
   - It then prints the precomputed cumulative sum for \( n \) by accessing `A[n - 1]`.

### Correctness Check:
- **Precomputation:**
  - The precomputation step correctly calculates the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000.
  - The cumulative sum is stored in the list `A`, which allows for efficient retrieval of the sum for any \( n \) within the range.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number.
  - The use of `num % 10` and `int(num / 10)` is a standard and correct approach to sum the digits of a number.

- **Test Case Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
  - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \) and prints the precomputed sum from the list `A`.
  - The index `n - 1` is used to access the correct cumulative sum for the given \( n \).

- **Efficiency:**
  - The precomputation step runs in \( O(n \log n) \) time, where \( n \) is 200,000. This is efficient and within the time limit for the problem.
  - Each test case is handled in \( O(1) \) time by simply accessing the precomputed list, which is very efficient.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described. It precomputes the required sums and handles test cases in constant time, ensuring that it meets the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Correctness: **True**
