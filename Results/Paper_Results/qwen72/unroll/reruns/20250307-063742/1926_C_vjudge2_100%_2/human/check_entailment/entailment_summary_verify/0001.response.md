### Reasoning:

1. **Precomputation of Sums:**
   - The program correctly precomputes the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000.
   - The list `A` is used to store the cumulative sum of these digit sums.
   - The variable `sum` is used to keep track of the cumulative sum as it iterates through the numbers from 1 to 200,000.
   - For each number \( i \), it calls `func_1(i)` to get the sum of the digits of \( i \).
   - It then adds this sum to the cumulative sum and appends the cumulative sum to the list `A`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number.
   - It initializes a variable `a` to 0.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of `num` using `num % 10` and add it to `a`.
   - It then removes the last digit from `num` using `int(num / 10)`.
   - The loop continues until `num` becomes 0.
   - Finally, it returns the sum of the digits stored in `a`.

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).
   - It then prints the precomputed cumulative sum for \( n \) by accessing `A[n - 1]`.
   - The index `n - 1` is used to access the correct cumulative sum for the given \( n \).

4. **Efficiency:**
   - The precomputation step runs in \( O(n \log n) \) time, where \( n \) is 200,000. This is efficient and within the time limit for the problem.
   - Each test case is handled in \( O(1) \) time by simply accessing the precomputed list, which is very efficient.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly precomputes the required sums and handles test cases efficiently, ensuring that it meets the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Final: **True**
