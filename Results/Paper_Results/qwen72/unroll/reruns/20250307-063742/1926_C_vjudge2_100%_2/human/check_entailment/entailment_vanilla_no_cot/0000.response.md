Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct for the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Precomputation of Sums**:
   - The program precomputes the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores these sums in the list `A`.
   - This is efficient because it avoids recalculating the sum of digit sums for each test case, which would be computationally expensive given the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1(num)` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `num`.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of `num` and add it to the sum `a`, then removes the last digit by integer division.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the value of `n`.
   - For each `n`, it prints the precomputed sum `A[n - 1]`, which corresponds to the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - The output for each test case is the correct sum of the digit sums for the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program efficiently computes the required sums and handles the input and output correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
