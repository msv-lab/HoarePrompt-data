### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` set to 0.
   - It then iterates from 1 to 200000, computing the sum of the digits of each number using the function `func_1`.
   - The result of `func_1(i)` is added to `sum`, and the current value of `sum` is appended to the list `A`.
   - This precomputation step ensures that `A[n - 1]` will contain the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n` for any `n` in the range [1, 200000].

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(num)` correctly computes the sum of the digits of `num`.
   - It initializes `a` to 0 and uses a while loop to repeatedly add the last digit of `num` to `a` and then remove the last digit by integer division.
   - The loop continues until `num` becomes 0, at which point `a` contains the sum of the digits of the initial value of `num`.
   - The function returns `a`, which is the correct sum of the digits.

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the precomputed value `A[n - 1]`.
   - This approach is efficient because it avoids recomputing the sum of digit sums for each test case, which is crucial given the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct. It precomputes the sum of digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200000 and then efficiently handles multiple test cases by looking up the precomputed values. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a number, and the overall logic is sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
