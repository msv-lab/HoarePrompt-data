Output State: **`num` is 0, `a` is the sum of the digits of the initial value of `num`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has finished executing, the value of `num` will be 0 because the loop continuously divides `num` by 10 until it becomes 0. The value of `a` will be the sum of all the digits in the initial value of `num`. For example, if `num` was initially 1234, `a` would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
