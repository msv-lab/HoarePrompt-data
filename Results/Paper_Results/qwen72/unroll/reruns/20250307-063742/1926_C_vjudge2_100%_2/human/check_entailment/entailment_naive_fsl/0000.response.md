Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the solution for the problem. It precomputes the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores these sums in a list `A`. For each test case, it reads the input `n` and prints the precomputed sum from the list `A`. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number. The program efficiently handles the time constraint by precomputing the results, ensuring that each test case is processed in constant time. I cannot find any edge cases or potential inputs where the program would fail to produce the correct output.
