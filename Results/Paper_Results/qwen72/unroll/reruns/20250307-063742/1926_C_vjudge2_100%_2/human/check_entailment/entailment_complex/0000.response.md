### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` to 0.
   - It then iterates from 1 to 200000, computing the sum of the digits of each number using the function `func_1`.
   - The result of `func_1(i)` is added to `sum`, and the updated `sum` is appended to the list `A`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `num` and computes the sum of its digits.
   - It initializes a variable `a` to 0.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of `num` and add it to `a`, then removes the last digit by integer division.
   - The loop continues until `num` becomes 0.
   - The function returns the sum of the digits, which is stored in `a`.

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the precomputed sum from the list `A` at index `n - 1`.

4. **Efficiency:**
   - The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, where n is the range of numbers (1 to 200000).
   - Each test case is handled in O(1) time by directly accessing the precomputed list `A`.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a number.
   - The list `A` is correctly precomputed to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to 200000.
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by accessing the precomputed values in constant time.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It efficiently precomputes the required values and handles multiple test cases within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
