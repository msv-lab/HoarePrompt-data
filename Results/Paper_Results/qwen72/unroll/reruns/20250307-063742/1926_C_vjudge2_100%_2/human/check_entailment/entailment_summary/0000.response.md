Reasoning:  
The program is designed to precompute the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and store these sums in a list `A`. This allows for quick lookup when processing multiple test cases, which is crucial given the time constraint of 0.5 seconds per test case.

1. **Precomputation**:
   - The program iterates from 1 to 200,000, computing the sum of the digits for each number using the function `func_1`.
   - The cumulative sum of these digit sums is stored in the list `A`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number `num`.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of `num` and add it to the sum `a`, then removes the last digit by integer division.

3. **Test Case Processing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and prints the precomputed sum from the list `A` at index `n - 1`.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, where n is 200,000. This is done once and is acceptable given the problem constraints.
   - Each test case is processed in O(1) time by simply accessing the precomputed list `A`.

5. **Output**:
   - The output for each test case is the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n`, which is correctly stored in `A[n - 1]`.

Given the above points, the program correctly solves the problem and meets the time constraints.

Correctness: **True**
