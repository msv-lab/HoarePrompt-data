The function should accept three parameters: the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the width of the grid, and two binary strings a1 and a2 of length n, representing the top and bottom rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
