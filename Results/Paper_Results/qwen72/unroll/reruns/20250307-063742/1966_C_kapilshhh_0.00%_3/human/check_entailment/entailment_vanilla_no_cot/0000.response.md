Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program has a logical error in the final print statement. The program should print "Alice" if `dp` is `True` and "Bob" if `dp` is `False`. However, the program incorrectly prints "Alice" in both cases. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True) + [0]
        dp = True
        n = len(arr) - 1
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            dp = arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp
        print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
        tc -= 1
```

With this correction, the program should work as intended to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description.
