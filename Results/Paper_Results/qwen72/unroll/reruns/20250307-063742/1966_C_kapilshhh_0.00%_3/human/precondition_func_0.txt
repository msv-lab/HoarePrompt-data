The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each sublist contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. t should satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, the number of piles n should satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and the number of stones in each pile a_i should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 2·10^5.
