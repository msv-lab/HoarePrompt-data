The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tc` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. For the loop to execute the first time, `tc` must be greater than 0.

State: **`tc` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and `tc` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each sublist contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 2Â·10^5.**
