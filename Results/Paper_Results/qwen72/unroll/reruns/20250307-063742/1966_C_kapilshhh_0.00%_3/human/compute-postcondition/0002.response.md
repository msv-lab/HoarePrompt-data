Output State: **`tc` is 0, `t` remains unchanged, and the list of lists remains unchanged.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `tc` starts as an input integer representing the number of test cases. After each iteration of the loop, `tc` is decremented by 1. Once the loop has run `tc` times, `tc` will be 0.
- The variable `t` is not modified within the loop, so it remains unchanged.
- The list of lists, which contains the number of stones in each pile for each test case, is not modified within the loop, so it remains unchanged.
- The loop processes each test case by reading the number of piles `n` and the number of stones in each pile, then it performs some operations to determine if the result is "Alice" or "Alice" (which is always "Alice" in this case due to the logic in the loop).
- After all iterations, the loop will have processed all test cases, and `tc` will be 0, indicating that there are no more test cases to process.
