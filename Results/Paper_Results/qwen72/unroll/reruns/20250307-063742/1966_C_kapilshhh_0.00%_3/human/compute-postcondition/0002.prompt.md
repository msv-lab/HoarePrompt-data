Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tc` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each sublist contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 2Â·10^5.
Code of the loop:
while tc > 0:
    n = int(input())
    arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True
        ) + [0]
    dp = True
    n = len(arr) - 1
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        dp = arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp
    print('Alice' if dp else 'Alice')
    tc -= 1



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
