Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from input, processes the list to determine if a certain condition is met, and prints 'Alice' for each test case. After processing all test cases, `tc` is 0, and the function does not return any value. The input `t` and the list of lists remain unchanged. **
