You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `number` and `quantity`. It returns an integer value of 0, regardless of the input parameters. The function does not modify the input parameters or return a list as suggested in the annotation.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, summing its elements, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
   - `func_1` is a simple function that returns the modulo of a number.
   - `func_2` is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
   - `func_3` is incomplete and does not perform any operation.

3. **Function Analysis:**

   - **`func_1`:**
     - This function correctly computes the modulo of a number with \(10^9 + 7\).
     - It is a straightforward and correct implementation for the given task.

   - **`func_2`:**
     - This function aims to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - The logic is flawed:
       - The function initializes `max_segment` and `new_segment` as lists with a single element.
       - It iterates through the array and updates `new_segment` and `max_segment` based on the current element.
       - However, the way it handles negative and positive elements is incorrect. It does not correctly identify the maximum subarray sum.
       - The function appends segments to `segments_variants` but does not handle the case where the array ends with a positive segment correctly.
       - The final loop to find the maximum segment is also flawed because it does not handle the case where `total_max_segment` is initialized to \([-1]\).

   - **`func_3`:**
     - This function is incomplete and does not perform any operation.
     - It is supposed to use the results from `func_2` to compute the final answer, but it is not implemented.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program is incomplete and contains logical errors in `func_2`.
   - The function `func_3` is not implemented, which is crucial for solving the problem.
   - The logic in `func_2` does not correctly identify the maximum subarray sum, which is essential for the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect and incomplete. It does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
