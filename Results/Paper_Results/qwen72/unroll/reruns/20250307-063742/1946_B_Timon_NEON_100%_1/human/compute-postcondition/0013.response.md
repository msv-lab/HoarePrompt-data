The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each integer `arr[i]` is constrained by -10^9 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr). The function returns a list `total_max_segment` that contains three elements: the sum of all positive numbers in `arr`, the index of the last positive number in `arr`, and the value of `len(arr) - 1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a list `total_max_segment` containing the sum of all positive numbers in `arr`, the index of the last positive number in `arr`, and the length of `arr` minus one.**
