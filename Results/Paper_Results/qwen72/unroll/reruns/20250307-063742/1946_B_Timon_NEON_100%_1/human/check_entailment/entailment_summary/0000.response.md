### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function takes an integer `number` and returns the remainder when `number` is divided by \(10^9 + 7\). This is used to ensure the final answer is within the required range.
   - **func_2**: This function is intended to find the maximum segment of non-negative numbers in the array `arr`. It returns a list containing the sum of this segment, the starting index, and the ending index. If no non-negative segment is found, it returns a list with a single element `-1`.
   - **func_3**: This function is not used in the provided code and always returns 0. It can be ignored for the correctness check.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program is to find the maximum segment of non-negative numbers using `func_2`.
   - If the maximum segment is negative (i.e., no non-negative segment is found), it sets the maximum segment sum to 0.
   - The final answer is calculated as `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`, which is then passed to `func_1` to get the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Issues**:
   - **func_2**: The function `func_2` is designed to find the maximum segment of non-negative numbers, but it does not correctly handle the case where the entire array is negative. It should return the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray, not just non-negative segments.
   - **Main Logic**: The logic for calculating the final answer is incorrect. The formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` does not accurately reflect the problem's requirement to maximize the sum after `k` operations. The correct approach should be to find the maximum subarray sum and then use it to calculate the final sum after `k` operations.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm.
   - The maximum possible sum after `k` operations is the sum of the original array plus the maximum subarray sum multiplied by \(2^k - 1\).
   - This is because each operation can potentially double the maximum subarray sum and add it to the array.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because `func_2` does not correctly find the maximum subarray sum, and the main logic for calculating the final answer is flawed. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
