### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function correctly computes the remainder of a number when divided by \(10^9 + 7\). It is used to ensure the final answer is within the required range.
     - **State**: `number` is an integer.
     - **Output**: The remainder of `number` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - **State**: `arr` is a list of integers where \(-10^9 \le arr[i] \le 10^9\) for all \(0 \le i < len(arr)\).
     - **Logic**:
       - The function initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` to track the current segment and the maximum segment found so far.
       - It iterates through the array, updating `new_segment` and `max_segment` based on the sign of the current element.
       - After the loop, it appends the final segments to `segments_variants`.
       - It then finds the maximum segment from `segments_variants`.
     - **Flaws**:
       - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers. In such cases, the maximum segment sum should be 0 (since an empty subarray has a sum of 0).
       - The function appends `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` even if they are not valid segments (e.g., `new_segment` is empty).
       - The function returns a list `total_max_segment` that contains the sum of the maximum segment and its indices, but the indices are not used in the main logic.

   - **Main Logic**:
     - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
     - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.
     - It calls `func_2(a)` to find the maximum segment sum.
     - If the maximum segment sum is \(-1\), it sets it to 0.
     - It computes the final answer as `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - **Flaws**:
       - The formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `max_segment[0] * (2 ** k - 1) + sum(a)`.
       - The function `func_3` is not used and is incomplete, which is irrelevant to the problem.

3. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - However, the logic in `func_2` and the main computation of the answer are flawed, as noted above.

4. **Final Evaluation**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers.
   - The formula used to compute the final answer is incorrect.
   - The function `func_3` is not implemented and is not needed for the problem.

### Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect due to the flaws in `func_2` and the incorrect formula used to compute the final answer. These issues prevent the program from correctly solving the problem for all potential cases.
