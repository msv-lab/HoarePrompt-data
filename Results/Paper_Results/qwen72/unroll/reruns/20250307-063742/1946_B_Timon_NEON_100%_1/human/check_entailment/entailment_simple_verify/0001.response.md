### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, summing its elements, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
   - `func_1` is a simple function that returns the modulo of a number.
   - `func_2` is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
   - `func_3` is incomplete and does not perform any operation.

3. **Function Analysis:**

   - **`func_1`:**
     - This function correctly computes the modulo of a number with \(10^9 + 7\).
     - It is a straightforward and correct implementation for the given task.

   - **`func_2`:**
     - This function aims to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - The logic is flawed:
       - The function initializes `max_segment` and `new_segment` as lists with a single element.
       - It iterates through the array and updates `new_segment` and `max_segment` based on the current element.
       - However, the way it handles negative and positive elements is incorrect. It does not correctly identify the maximum subarray sum.
       - The function appends segments to `segments_variants` but does not handle the case where the array ends with a positive segment correctly.
       - The final loop to find the maximum segment is also flawed because it does not handle the case where `total_max_segment` is initialized to \([-1]\).

   - **`func_3`:**
     - This function is incomplete and does not perform any operation.
     - It is supposed to use the results from `func_2` to compute the final answer, but it is not implemented.

4. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_2` to find the maximum segment sum.
   - If the maximum segment sum is \(-1\), it sets it to \(0\).
   - It calculates the final answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - It prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Issues in the Main Program:**
   - The formula used to calculate the final answer is incorrect. The logic should be to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, which involves selecting the subarray with the maximum sum and inserting its sum `k` times.
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly identify the maximum subarray sum, leading to incorrect results.
   - The function `func_3` is not used and is incomplete, which is a significant issue as it is supposed to be part of the solution.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect and incomplete. It does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_2` is flawed in its logic for finding the maximum subarray sum, and the function `func_3` is not implemented, which is crucial for the solution.

Final: **False**
