Output State: **`new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [sum of all positive numbers in `arr`, index of the last positive number in `arr`], `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment of positive numbers and the start and end indices of that segment, with an additional list `[sum of all positive numbers in `arr`, index of the last positive number in `arr`, len(arr) - 1]` appended to it, `max_sum` is -1.**

Explanation: The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list is created by extending `max_segment` with the value `len(arr) - 1`. The values of `new_segment` and `max_sum` remain unchanged.
