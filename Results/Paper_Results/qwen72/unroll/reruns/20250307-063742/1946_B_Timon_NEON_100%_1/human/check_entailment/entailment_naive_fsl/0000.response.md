Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is incomplete and does not fully implement the required functionality to solve the problem. Specifically, `func_3` is not implemented, and the program does not handle the logic for performing the k operations to maximize the sum of the array. Additionally, the logic in `func_2` for finding the maximum segment sum is flawed and does not correctly handle all edge cases, such as when the array contains only negative numbers or when the array is empty. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
