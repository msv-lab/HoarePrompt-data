To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` has at least one element, and `i` will start at 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr)
- `new_segment` is an empty list
- `max_segment` is [0, 0]
- `segments_variants` is an empty list
- `max_sum` is -1

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `arr` is not empty, and `i` will start at 0.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1**
