Output State: **`new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [sum of all positive numbers in `arr`, index of the last positive number in `arr`], `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment of positive numbers and the start and end indices of that segment, with an additional list `[sum of all positive numbers in `arr`, index of the last positive number in `arr`, len(arr) - 1]` appended to it, and now an additional list `[len(arr) - 1]` is appended to `segments_variants`. `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is [sum of all positive numbers in `arr`, index of the last positive number in `arr`, len(arr) - 1].**
