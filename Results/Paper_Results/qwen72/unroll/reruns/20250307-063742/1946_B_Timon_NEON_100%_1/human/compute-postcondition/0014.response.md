Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a list `total_max_segment` that contains the sum of the maximum segment of non-negative numbers in `arr`, the starting index of this segment, and the ending index of this segment. If no non-negative numbers are present in `arr`, the function returns a list with a single element `-1`. **
