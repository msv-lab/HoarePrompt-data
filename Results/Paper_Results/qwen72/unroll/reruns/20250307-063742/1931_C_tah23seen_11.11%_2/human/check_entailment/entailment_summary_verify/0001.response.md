### Reasoning:

1. **Palindrome Check:**
   - The initial loop in `func_1` correctly checks if the array is a palindrome by moving the pointers inward. If the array is a palindrome, it returns 0, which is correct because no operation is needed to make all elements equal.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program then breaks out of the loop when it finds the first pair of elements that are not equal. This is a valid step to identify the mismatch.
   - The subsequent logic is flawed. The program assumes that the cost is always \( j - i + 1 \) if \( j \) is not the last index. This is incorrect because the minimum cost to make all elements equal might involve a different approach.
   - The program does not consider the most frequent element in the array, which is a crucial part of the correct solution. The optimal cost to make all elements equal is often achieved by assigning the most frequent element to the entire array or a subarray.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the array is already uniform (all elements are the same) correctly. It should return 0 in such cases.
   - It also does not handle cases where the array can be made uniform by a single operation optimally. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 2, 2, 1], the program will return 3, but the correct answer is 2 (by assigning 2 to the subarray [1, 2, 1]).

### Correct Approach:
- To find the minimum cost, we need to consider the following:
  - If the array is already uniform, the cost is 0.
  - Otherwise, we need to find the most frequent element in the array and determine the minimum cost to make all elements equal to this most frequent element.
  - The cost can be calculated by either:
    - Assigning the most frequent element to the entire array.
    - Or, finding the smallest subarray that, when assigned the most frequent element, will make the entire array uniform.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle all cases and does not compute the minimum cost accurately. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
