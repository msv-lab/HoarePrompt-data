Output State: **`i` is greater than `j` or `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`. During each iteration, if the elements at the current indices `i` and `j` are equal, both `i` and `j` are moved towards the center of the list (i.e., `i` is incremented and `j` is decremented). If at any point the elements at `i` and `j` are not equal, the loop breaks immediately. Therefore, after the loop finishes, either `i` will be greater than `j` (indicating that the loop has successfully checked all corresponding pairs of elements from the start and end of the list), or `arr[i]` will not be equal to `arr[j]` (indicating that a mismatch was found and the loop terminated early).
