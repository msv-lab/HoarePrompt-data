Output State: **`i` is incremented to the point where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or `i` is equal to `j`.**

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This means that `i` will keep increasing until either the current element `arr[i]` is different from the next element `arr[i + 1]`, or `i` reaches the value of `j` (since `i` cannot be greater than `j` according to the initial state). The value of `j` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution.
