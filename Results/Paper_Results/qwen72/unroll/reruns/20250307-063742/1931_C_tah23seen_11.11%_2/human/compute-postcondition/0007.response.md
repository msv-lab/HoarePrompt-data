To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`. The program state right before the loop is given as:

- `i` is greater than or equal to `j` or `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`.
- `i` is not greater than `j`.

From this, we can infer that `i` is less than or equal to `j`. However, the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` is what determines whether the loop will execute. The state `arr[i] is not equal to arr[j]` does not directly affect the loop condition, so we can ignore it for this purpose.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state so that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

State: **`i` is less than or equal to `j`, and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`**
