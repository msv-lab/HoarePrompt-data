Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal using a single operation that assigns a value to a subarray of indices `[i, j]` at a cost of `(j - i + 1) burles`.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.
   - It then calls `func_1(arr)` to compute the minimum cost.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - **Palindrome Check:**
     - The function first checks if the array is a palindrome by comparing elements from the start and end, moving towards the center.
     - If the array is a palindrome, it returns `0` because no operation is needed.
   - **Finding the First Mismatch:**
     - If the array is not a palindrome, it finds the first index `i` where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
   - **Handling the Last Element:**
     - If `j` is not the last index of the array, it returns `j - i + 1`.
     - If `j` is the last index of the array, it returns `j - i`.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Palindrome Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies if the array is a palindrome and returns `0` if it is.
   - This part is correct.

2. **Finding the First Mismatch:**
   - The program finds the first mismatched element correctly.
   - However, it only increments `i` until `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, which may not be the optimal way to find the minimum cost.

3. **Handling the Last Element:**
   - The program returns `j - i + 1` if `j` is not the last index, which is correct.
   - If `j` is the last index, it returns `j - i`, which is incorrect. The correct cost should be `j - i + 1` because the operation cost is inclusive of both `i` and `j`.

### Correctness:

- The program does not handle the case where `j` is the last index of the array correctly. It should always return `j - i + 1` to account for the inclusive cost of the operation.
- Additionally, the logic for finding the first mismatch and the subsequent cost calculation may not always yield the minimum cost. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the program will return `4` (which is correct), but for `[1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]`, it will return `0` (which is correct), but for `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, it will return `5` (which is incorrect; the correct answer should be `6`).

### Conclusion:

The program has logical issues that may lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
