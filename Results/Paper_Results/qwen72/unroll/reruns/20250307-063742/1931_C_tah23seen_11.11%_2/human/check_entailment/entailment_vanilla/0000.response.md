Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation.
- The operation involves selecting three integers \( i \), \( j \), and \( x \) (where \( 1 \le i \le j \le n \)) and assigning all elements from index \( i \) to \( j \) the value \( x \).
- The cost of this operation is \( (j - i + 1) \) burles.
- We need to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \( n \) and the array elements.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to compute the minimum cost and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It initializes two pointers \( i \) and \( j \) to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It enters a loop to check if the elements at the pointers are equal. If they are, it moves the pointers inward.
   - If the pointers cross each other (i.e., \( i > j \)), it means the array is already a palindrome, and the cost is 0.
   - If the elements at the pointers are not equal, it breaks out of the loop.
   - It then enters another loop to find the first index \( i \) where the element is not equal to the next element.
   - If \( j \) is not the last index of the array, it returns \( j - i + 1 \).
   - Otherwise, it returns \( j - i \).

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Palindrome Check:**
   - The initial loop correctly checks if the array is a palindrome and returns 0 if it is.
   - However, the logic for finding the first non-equal element and the subsequent cost calculation is flawed.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program assumes that the cost is always \( j - i + 1 \) if \( j \) is not the last index.
   - This is incorrect because the minimum cost to make all elements equal might involve a different approach.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the array is already uniform (all elements are the same) correctly.
   - It also does not handle cases where the array can be made uniform by a single operation optimally.

### Correct Approach:
- To find the minimum cost, we need to consider the following:
  - If the array is already uniform, the cost is 0.
  - Otherwise, we need to find the most frequent element in the array and determine the minimum cost to make all elements equal to this most frequent element.
  - The cost can be calculated by either:
    - Assigning the most frequent element to the entire array.
    - Or, finding the smallest subarray that, when assigned the most frequent element, will make the entire array uniform.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle all cases and does not compute the minimum cost accurately. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
