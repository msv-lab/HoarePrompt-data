The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the length of the longest contiguous subarray where all elements are the same, starting from the first mismatched element or 0 if the array is a palindrome. Specifically, it returns 0 if the array is a palindrome (i.e., all elements are symmetrically equal), the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1 if `j` is not the last index of `arr` and the elements from `i` to `j` are the same, or the difference between `j` and `i` if `j` is the last index of `arr` and the elements from `i` to `j` are the same.
