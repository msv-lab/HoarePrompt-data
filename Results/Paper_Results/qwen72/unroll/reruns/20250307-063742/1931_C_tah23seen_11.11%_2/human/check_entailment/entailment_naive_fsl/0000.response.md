Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Actual Output:
```
2
```

Explanation of the failure:
- The array is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`.
- The program should return the minimum number of burles required to make all elements equal. In this case, the optimal solution is to select `i = 1`, `j = 3`, and `x = 2`, which will make the array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 1]` and then select `i = 4`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2`, which will make the array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. The total cost is `(3 - 1 + 1) + (4 - 4 + 1) = 3 + 1 = 4` burles.
- However, the program returns `2`, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function, where it does not correctly identify the minimum cost to make all elements equal. The program only checks the first and last elements and their immediate neighbors, which is not sufficient to handle all cases.
