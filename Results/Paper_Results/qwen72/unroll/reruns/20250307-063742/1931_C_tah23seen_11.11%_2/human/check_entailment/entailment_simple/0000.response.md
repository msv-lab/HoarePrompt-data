### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.
   - The program then calls `func_1(arr)` to determine the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then enters a loop to find the largest subarray where the elements at the start and end are equal. This is done by incrementing `i` and decrementing `j` until `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`.
   - If `i` becomes greater than `j`, it means the entire array is already equal, and the function returns 0.
   - If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`, it increments `i` to skip over consecutive equal elements.
   - If `j` is not the last index of the array, the function returns the length of the subarray from `i` to `j` (inclusive), which is `j - i + 1`.
   - If `j` is the last index of the array, the function returns the length of the subarray from `i` to `j` (exclusive), which is `j - i`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the array is already equal, the function correctly returns 0.
   - If the array has only one element, the function correctly returns 0.
   - If the array has two elements and they are different, the function correctly returns 1.
   - If the array has more than two elements and the elements at the start and end are different, the function correctly calculates the minimum cost to make the array equal.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The function correctly identifies the subarray that needs to be modified to make the entire array equal.
   - The cost calculation is based on the length of the subarray, which is correct according to the problem statement.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic:

- **Issue with Consecutive Equal Elements:**
  - The loop `while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]: i += 1` only checks for consecutive equal elements starting from `i`. It does not handle the case where there are consecutive equal elements starting from `j` towards the end of the array. This could lead to incorrect results if the array has a pattern like `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1]`.

### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where there are consecutive equal elements starting from the end of the array. This can lead to an incorrect minimum cost being calculated. To fix this, the program should also check for consecutive equal elements starting from `j` and decrement `j` accordingly.
