The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each element in the list is between 1 and the length of the list.

- **Case_1**: The function returns 0.
- **Case_2**: The function returns the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1, where `i` is the index at which `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is equal to `j`, and `j` is an index that is not the last index of `arr`.
- **Case_3**: The function returns the difference between `j` and `i`, where `j` is the last index of the list (`len(arr) - 1`) and `i` is the index where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or `i` is equal to `j`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the length of the longest contiguous subarray where all elements are the same, or 0 if the entire array is not contiguous with the same elements.**
