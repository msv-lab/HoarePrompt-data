You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr).
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `i` is greater than `j` or `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: `i` is greater than or equal to `j` or `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`. `i` is not greater than `j`.
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is incremented to the point where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or `i` is equal to `j`.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1, where `i` is the index at which `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is equal to `j`, and `j` is an index that is not the last index of `arr`.
    #State: *`i` is incremented to the point where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or `i` is equal to `j`. Additionally, `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
    return j - i
    #The program returns the difference between `j` and `i`, where `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` and `i` is the index where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or `i` is equal to `j`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the length of the longest contiguous subarray where all elements are the same, or 0 if the entire array is not contiguous with the same elements.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1, where `i` is the index at which `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is equal to `j`, and `j` is an index that is not the last index of `arr`.

Case_3: The program returns the difference between `j` and `i`, where `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` and `i` is the index where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or `i` is equal to `j`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
