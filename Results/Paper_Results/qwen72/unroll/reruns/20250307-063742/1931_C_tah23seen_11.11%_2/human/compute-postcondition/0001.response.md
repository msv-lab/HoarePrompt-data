Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `j` is len(arr) - 1.**

The variable `j` is assigned the value of the length of `arr` minus 1. The length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, so `j` will be between 0 and 2 * 10^5 - 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
