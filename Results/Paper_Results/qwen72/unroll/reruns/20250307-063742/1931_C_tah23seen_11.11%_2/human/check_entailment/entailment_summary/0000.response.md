Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal by selecting a subarray and assigning a value to all elements within that subarray. The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray.

The provided function `func_1` attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Checking if the array is a palindrome (i.e., symmetrically equal). If it is, the function returns 0 because no operation is needed.
2. If the array is not a palindrome, it finds the first and last positions where the elements differ.
3. It then checks if the elements from the first mismatched position to the last mismatched position are the same.
4. Based on these conditions, it returns the length of the subarray that needs to be modified.

However, the function has a few issues:
1. It does not correctly handle the case where the array is not a palindrome and the elements from the first mismatched position to the last mismatched position are not the same. In such cases, the function should return the length of the subarray from the first mismatched position to the last mismatched position, but it does not.
2. The function does not consider the case where the array has only one unique element, which should return 0.
3. The function does not correctly handle the case where the array has multiple unique elements and the cost should be the length of the entire array minus the length of the longest subarray of the same element.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should:
1. Identify the most frequent element in the array.
2. Calculate the cost of making all elements equal to this most frequent element by replacing all other elements.
3. Return the minimum cost.

Given the issues in the provided function, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
