The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `j`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i <= j`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.

Given that `1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5`, the minimum value of `len(arr)` is 1. Therefore, the minimum value of `j` is `0` (when `len(arr) = 1`). Since `i` is 0, the condition `i <= j` will always be true for the first iteration, regardless of the length of `arr`.

No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `j` is len(arr) - 1**
