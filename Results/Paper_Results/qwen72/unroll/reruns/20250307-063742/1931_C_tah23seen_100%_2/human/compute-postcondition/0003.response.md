To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `i < len(arr) - 1`**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `len(arr)` is the length of the array, which is `n`.
   - Therefore, the condition `i < len(arr) - 1` simplifies to `0 < n - 1`.
   - Since `n` is the length of `arr` and `1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5`, `n` must be at least 2 for `0 < n - 1` to be true.

2. **Condition 2: `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `arr[i]` is the first element of the array.
   - `arr[i + 1]` is the second element of the array.
   - For the loop to execute, the first element of the array must be equal to the second element of the array.

### Conclusion:
- The length of `arr` (which is `n`) must be at least 2 for the loop to potentially execute.
- The first element of `arr` must be equal to the second element of `arr` for the loop to actually execute.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where `1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5`.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is the length of `arr`.
- `j` is `n - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `n` is the length of `arr` and must be at least 2; `j` is `n - 1`; `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`**
