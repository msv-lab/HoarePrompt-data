Output State: **The program returns the maximum of 0 and (j - i - 1), where `j` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or 0 if all elements are equal, and `i` remains the same.**

In natural language, the program returns the maximum of 0 and the difference between `j` and `i` minus 1. `j` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is different from its next element, or 0 if all elements in `arr` are the same. `i` remains unchanged from its initial value. If the difference between `j` and `i` minus 1 is negative, the program returns 0.
