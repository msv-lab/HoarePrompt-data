### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary provided.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation. The operation involves selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a chosen value \( x \). The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray, \( j - i + 1 \).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \( n \) and the array itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the array and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It moves the pointer `i` to the right as long as the current element and the next element are the same.
   - It moves the pointer `j` to the left as long as the current element and the previous element are the same.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it returns the length of the subarray between `i` and `j` (excluding the endpoints), which is `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the minimum of the lengths of the subarrays from `i` to the end and from the start to `j`, which is `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

#### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Case 1: All elements are already equal.**
   - If all elements are the same, the function should return 0 because no operation is needed.
   - The function correctly handles this case by checking if `arr[0] == arr[-1]` and returning 0 if true.

2. **Case 2: The array has a segment of equal elements at the start or end.**
   - The function correctly identifies the longest segment of equal elements at the start and end by moving the pointers `i` and `j`.
   - If the first and last elements are the same, it returns the length of the subarray between `i` and `j` (excluding the endpoints), which is the correct cost to make the entire array equal by setting the middle segment to the same value.

3. **Case 3: The array does not have a segment of equal elements at the start or end.**
   - The function returns the minimum of the lengths of the subarrays from `i` to the end and from the start to `j`.
   - This is the correct approach because the minimum of these two lengths will be the smallest subarray that needs to be set to a value to make the entire array equal.

#### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array:**
  - If the array has only one element, the function correctly returns 0.
- **Two Element Array:**
  - If the array has two elements and they are different, the function correctly returns 1.
- **Array with All Different Elements:**
  - If all elements are different, the function correctly returns the length of the array minus 1, which is the minimum cost to set all elements to the same value.

#### Function Summary Verification:
The function summary states that `func_1` returns the length of the longest subarray of consecutive equal elements, excluding the first and last elements if they are the same. If all elements in the list are equal, it returns 0. If the first and last elements are different, it returns the length of the subarray from the first non-equal element to the last non-equal element, or 0 if no such subarray exists.

- **All Elements Equal:**
  - The function returns 0, which is correct.
- **First and Last Elements Equal:**
  - The function returns the length of the subarray between `i` and `j` (excluding the endpoints), which is correct.
- **First and Last Elements Different:**
  - The function returns the minimum of the lengths of the subarrays from `i` to the end and from the start to `j`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases and edge cases as described in the problem. The function `func_1` is implemented correctly according to the function summary and the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
