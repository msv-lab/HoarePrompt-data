Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` is intended to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal, but it has some logical flaws:

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array is already uniform (all elements are the same), returning 0 burles.
   - However, it does not handle the case where the array can be made uniform by selecting a subarray that is not at the beginning or end of the array.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` only checks for the longest prefix and suffix where all elements are the same. It then calculates the minimum burles based on these indices, which is not always correct.
   - For example, consider the array `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`. The program will return 2 burles, but the correct answer is 3 burles (by selecting the subarray from index 4 to 5 and setting it to 8).

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, you need to find the most frequent element in the array and then determine the minimum cost to make all elements equal to this most frequent element. This involves checking the cost of making the entire array equal to each unique element and selecting the minimum cost.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(min_burles(arr))
    t -= 1

def min_burles(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    if all(x == arr[0] for x in arr):
        return 0
    
    # Find the most frequent element
    from collections import Counter
    freq = Counter(arr)
    most_common_element, _ = freq.most_common(1)[0]
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal to the most frequent element
    cost = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] != most_common_element:
            cost += 1
    
    return cost
```

This version correctly calculates the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal by finding the most frequent element and then counting the number of elements that need to be changed to this most frequent element.
