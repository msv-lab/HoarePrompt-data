The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the length of the longest subarray of consecutive equal elements, excluding the first and last elements if they are the same. If all elements in the list are equal, it returns 0. If the first and last elements are different, it returns the length of the subarray from the first non-equal element to the last non-equal element, or 0 if no such subarray exists.
