Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation. The operation involves selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a chosen value \( x \). The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray, \( j - i + 1 \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \( n \) and the array itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the array and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It moves the pointer `i` to the right as long as the current element and the next element are the same.
   - It moves the pointer `j` to the left as long as the current element and the previous element are the same.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it returns the length of the subarray between `i` and `j` (excluding the endpoints), which is `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the minimum of the lengths of the subarrays from `i` to the end and from the start to `j`, which is `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Case 1: All elements are already equal.**
   - If all elements are the same, the function should return 0 because no operation is needed.
   - The function correctly handles this case by checking if `arr[0] == arr[-1]` and returning 0 if true.

2. **Case 2: The array has a segment of equal elements at the start or end.**
   - The function correctly identifies the longest segment of equal elements at the start and end by moving the pointers `i` and `j`.
   - If the first and last elements are the same, it returns the length of the subarray between `i` and `j` (excluding the endpoints), which is the correct cost to make the entire array equal by setting the middle segment to the same value.

3. **Case 3: The array does not have a segment of equal elements at the start or end.**
   - The function returns the minimum of the lengths of the subarrays from `i` to the end and from the start to `j`.
   - This is the correct approach because the minimum of these two lengths will be the smallest subarray that needs to be set to a value to make the entire array equal.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array:**
  - If the array has only one element, the function correctly returns 0.
- **Two Element Array:**
  - If the array has two elements and they are different, the function correctly returns 1.
- **Array with All Different Elements:**
  - If all elements are different, the function correctly returns the length of the array minus 1, which is the minimum cost to set all elements to the same value.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases and edge cases as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
