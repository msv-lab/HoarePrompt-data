You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

    #State: *`i` remains the same, and `j` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `0` if all elements are equal. Additionally, the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`.
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation. The operation involves selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a chosen value \( x \). The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray, \( j - i + 1 \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \( n \) and the array itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the array and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It moves the pointer `i` to the right as long as the current element and the next element are the same.
   - It moves the pointer `j` to the left as long as the current element and the previous element are the same.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it returns the length of the subarray between `i` and `j` (excluding the endpoints), which is `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the minimum of the lengths of the subarrays from `i` to the end and from the start to `j`, which is `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Case 1: All elements are already equal.**
   - If all elements are the same, the function should return 0 because no operation is needed.
   - The function correctly handles this case by checking if `arr[0] == arr[-1]` and returning 0 if true.

2. **Case 2: The array has a segment of equal elements at the start or end.**
   - The function correctly identifies the longest segment of equal elements at the start and end by moving the pointers `i` and `j`.
   - If the first and last elements are the same, it returns the length of the subarray between `i` and `j` (excluding the endpoints), which is the correct cost to make the entire array equal by setting the middle segment to the same value.

3. **Case 3: The array does not have a segment of equal elements at the start or end.**
   - The function returns the minimum of the lengths of the subarrays from `i` to the end and from the start to `j`.
   - This is the correct approach because the minimum of these two lengths will be the smallest subarray that needs to be set to a value to make the entire array equal.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array:**
  - If the array has only one element, the function correctly returns 0.
- **Two Element Array:**
  - If the array has two elements and they are different, the function correctly returns 1.
- **Array with All Different Elements:**
  - If all elements are different, the function correctly returns the length of the array minus 1, which is the minimum cost to set all elements to the same value.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases and edge cases as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
