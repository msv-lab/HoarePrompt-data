The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each element in `arr` is an integer between 1 and the length of `arr`. The function returns a value based on the following cases:

- **Case_1:** If there is a first index `j` where the element at `j` is not equal to the element at `j + 1`, the function returns the maximum of 0 and (j - i - 1), where `i` is the starting index (0 by default). If all elements in `arr` are equal, the function returns 0.
- **Case_2:** If there is a first index `j` where the element at `j` is not equal to the element at `j + 1`, the function returns the maximum value between 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and `j`, where `n` is the length of `arr` and `i` is the starting index (0 by default). If all elements in `arr` are equal, the function returns 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the maximum of 0 and (j - i - 1) if the first non-equal consecutive elements are found at index `j` and `i` is the starting index. If all elements are equal, it returns 0. Alternatively, it returns the maximum value between 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and `j`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. If all elements are equal, it also returns 0.**
