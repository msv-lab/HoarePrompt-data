Output State: **`i` remains the same, and `j` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `0` if all elements are equal.**

Natural Language Explanation: The loop starts with `j` set to `n - 1` and decrements `j` as long as the current element `arr[j]` is equal to the previous element `arr[j - 1]`. This continues until `j` reaches an index where `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[j - 1]`, or until `j` becomes `0` if all elements are equal. The value of `i` is not affected by the loop and remains the same as it was in the initial state.
