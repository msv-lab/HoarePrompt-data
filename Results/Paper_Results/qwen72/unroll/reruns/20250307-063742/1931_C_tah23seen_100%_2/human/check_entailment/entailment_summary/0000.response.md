Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal by selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a chosen value. The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray (j - i + 1). The program's `func_1` function is designed to find this minimum cost.

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The function first checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). This is done by comparing the first and last elements after trimming any leading or trailing sequences of the same element.
   - If the first and last elements are the same, the function returns the length of the middle subarray that needs to be set to the same value. This is calculated as `max(j - i - 1, 0)`, which ensures that if the entire array is uniform, the cost is 0.

2. **Finding the Subarray**:
   - The function then trims the array from the beginning and the end to find the first and last positions where the elements differ from the first and last elements, respectively.
   - If the first and last elements are different, the function returns the minimum of the lengths of the subarrays from the first non-equal element to the end (`n - i - 1`) and from the beginning to the last non-equal element (`j`).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array has only one element, the function correctly returns 0 because no operation is needed.
   - If the array has two elements and they are different, the function returns 1, which is the correct cost to set one of the elements to the other.

However, the function's logic for finding the minimum cost is flawed. It does not consider the optimal subarray to set all elements to the same value. The correct approach should be to find the most frequent element in the array and calculate the cost to set the entire array to that element, or to find the smallest subarray that, when set to a single value, makes the entire array uniform.

The provided function does not correctly handle cases where the most frequent element is not at the beginning or end of the array. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, the function will return 3, but the correct answer is 2 (by setting the middle three elements to 2).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
