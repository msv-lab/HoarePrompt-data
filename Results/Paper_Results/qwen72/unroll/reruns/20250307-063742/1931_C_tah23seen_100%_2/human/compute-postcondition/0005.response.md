To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to consider the conditions in the loop head: `j > 0` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.

1. **Condition `j > 0`:** This condition must be true for the loop to start. Given that `j` remains `n - 1`, we need to ensure that `n - 1 > 0`, which means `n` must be greater than 1.
2. **Condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`:** This condition checks if the last element of the array is equal to the second-to-last element. For the loop to execute, this condition must be true. However, we don't have information about the contents of `arr` in the given state. We can assume that `arr` must be such that the last element is equal to the second-to-last element.

Given the state before the loop:
- `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal.
- `j` remains `n - 1`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`.

Since we cannot modify `arr` directly, we can only ensure that `n` is greater than 1 and that `j` is greater than 0. The condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` must be true, but we cannot modify `arr` to ensure this. Therefore, we can only state the necessary condition for `n`.

State: **`i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal, `j` remains `n - 1` and `n` must be greater than 1**.
