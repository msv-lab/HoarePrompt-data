### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.
   - It initializes `i` to 0 and `j` to `len(arr) - 1`.
   - The first `while` loop increments `i` until it finds the first element that is not equal to its next element. This loop ensures that `i` is the index of the first element that is different from the elements to its right.
   - The second `while` loop decrements `j` until it finds the first element that is not equal to its previous element. This loop ensures that `j` is the index of the first element that is different from the elements to its left.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are equal (`arr[0] == arr[-1]`), the function returns the maximum of 0 and `(j - i - 1)`. This is because if the first and last elements are equal, the array can be made equal by changing the elements between `i` and `j` (exclusive).
   - If the first and last elements are not equal, the function returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of `(n - i - 1)` and `j`. This is because the minimum cost to make the array equal is the minimum of the cost to change the elements from `i` to the end of the array or from the start of the array to `j`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all elements in the array are already equal, the `while` loops will set `i` to `len(arr) - 1` and `j` to 0, and the function will return 0, which is correct.
   - If the array has only one element, the function will return 0, which is correct.
   - If the array has two elements and they are not equal, the function will return 1, which is correct.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the segments of the array that need to be changed to make all elements equal.
   - It calculates the minimum cost by considering the cost of changing the elements from `i` to the end or from the start to `j`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
