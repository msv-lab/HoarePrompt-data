Output State: **`i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal. `j` remains `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The loop increments `i` until it finds an element in `arr` that is not equal to the next element. If all elements in the list are the same, `i` will eventually reach `len(arr) - 1`, which is the last index of the list. The variable `j` is not modified within the loop, so it remains `n - 1`.
