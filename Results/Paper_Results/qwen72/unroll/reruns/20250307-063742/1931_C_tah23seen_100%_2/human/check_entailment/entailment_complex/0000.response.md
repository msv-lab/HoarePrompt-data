### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the array `arr` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `i` is initialized to 0, which is the starting index of the array.
     - `n` is the length of the array.
     - `j` is initialized to `n - 1`, which is the last index of the array.
   
   - **Finding the First Non-Equal Element from the Start**:
     - The first `while` loop increments `i` until it finds the first element that is not equal to its next element. If all elements are equal, `i` will be `n - 1`.
     - This ensures that `i` is the index of the first element that is not equal to its next element or `n - 1` if all elements are equal.
   
   - **Finding the First Non-Equal Element from the End**:
     - The second `while` loop decrements `j` until it finds the first element that is not equal to its previous element. If all elements are equal, `j` will be 0.
     - This ensures that `j` is the index of the first element that is not equal to its previous element or 0 if all elements are equal.
   
   - **Case 1: All Elements are Equal**:
     - If `arr[0] == arr[-1]`, it means the array is either all equal or the first and last elements are the same.
     - The function returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`, which is 0 if all elements are equal (since `i` and `j` will be the same or adjacent).
   
   - **Case 2: First and Last Elements are Different**:
     - If `arr[0] != arr[-1]`, the function returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.
     - `n - i - 1` is the length of the subarray from the first non-equal element to the end.
     - `j` is the length of the subarray from the start to the last non-equal element.
     - The function returns the minimum of these two lengths, ensuring the smallest subarray that needs to be modified to make all elements equal.

3. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the problem by finding the minimum subarray that needs to be modified to make all elements equal. The logic is sound and the states of `i` and `j` are correctly managed to ensure the correct output for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
