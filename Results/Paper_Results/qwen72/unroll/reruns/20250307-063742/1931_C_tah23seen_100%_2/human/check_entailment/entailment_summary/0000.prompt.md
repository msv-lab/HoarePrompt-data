Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

# Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
    if arr[0] == arr[-1]:
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the length of the longest subarray of consecutive equal elements, excluding the first and last elements if they are the same. If all elements in the list are equal, it returns 0. If the first and last elements are different, it returns the length of the subarray from the first non-equal element to the last non-equal element, or 0 if no such subarray exists.

Correctness: **True** or **False**
