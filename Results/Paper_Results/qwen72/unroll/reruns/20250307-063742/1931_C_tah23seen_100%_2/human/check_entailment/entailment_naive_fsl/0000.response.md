Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array elements are all different, and the optimal solution involves selecting the most frequent element and changing the rest to that element. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The output of the program is `2`, but the correct output should be `4` because the optimal solution is to change all elements to the most frequent element, which in this case is any of the elements since they all appear once. The cost would be `5 - 1 = 4` burles. The program incorrectly returns `2` because it only considers the edges of the array and does not account for the most frequent element in the array.
