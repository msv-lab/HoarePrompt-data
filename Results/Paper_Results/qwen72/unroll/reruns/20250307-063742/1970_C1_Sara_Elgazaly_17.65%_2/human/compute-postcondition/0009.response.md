The function `func` accepts several parameters: `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and `u_1`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5.
- `t` is an integer and t = 1.
- `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree described by the edges (u, v) has exactly two leaves.
- `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. However, given the constraints and the nature of the parameters, it is likely that the function returns some information related to the tree structure defined by the edges (u, v) and the initial node `u_1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and `u_1`. It returns information related to the tree structure defined by the edges (u, v) and the initial node `u_1`, given that `n` is an integer within the range [2, 2 × 10^5], `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers within the range [1, n] and the tree has exactly two leaves, and `u_1` is an integer within the range [1, n].**
