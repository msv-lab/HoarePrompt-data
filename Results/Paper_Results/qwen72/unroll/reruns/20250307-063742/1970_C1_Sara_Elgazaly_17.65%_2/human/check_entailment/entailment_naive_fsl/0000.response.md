Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the starting node is a leaf. According to the problem description, the tree has exactly two leaves, and the game starts with a stone on one of the nodes. If the starting node is a leaf, the player who starts (Ron) will lose immediately because there are no inactive neighbors to move to. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario and will still proceed with the logic, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
1
```
In this case, the starting node is 1, which is a leaf. Ron cannot make a move and should lose, but the program will not correctly determine this and may output "Ron" instead of "Hermione".
