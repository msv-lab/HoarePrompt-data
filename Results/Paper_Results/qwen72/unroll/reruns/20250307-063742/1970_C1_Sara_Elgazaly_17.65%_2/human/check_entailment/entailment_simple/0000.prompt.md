Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

# Annotated Program:
from collections import defaultdict

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is an integer and t = 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree described by the edges (u, v) has exactly two leaves. The initial node u_1 is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    lst = defaultdict(list)
    for _ in range(x - 1):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        lst[a].append(b)
        
        lst[b].append(a)
        
    #State: The loop modifies the `lst` dictionary by appending `b` to the list of `a` and `a` to the list of `b` for each iteration. After `x - 1` iterations, `lst` will contain `x` edges, and the lists associated with each node will include all the nodes it is connected to. The values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `u_1`, and `y` remain unchanged.
    s = True
    while lst[x] != []:
        while lst[x]:
            y = lst[x].pop()
            if lst[y] != []:
                x = y
                break
        
        s = not s
        
    #State: The `lst` dictionary will have all its lists empty, `x` will be the last node that had a non-empty list before the loop ended, `y` will be the last node popped from `lst[x]`, and `s` will be `False`. The values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and `u_1` remain unchanged.
    s = not s
    print('Hermione' if s else 'Ron')
    #This is printed: Hermione
