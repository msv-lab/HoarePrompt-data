You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Annotated Code: 
from random import randint

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: The loop will execute 1000 times, generating random integers `x`, `y`, and `z` between 1 and 9 for each iteration. For each iteration, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will be printed, followed by the string 'peak' if `x < y` and `y > z`, 'stair' if `x < y` and `y < z`, or 'none' in all other cases. After 1000 iterations, the value of `i` will be 1001, and the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` generates and processes 1000 test cases. For each test case, it generates three random integers `x`, `y`, and `z` between 1 and 9. It then prints these integers, followed by a string: 'peak' if `x < y` and `y > z`, 'stair' if `x < y` and `y < z`, or 'none' in all other cases. After 1000 iterations, the function completes, and the value of `i` will be 1001. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. The state of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remains unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it generates random test cases and prints the results, but it does not handle the input format specified in the problem description, which requires reading an integer `t` for the number of test cases and then processing `t` test cases. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `x`, `y`, and `z` can be 0, as specified in the problem constraints. 

For example, the program would fail to correctly handle the following input:
```
7
1 2 3
3 2 1
1 5 3
3 4 1
0 0 0
4 1 7
4 5 7
```
The program does not read the input in the format specified and does not correctly identify the cases where the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. Specifically, the program would incorrectly classify `3 2 1` as `none` instead of `NONE`, and it would not handle the case `0 0 0` correctly, as it does not consider 0 as a valid digit in its logic.
