The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints, it is implied that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The function is expected to return a result for each test case, but the specific return values or conditions are not provided in the constraints.

Given the lack of explicit parameters and the output details, I can only infer that the function is designed to process a series of test cases involving `a`, `b`, and `c` and return some result based on these inputs. Without further information on the output, I cannot specify the exact return values or conditions.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and returns a result for each test case.**
