The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the condition `i <= 1000`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to 1000, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, which is already less than 1000. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `i` is 1**
