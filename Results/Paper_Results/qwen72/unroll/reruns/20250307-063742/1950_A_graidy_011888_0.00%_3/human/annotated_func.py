#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'

    #State: The loop will execute 1000 times, generating random integers `x`, `y`, and `z` between 1 and 9 for each iteration. For each iteration, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will be printed, followed by the string 'peak' if `x < y` and `y > z`, 'stair' if `x < y` and `y < z`, or 'none' in all other cases. After 1000 iterations, the value of `i` will be 1001, and the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` generates and processes 1000 test cases. For each test case, it generates three random integers `x`, `y`, and `z` between 1 and 9. It then prints these integers, followed by a string: 'peak' if `x < y` and `y > z`, 'stair' if `x < y` and `y < z`, or 'none' in all other cases. After 1000 iterations, the function completes, and the value of `i` will be 1001. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. The state of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remains unchanged.
