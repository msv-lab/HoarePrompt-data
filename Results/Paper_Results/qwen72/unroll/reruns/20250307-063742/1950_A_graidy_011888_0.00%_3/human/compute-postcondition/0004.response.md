Functionality: ** The function `func` generates and processes 1000 test cases. For each test case, it generates three random integers `x`, `y`, and `z` between 1 and 9. It then prints these integers, followed by a string: 'peak' if `x < y` and `y > z`, 'stair' if `x < y` and `y < z`, or 'none' in all other cases. After 1000 iterations, the function completes, and the value of `i` will be 1001. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. The state of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remains unchanged. **
