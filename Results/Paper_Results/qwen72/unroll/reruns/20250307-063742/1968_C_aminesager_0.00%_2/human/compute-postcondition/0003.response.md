The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `x`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, representing the number of elements in the list plus one.
- `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, representing the elements of the list.

The function returns the missing integer from the list `x` for each test case. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `x`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the total number of elements expected in the list (including the missing one), and `x` is a list of `n-1` integers. It returns the missing integer from the list `x` for each test case.**
