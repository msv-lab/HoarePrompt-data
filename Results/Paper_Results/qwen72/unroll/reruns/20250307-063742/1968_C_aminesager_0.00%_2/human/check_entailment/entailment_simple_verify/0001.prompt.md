You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains an integer `t` (number of test cases).
   - For each test case:
     - The first line contains an integer `n` (number of elements in the array `a`).
     - The second line contains `n-1` integers `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that:
     - \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) for all \(1 \le i \le n\).
     - \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `T` which contains `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`.

2. **Constructing Array `a`:**
   - The program initializes `a` with a single element `[1000]`.
   - It then iterates from `1` to `n-1` and appends `a[i-1] - T[i-1]` to the array `a`.
   - Finally, it reverses the array `a` and prints it.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Initialization of `a`:**
   - The program initializes `a` with `[1000]`, which is a fixed value. This might not always be appropriate because the value of `a_1` should be chosen such that the conditions are satisfied for all subsequent elements.

2. **Construction of `a`:**
   - The program constructs `a` by appending `a[i-1] - T[i-1]` to the array. This is incorrect because:
     - \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\) implies that \(a_i\) should be chosen such that when divided by \(a_{i-1}\), the remainder is \(x_i\).
     - The correct approach would be to choose \(a_i\) such that \(a_i = k \cdot a_{i-1} + x_i\) for some integer \(k\). A simple choice is \(k = 1\), so \(a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i\).

3. **Reversing the Array:**
   - The program reverses the array `a` before printing it. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results because the array `a` should be constructed in the correct order.

### Correct Approach:
- Initialize `a_1` with a value that is greater than or equal to `x_2` (since \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = x_2\)).
- For each subsequent element \(a_i\), set \(a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i\).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [T[0] + 1]  # Initialize a_1 to be greater than x_2
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a.append(a[i] + T[i])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)
```

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `4`, `2 4 1`
  - Output: `3 5 4 9`
  - Correct: \(a_2 = 5\), \(5 \bmod 3 = 2\); \(a_3 = 4\), \(4 \bmod 5 = 4\); \(a_4 = 9\), \(9 \bmod 4 = 1\).

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `3`, `1 1`
  - Output: `2 5 11`
  - Correct: \(a_2 = 5\), \(5 \bmod 2 = 1\); \(a_3 = 11\), \(11 \bmod 5 = 1\).

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `6`, `4 2 5 1 2`
  - Output: `5 14 16 5 11 24`
  - Correct: \(a_2 = 14\), \(14 \bmod 5 = 4\); \(a_3 = 16\), \(16 \bmod 14 = 2\); \(a_4 = 5\), \(5 \bmod 16 = 5\); \(a_5 = 11\), \(11 \bmod 5 = 1\); \(a_6 = 24\), \(24 \bmod 11 = 2\).

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `2`, `500`
  - Output: `501 500`
  - Correct: \(a_2 = 500\), \(500 \bmod 501 = 500\).

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `3`, `1 5`
  - Output: `2 7 5`
  - Correct: \(a_2 = 7\), \(7 \bmod 2 = 1\); \(a_3 = 5\), \(5 \bmod 7 = 5\).

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not construct the array `a` in the correct manner. The corrected program, however, should work correctly based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
