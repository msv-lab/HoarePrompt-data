For the loop to execute the first time, the condition in the loop head must be true. The loop head is `while t:`. This means that `t` must be a truthy value for the loop to execute. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy.

Given the program state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500
- `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500
- The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5

Since `t` is already constrained to be an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, it is guaranteed to be a truthy value. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5**
