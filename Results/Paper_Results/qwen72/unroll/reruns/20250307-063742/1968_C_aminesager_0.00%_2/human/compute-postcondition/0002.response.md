Output State: **t is 0, n is the last input integer, x is unchanged, and the last computed list a is printed in reverse order.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` starts with an initial value and is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. After the loop finishes, `t` will be 0.
- The variable `n` is updated in each iteration with the new input value. After the loop finishes, `n` will hold the value of the last input integer.
- The list `x` is not modified within the loop, so it remains unchanged.
- The list `a` is computed in each iteration based on the input list `T` and is printed in reverse order. The final printed list `a` will be the one computed in the last iteration of the loop.
