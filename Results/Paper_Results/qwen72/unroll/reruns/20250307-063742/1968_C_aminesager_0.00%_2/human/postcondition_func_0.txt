The function `func` reads input values for `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers `T`. It then computes a list `a` of `n` integers in reverse order, where each element is derived by subtracting the corresponding element from `T` from the previous element in `a`. The function prints the computed list `a` for each test case. After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, and the list `a` is printed in reverse order. The function does not return any value.
