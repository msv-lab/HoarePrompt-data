You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
        a = a[::-1]
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        line = input('')
        
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        
        a = [1000]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
        
        a = a[::-1]
        
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: t is 0, n is the last input integer, x is unchanged, and the last computed list a is printed in reverse order.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the logic used to construct the array `a` is flawed. The program initializes `a` with a value of 1000 and then tries to construct the array by subtracting the values from `T` from the previous element in `a`. This approach does not ensure that the conditions \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\) are met for all elements.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
2 4 1
```
The program will produce:
```
3 5 4 9
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
3 5 4 9
```
But if we consider another input:
```
1
3
1 5
```
The program will produce:
```
2 7 5
```
This output is incorrect because \(7 \bmod 2 = 1\) (which is correct for \(x_2\)), but \(5 \bmod 7 = 5\) (which is not equal to \(x_3 = 5\)).

The correct approach should involve constructing the array `a` such that each element \(a_i\) is a multiple of \(a_{i-1}\) plus the corresponding \(x_i\). For example, \(a_i = k \cdot a_{i-1} + x_i\) where \(k\) is chosen such that \(a_i\) is within the allowed range (1 to \(10^9\)). The current program does not follow this logic and hence is incorrect.
