### Reasoning:

1. **Heap Initialization**:
   - The function initializes a min-heap with the ticket prices and their corresponding days. This is done using a list comprehension and `heapq.heapify(pq)`.
   - This ensures that the function can always access the cheapest ticket price efficiently.

2. **Heap Operations**:
   - The function uses a while loop to buy tickets until the required number (k) is reached.
   - In each iteration, it pops the smallest price from the heap using `heapq.heappop(pq)`.
   - The price is then increased by the total number of tickets bought so far (`price += price_increase`).
   - The function buys the maximum possible tickets (up to m) or the remaining tickets needed to reach k (`tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)`).
   - The total cost is updated by adding the product of the current price and the number of tickets bought in that iteration (`total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy`).
   - The number of tickets bought and the price increase are updated accordingly (`tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy` and `price_increase += tickets_to_buy`).

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The total cost is calculated by summing the adjusted prices for the tickets bought. This is done correctly by multiplying the current price (after the increase) by the number of tickets bought in each iteration.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when k is less than or equal to m, and when the number of tickets to be bought is large.
   - The heap ensures that the program always buys the cheapest tickets first, and the price increase is correctly applied to subsequent days.

5. **Verification of Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly k tickets under the given constraints.
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the program always selects the cheapest available ticket price, which is crucial for minimizing the total cost.
   - The price increase is correctly applied to subsequent days, ensuring that the constraints of the problem are respected.

6. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases are correctly handled by the program:
     - For the first test case (4 2 3, 8 6 4 2), the program buys 1 ticket on day 3 and 2 tickets on day 4, resulting in a total cost of 10.
     - For the second test case (4 2 8, 8 6 4 2), the program buys 2 tickets on each of the 4 days, resulting in a total cost of 64.
     - For the third test case (5 100 1, 10000 1 100 10 1000), the program buys 1 ticket on the second day, resulting in a total cost of 1.
     - For the fourth test case (6 3 9, 5 5 5 5 5 5), the program buys 3 tickets on each of the 3 days, resulting in a total cost of 72.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It efficiently uses a min-heap to always buy the cheapest available tickets and correctly applies the price increase for subsequent days. The provided test cases are handled correctly, and the logic ensures that the minimum spending is achieved for purchasing exactly k tickets.
