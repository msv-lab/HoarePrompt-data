Output State: **`tickets_bought` is `k`, `total_cost` is the sum of the costs of the first `k` tickets bought, and `price_increase` is the total number of tickets bought (`k`).**

### Explanation:
- **`tickets_bought`**: The loop continues until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `tickets_bought` will be equal to `k`.
- **`total_cost`**: This variable accumulates the total cost of the tickets bought. Each iteration, the loop buys the minimum of `m` tickets or the remaining number of tickets needed to reach `k` (`k - tickets_bought`). The cost of each ticket is the price from the heap plus the `price_increase`. The `total_cost` is the sum of these costs over all iterations.
- **`price_increase`**: This variable increases by the number of tickets bought in each iteration. Since the loop buys exactly `k` tickets in total, `price_increase` will be equal to `k` after the loop finishes.
