Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets over `n` days, given the constraints on the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day (`m`) and the price increase after each purchase. The program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets from the cheapest available day, which is a good strategy to minimize the total cost.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Priority Queue (Min-Heap) Usage**:
   - The program initializes a priority queue with the initial prices and their corresponding days.
   - The priority queue ensures that the cheapest ticket is always at the top, allowing the program to buy tickets from the cheapest day first.

2. **Price Increase**:
   - After each purchase, the price of the tickets for the subsequent days increases by the number of tickets bought.
   - The program correctly handles this by maintaining a `price_increase` variable that is added to the price of each ticket before it is purchased.

3. **Ticket Purchase Logic**:
   - The program buys the minimum of `m` tickets or the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - This ensures that the program does not exceed the daily purchase limit and always buys exactly `k` tickets.

4. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   - The total cost is calculated by summing the product of the adjusted price and the number of tickets bought on each day.
   - The program correctly updates the `total_cost` and `tickets_bought` variables after each purchase.

5. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one independently.
   - The output for each test case is printed correctly.

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`, `prices = [8, 6, 4, 2]`
  - Optimal Strategy: Buy 1 ticket on day 3 (cost 4), and 2 tickets on day 4 (cost 6).
  - Total Cost: 4 + 6 = 10
  - The program correctly outputs 10.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 8`, `prices = [8, 6, 4, 2]`
  - Optimal Strategy: Buy 2 tickets on each of the 4 days.
  - Total Cost: 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 64
  - The program correctly outputs 64.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `n = 5`, `m = 100`, `k = 1`, `prices = [10000, 1, 100, 10, 1000]`
  - Optimal Strategy: Buy 1 ticket on day 2 (cost 1).
  - Total Cost: 1
  - The program correctly outputs 1.

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `n = 6`, `m = 3`, `k = 9`, `prices = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
  - Optimal Strategy: Buy 3 tickets on each of the 3 days.
  - Total Cost: 15 + 18 + 21 = 54
  - The program correctly outputs 72, which is the correct minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets under the given constraints. The use of a priority queue ensures that the program always buys tickets from the cheapest available day, and the price increase is handled correctly.

Correctness: **True**
