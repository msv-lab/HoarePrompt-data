Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers, each in the range 1 to 10^9. `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from `prices` and its corresponding index.**

Explanation: The code snippet creates a new list `pq` by iterating over the `prices` list and pairing each price with its index in the list. The resulting list `pq` contains tuples of the form `(price, index)`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the `prices` list is also unchanged.
