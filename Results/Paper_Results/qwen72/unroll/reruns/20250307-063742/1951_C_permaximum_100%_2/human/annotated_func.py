#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9). prices is a list of n integers, each in the range 1 to 10^9.
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    pq = [(price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        price += price_increase
        
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        
    #State: `tickets_bought` is `k`, `total_cost` is the sum of the costs of the first `k` tickets bought, and `price_increase` is the total number of tickets bought (`k`).
    return total_cost
    #The program returns the sum of the costs of the first `k` tickets bought, where `k` is the total number of tickets bought.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. It returns the total cost of buying the first `k` tickets, where each ticket's price is determined by the initial prices in the `prices` list and increases by the number of tickets bought so far. The function ensures that the total number of tickets bought is exactly `k`, and the total cost reflects the sum of the adjusted prices for these tickets.
