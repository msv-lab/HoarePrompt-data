### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of prices for each day.

2. **Priority Queue Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the prices and their corresponding days. This is a good approach because it allows us to always buy tickets on the cheapest available day.

3. **Heap Operations:**
   - The program uses a while loop to continue buying tickets until the total number of tickets bought (`tickets_bought`) equals `k`.
   - In each iteration, it pops the smallest price from the heap, which is the optimal day to buy tickets.
   - It then increases the price by the total number of tickets bought so far (`price_increase`), which correctly simulates the price increase for subsequent days.

4. **Ticket Purchase Logic:**
   - The program calculates the number of tickets to buy on the current day as the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets that can be bought on a single day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - It updates the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets bought on the current day.
   - It updates the number of tickets bought and the price increase accordingly.

5. **Output:**
   - The program returns the total cost after buying exactly `k` tickets, which is the correct output for the problem.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets, taking into account the constraints and the price increase mechanism. The use of a priority queue ensures that the tickets are always bought on the cheapest available day, and the price increase is correctly applied.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
