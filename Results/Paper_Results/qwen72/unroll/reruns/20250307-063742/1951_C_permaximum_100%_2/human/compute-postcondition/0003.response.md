Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers, each in the range 1 to 10^9. `pq` is a heap (priority queue) containing the same tuples as before, but now they are organized in a heap structure. `total_cost` is 0. `tickets_bought` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes the variable `tickets_bought` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `pq`, or `total_cost`. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions provided, with the addition of `tickets_bought` being 0.
