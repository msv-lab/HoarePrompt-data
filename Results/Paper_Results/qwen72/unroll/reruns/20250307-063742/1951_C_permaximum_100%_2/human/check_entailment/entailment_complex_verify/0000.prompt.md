You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9). prices is a list of n integers, each in the range 1 to 10^9.

    #State: `tickets_bought` is `k`, `total_cost` is the sum of the costs of the first `k` tickets bought, and `price_increase` is the total number of tickets bought (`k`).
    return total_cost
    #The program returns the sum of the costs of the first `k` tickets bought, where `k` is the total number of tickets bought.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. It returns the total cost of buying the first `k` tickets, where each ticket's price is determined by the initial prices in the `prices` list and increases by the number of tickets bought so far. The function ensures that the total number of tickets bought is exactly `k`, and the total cost reflects the sum of the adjusted prices for these tickets.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly k tickets under the given constraints. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Heap Initialization**: The program initializes a min-heap with the ticket prices and their corresponding days. This allows it to always select the cheapest available ticket price.

2. **Heap Operations**: The program uses a while loop to buy tickets until the required number (k) is reached. In each iteration, it pops the smallest price from the heap, increases the price by the total number of tickets bought so far, and then buys the maximum possible tickets (up to m) or the remaining tickets needed to reach k.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The total cost is calculated by multiplying the current price (after the increase) by the number of tickets bought in that iteration.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when k is less than or equal to m, and when the number of tickets to be bought is large. The heap ensures that the program always buys the cheapest tickets first, and the price increase is correctly applied to subsequent days.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
