Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers, each in the range 1 to 10^9. `pq` is a heap (priority queue) containing the same tuples as before, but now they are organized in a heap structure.** 

The `heapq.heapify(pq)` function transforms the list `pq` into a heap in-place, meaning the elements in `pq` are rearranged to satisfy the heap property. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, as do the elements in `prices`. The list `pq` now maintains the heap property, which allows for efficient retrieval of the smallest element.
