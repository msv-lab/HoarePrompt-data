Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly k tickets under the given constraints. The program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets on the day with the lowest current price, and it correctly handles the price increase for subsequent days based on the number of tickets bought. The logic for purchasing tickets and updating the total cost, as well as the price increase, is implemented correctly. Therefore, the program should work as expected for the given problem description.
