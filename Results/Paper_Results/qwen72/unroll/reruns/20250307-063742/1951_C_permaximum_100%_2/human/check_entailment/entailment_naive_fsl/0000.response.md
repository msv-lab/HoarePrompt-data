Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly k tickets under the given constraints. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Heap Initialization**: The program initializes a min-heap with the ticket prices and their corresponding days. This allows it to always select the cheapest available ticket price.

2. **Heap Operations**: The program uses a while loop to buy tickets until the required number (k) is reached. In each iteration, it pops the smallest price from the heap, increases the price by the total number of tickets bought so far, and then buys the maximum possible tickets (up to m) or the remaining tickets needed to reach k.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The total cost is calculated by multiplying the current price (after the increase) by the number of tickets bought in that iteration.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when k is less than or equal to m, and when the number of tickets to be bought is large. The heap ensures that the program always buys the cheapest tickets first, and the price increase is correctly applied to subsequent days.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
