Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. It returns the total cost of buying the first `k` tickets, where each ticket's price is determined by the initial prices in the `prices` list and increases by the number of tickets bought so far. The function ensures that the total number of tickets bought is exactly `k`, and the total cost reflects the sum of the adjusted prices for these tickets. **
