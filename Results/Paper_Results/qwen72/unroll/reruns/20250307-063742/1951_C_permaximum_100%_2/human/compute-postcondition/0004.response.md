Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers, each in the range 1 to 10^9. `pq` is a heap (priority queue) containing the same tuples as before, but now they are organized in a heap structure. `total_cost` is 0. `tickets_bought` is 0. `price_increase` is 0.**

The variable `price_increase` has been initialized to 0, and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
