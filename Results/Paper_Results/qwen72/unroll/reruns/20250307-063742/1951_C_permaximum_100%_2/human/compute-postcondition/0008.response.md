The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of items, with the constraint 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5.
- `m` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets available for each item, with the constraint 1 <= m <= 10^9.
- `k` is a positive integer representing the total number of tickets bought, with the constraint 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9).
- `prices` is a list of `n` integers, each representing the price of an item, with each price in the range 1 to 10^9.

The function returns the sum of the costs of the first `k` tickets bought.
