The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is the integer value provided by the user, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Since `t` is already constrained to be at least 1, the loop will certainly execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the `k` moves is represented by a pair of integers (r_i, c_i) such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and all moves are valid, meaning no two rooks attack each other.**
