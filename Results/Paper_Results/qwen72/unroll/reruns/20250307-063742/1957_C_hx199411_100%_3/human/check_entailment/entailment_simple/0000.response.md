### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Looping Through Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case using a while loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.

2. **Counting Initial Moves:**
   - The program initializes `num` to 0, which is used to count the number of positions that are already occupied or mirrored.
   - It then reads each of the `k` moves and updates `num` based on whether the move is on the diagonal (i.e., `c == r`) or not.
   - If `c == r`, the move is on the diagonal, and only one rook is placed.
   - If `c != r`, the move is not on the diagonal, and two rooks (one white and one black) are placed.

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions:**
   - The program calculates `m` as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions on the board where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - It initializes a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on an `i x i` board.
   - The base cases are set as `dp[1] = 1` (one rook can be placed in one way) and `dp[2] = 3` (three configurations for a 2x2 board).
   - For `i >= 3`, the recurrence relation is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
     - `dp[i - 1]` accounts for the case where the first rook is placed on the first row, and the remaining `i-1` rows are filled.
     - `(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2` accounts for the case where the first rook is placed on the first row, and the second rook is placed on the second row, with the remaining `i-2` rows being filled in two different ways (one for each color).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `dp[m]` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:
The program correctly follows the problem description and uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The logic for counting the initial moves and the recurrence relation for calculating the number of configurations are both sound and correctly implemented.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
