### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - You place a white rook, and the computer places a black rook in the mirrored position.
   - If the rook is placed on the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)), the computer skips its turn.
   - We need to count the number of different final configurations after all possible moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) (the size of the chessboard) and \( k \) (the number of moves already made).
   - It then reads \( k \) moves, each specified by a pair \( (r_i, c_i) \).

3. **Counting Initial Moves:**
   - The program initializes a variable `num` to count the number of rows and columns that are already occupied.
   - For each move, if \( r_i = c_i \), it increments `num` by 1 (since only one position is occupied).
   - If \( r_i \neq c_i \), it increments `num` by 2 (since both \( (r_i, c_i) \) and \( (c_i, r_i) \) are occupied).

4. **Calculating Remaining Positions:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as \( n - \text{num} \), which represents the number of remaining rows and columns that are not yet occupied.

5. **Dynamic Programming for Permutations:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of valid configurations for the remaining positions.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of valid configurations for \( i \) remaining positions.
   - The base cases are:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: There is only one way to place a rook in one position.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: There are three ways to place rooks in two positions (one on the diagonal, and two non-diagonal pairs).
   - For \( i \geq 3 \), the recurrence relation is:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
     - This relation accounts for:
       - Placing a rook in one of the remaining positions and using the previous configuration.
       - Placing a rook in a non-diagonal position and using the configuration for the remaining \( i - 2 \) positions.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of valid configurations for the remaining positions.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.
  - It also correctly reads the \( k \) moves and processes them.

- **Counting Initial Moves:**
  - The program correctly increments `num` by 1 for diagonal moves and by 2 for non-diagonal moves.
  - This ensures that `num` accurately represents the number of rows and columns already occupied.

- **Calculating Remaining Positions:**
  - The calculation of `m` as \( n - \text{num} \) is correct and represents the number of remaining rows and columns that are not yet occupied.

- **Dynamic Programming:**
  - The dynamic programming approach is sound and correctly accounts for the different ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.
  - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correct.
  - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is derived from the problem constraints and correctly handles the modulo operation to avoid large numbers.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of valid configurations for the remaining positions.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description and constraints accurately. The dynamic programming approach and the recurrence relation are well-suited to solve the problem, and the program handles all edge cases and input constraints correctly.

Final: **True**
