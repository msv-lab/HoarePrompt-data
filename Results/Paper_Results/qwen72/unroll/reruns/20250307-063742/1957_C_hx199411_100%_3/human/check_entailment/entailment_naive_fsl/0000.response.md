Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the initial moves already occupy all possible positions for further moves, leading to an incorrect count of final configurations. Specifically, the program does not account for the scenario where the remaining positions (after the initial k moves) are such that no further valid moves can be made. This can happen if the initial moves and their mirrored positions already block all remaining rows and columns.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 2
1 2
2 1
```
After the initial 2 moves, the board will have a white rook at (1, 2) and a black rook at (2, 1). The remaining positions are (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), and (4, 4). However, placing a rook at (3, 3) or (4, 4) will not allow the computer to make a move, and placing a rook at (3, 4) or (4, 3) will result in the computer placing a rook at (4, 3) or (3, 4), respectively, which would be invalid because it would attack the rook placed by the player. The program does not handle this edge case correctly and will output an incorrect number of configurations.
