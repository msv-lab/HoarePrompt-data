Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.

2. **Counting Initial Rooks**: For each of the `k` moves, the program counts the number of rooks already placed on the board. If the move is a diagonal move (i.e., `c == r`), it counts as one rook. Otherwise, it counts as two rooks (one white and one black).

3. **Remaining Positions**: The program calculates the number of remaining positions `m` that can be used for placing rooks after accounting for the initial `k` moves and their mirrored positions.

4. **Dynamic Programming**: The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations. The `dp` array is initialized to handle the number of configurations for a given number of remaining positions. The base cases are:
   - `dp[1] = 1`: If there is only one remaining position, there is only one configuration.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: If there are two remaining positions, there are three configurations (one for each pair of positions).

5. **DP Transition**: The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions. It considers:
   - Placing a rook in one of the remaining positions and using the previous configuration (`dp[i - 1]`).
   - Placing two rooks in the remaining positions, considering the mirrored positions (`(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2`).

6. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The program handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement, making it a correct solution.
