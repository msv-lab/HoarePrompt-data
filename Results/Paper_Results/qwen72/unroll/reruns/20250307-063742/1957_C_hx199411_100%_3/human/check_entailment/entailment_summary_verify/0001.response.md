### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - You place a white rook, and the computer places a black rook in the mirrored position.
   - If the rook is placed on the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)), the computer skips its turn.
   - We need to count the number of different final configurations after all possible moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) (the size of the chessboard) and \( k \) (the number of moves already made).
   - It then reads \( k \) moves, each specified by a pair \( (r_i, c_i) \).

3. **Counting Initial Moves:**
   - The program initializes a variable `num` to count the number of rows and columns that are already occupied.
   - For each move, if \( r_i = c_i \), it increments `num` by 1 (since only one position is occupied).
   - If \( r_i \neq c_i \), it increments `num` by 2 (since both \( (r_i, c_i) \) and \( (c_i, r_i) \) are occupied).
   - This part of the program is correct and accurately counts the number of occupied rows and columns.

4. **Calculating Remaining Positions:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as \( n - \text{num} \), which represents the number of remaining rows and columns that are not yet occupied.
   - This calculation is correct and follows the problem description.

5. **Dynamic Programming for Permutations:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of valid configurations for the remaining positions.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of valid configurations for \( i \) remaining positions.
   - The base cases are:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: There is only one way to place a rook in one position.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: There are three ways to place rooks in two positions (one on the diagonal, and two non-diagonal pairs).
   - For \( i \geq 3 \), the recurrence relation is:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
     - This relation accounts for:
       - Placing a rook in one of the remaining positions and using the previous configuration.
       - Placing a rook in a non-diagonal position and using the configuration for the remaining \( i - 2 \) positions.
   - The recurrence relation is derived from the problem constraints and correctly handles the modulo operation to avoid large numbers.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of valid configurations for the remaining positions.
   - The output is correctly formatted and follows the problem description.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and calculates the number of occupied positions.
- The dynamic programming approach is sound and correctly accounts for the different ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.
- The recurrence relation is derived from the problem constraints and correctly handles the modulo operation to avoid large numbers.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description and constraints accurately.

Final: **True**
