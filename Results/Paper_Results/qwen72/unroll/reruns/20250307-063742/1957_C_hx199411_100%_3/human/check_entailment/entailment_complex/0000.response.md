### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads `k` moves, each represented by a pair of integers `(r_i, c_i)`.

2. **Move Counting:**
   - The function counts the number of moves where `r_i == c_i` (diagonal moves) and adds 1 to `num` for each such move.
   - For non-diagonal moves, it adds 2 to `num` because each such move results in two rooks (one white and one black) being placed on the board.

3. **Remaining Moves Calculation:**
   - The function calculates `m` as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions on the board that can be used for placing rooks.

4. **Dynamic Programming Initialization:**
   - The function initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` to store the number of valid configurations for different values of `m`.
   - It sets `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` as base cases. These values are correct because:
     - For `m = 1`, there is only one way to place a rook on the board.
     - For `m = 2`, there are three ways to place rooks: (1, 2) and (2, 1), (1, 1) and (2, 2), or (1, 2) and (2, 2).

5. **DP Array Filling:**
   - The function fills the DP array using the recurrence relation:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
   - This recurrence relation is correct because:
     - `dp[i - 1]` accounts for the configurations where the last rook is placed in a way that doesn't affect the previous configurations.
     - `(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2` accounts for the configurations where the last two rooks are placed in a way that they form a valid configuration with the previous rooks. The factor of 2 is because the last two rooks can be placed in two different ways (one white and one black, or one black and one white).

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the value of `dp[m]` for each test case, which represents the number of valid configurations for the remaining positions on the board.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the input, processes the moves, and uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of valid configurations. The recurrence relation and base cases are appropriate for the problem, and the modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required range.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
