The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`: An integer representing the size of the chessboard, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5.
- `k`: An integer representing the number of moves, where 0 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `moves`: A list of `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)`, where each pair represents a move on the chessboard, and 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. All moves are valid, meaning no two rooks attack each other.

The function returns the result of processing these test cases, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Given the context, it is likely that the function returns some information about the state of the chessboard or the positions of the rooks after the moves.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, the size of the chessboard `n`, the number of moves `k`, and a list of `k` valid moves `(r_i, c_i)` on the chessboard. It processes these moves and returns information about the state of the chessboard or the positions of the rooks after the moves.**
