Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.

2. **Move Processing**: The program processes the `k` moves by reading each move `(r_i, c_i)`. It counts the number of rooks placed on the diagonal (where `r_i == c_i`) and non-diagonal positions. This is done using the variable `num`, which is incremented by 1 for diagonal moves and by 2 for non-diagonal moves.

3. **Remaining Positions Calculation**: The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions on the chessboard that can be used for placing rooks.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Rook Placement**: The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of valid configurations for placing rooks on the remaining `m` positions. The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, which are the base cases for 1 and 2 remaining positions, respectively.

5. **DP Transition**: The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to fill the DP array. This formula correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on `i` positions, considering both the cases where the last rook is placed on a diagonal and where it is placed on a non-diagonal position.

6. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is `dp[m]` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

7. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where `m` is 0 or 1 by printing 1, which is correct because there is only one way to place no rooks or one rook on the board.

8. **Modulo Operation**: The program consistently applies the modulo operation to ensure that the results do not overflow and are within the required range.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The dynamic programming approach and the transition formula are appropriate for the problem, and the edge cases are handled correctly.

Correctness: **True**
