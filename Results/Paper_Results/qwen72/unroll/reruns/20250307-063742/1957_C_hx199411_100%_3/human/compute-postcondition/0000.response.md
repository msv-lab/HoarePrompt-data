The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The other conditions regarding `n`, `k`, and the moves (r_i, c_i) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the `k` moves is represented by a pair of integers (r_i, c_i) such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and all moves are valid, meaning no two rooks attack each other.**
