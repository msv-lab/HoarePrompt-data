You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6

    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each defined by a chessboard size `n` and a number of moves `k`. For each test case, it processes `k` moves, each represented by a pair of integers `(r_i, c_i)`, and calculates the number of ways to place rooks on the chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other, given the moves. The function prints the result for each test case, which is the number of valid configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\). After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0 and all other variables in their final states.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - You place a white rook, and the computer places a black rook in the mirrored position.
   - If the rook is placed on the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)), the computer skips its turn.
   - We need to count the number of different final configurations after all possible moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) (the size of the chessboard) and \( k \) (the number of moves already made).
   - It then reads \( k \) moves, each specified by a pair \( (r_i, c_i) \).

3. **Counting Initial Moves:**
   - The program initializes a variable `num` to count the number of rows and columns that are already occupied.
   - For each move, if \( r_i = c_i \), it increments `num` by 1 (since only one position is occupied).
   - If \( r_i \neq c_i \), it increments `num` by 2 (since both \( (r_i, c_i) \) and \( (c_i, r_i) \) are occupied).

4. **Calculating Remaining Positions:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as \( n - \text{num} \), which represents the number of remaining rows and columns that are not yet occupied.

5. **Dynamic Programming for Permutations:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of valid configurations for the remaining positions.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of valid configurations for \( i \) remaining positions.
   - The base cases are:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: There is only one way to place a rook in one position.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: There are three ways to place rooks in two positions (one on the diagonal, and two non-diagonal pairs).
   - For \( i \geq 3 \), the recurrence relation is:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
     - This relation accounts for:
       - Placing a rook in one of the remaining positions and using the previous configuration.
       - Placing a rook in a non-diagonal position and using the configuration for the remaining \( i - 2 \) positions.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of valid configurations for the remaining positions.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and calculates the number of occupied positions.
- The dynamic programming approach is sound and correctly accounts for the different ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.
- The recurrence relation is derived from the problem constraints and correctly handles the modulo operation to avoid large numbers.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description and constraints accurately.

Correctness: **True**
