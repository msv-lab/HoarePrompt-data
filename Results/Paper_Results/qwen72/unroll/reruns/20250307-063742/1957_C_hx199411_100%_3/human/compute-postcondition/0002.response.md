Output State: **The loop will have executed `t` times, and for each execution, the value of `m` is calculated and the corresponding value in the `dp` array is printed. The final value of `t` will be 0, and all other variables (`n`, `k`, `num`, `dp`, `m`, `c`, `r`, `i`) will be in their final states after the last iteration of the loop.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: The variable `t` is set to a value provided by the user, and this value determines the number of test cases to be processed.
- **Loop Execution**: For each test case, the loop reads `n` and `k` from the input, initializes `num` to 0, and then processes `k` moves. For each move, it updates `num` based on whether the move is on the diagonal (`c == r`) or not (`c != r`).
- **Calculation of `m`**: After processing all `k` moves, `m` is calculated as `n - num`.
- **Dynamic Programming Calculation**: If `m` is 0 or 1, the loop prints 1. Otherwise, it initializes a `dp` array and fills it according to the given recurrence relation. The final value of `dp[m]` is printed.
- **Final State**: After all `t` test cases are processed, the loop terminates, and `t` is 0. The variables `n`, `k`, `num`, `dp`, `m`, `c`, `r`, and `i` will have their final values from the last test case processed.

Thus, the output state is that the loop has completed all its iterations, and the final value of `t` is 0. The other variables will have their final values from the last test case.
