Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases, each defined by a chessboard size `n` and a number of moves `k`. For each test case, it processes `k` moves, each represented by a pair of integers `(r_i, c_i)`, and calculates the number of ways to place rooks on the chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other, given the moves. The function prints the result for each test case, which is the number of valid configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\). After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0 and all other variables in their final states. **
