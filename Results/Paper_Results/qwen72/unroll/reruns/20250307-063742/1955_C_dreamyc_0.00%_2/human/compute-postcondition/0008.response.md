The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `nums`, with the constraint 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. `k` is a positive integer with the constraint 1 <= k <= 10^15. `nums` is a list of positive integers of length `n`, where each element satisfies 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9.

The function returns:
- Case_1: If the loop stops and the final element in `nums` is also counted as reduced to 0, the function returns `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the number of elements that were completely reduced to 0 before the loop stopped.
- Case_2: If the loop stops but the final element in `nums` is not counted as reduced to 0, the function returns the number of elements in the list `nums` that have been completely reduced to 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. It returns the number of elements in `nums` that have been completely reduced to 0. If the final element is also counted as reduced to 0, it returns `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the count of elements reduced to 0 before the loop stopped. Otherwise, it returns the count of elements reduced to 0.**
