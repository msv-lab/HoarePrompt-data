You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, nums is a list of positive integers of length n, where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `k` is reduced by the maximum possible even value that can be subtracted using the minimum of the two elements removed from `nums` in each iteration, and `ans` is incremented by the number of elements that are completely reduced to 0. The loop stops when either `k` is less than twice the minimum of the two elements or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the number of elements that were completely reduced to 0 before the loop stopped, and the final element in `nums` is also counted as reduced to 0.
    #State: `k` is reduced by the maximum possible even value that can be subtracted using the minimum of the two elements removed from `nums` in each iteration, and `ans` is incremented by the number of elements that are completely reduced to 0. The loop stops when either `k` is less than twice the minimum of the two elements or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. Additionally, either `k` is not equal to the single element in `nums` (if `len(nums) == 1`), or `len(nums)` is not equal to 1, or `k` is less than the single element in `nums` (if `len(nums) == 1`).
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of elements in the list `nums` that have been completely reduced to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. It returns the number of elements in `nums` that have been completely reduced to 0. If the final element is also counted as reduced to 0, it returns `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the count of elements reduced to 0 before the loop stopped. Otherwise, it returns the count of elements reduced to 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the number of elements that were completely reduced to 0 before the loop stopped, and the final element in `nums` is also counted as reduced to 0.

Case_2: The program returns the number of elements in the list `nums` that have been completely reduced to 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
