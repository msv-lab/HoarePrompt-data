Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the Kraken attacks the ships an odd number of times and the remaining ships are more than one. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the Kraken will always attack both the first and last ship in pairs, which is not true for the last attack if `k` is odd.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
4 7
1 2 4 3
```
Expected output:
```
3
```
Actual output:
```
2
```
Explanation:
1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero, and now `nums = [2, 4, 3]`.
2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now `nums = [2, 4, 2]`.
3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now `nums = [1, 4, 2]`.
4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now `nums = [1, 4, 1]`.
5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero, and now `nums = [4, 1]`.
6. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now `nums = [4]`.
7. The Kraken attacks the last ship, its durability becomes zero, and now `nums = []`.

The program should output 3, but it outputs 2 because it fails to handle the last attack correctly when `k` is odd.
