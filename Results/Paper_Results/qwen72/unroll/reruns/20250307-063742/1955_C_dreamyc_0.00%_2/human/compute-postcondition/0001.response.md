Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of positive integers of length `n`, where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9, `ans` is 0.** 

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, while the values of `n`, `k`, and the deque `nums` remain unchanged.
