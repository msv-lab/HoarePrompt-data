Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of positive integers of length `n`, where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9.**

The list `nums` has been converted into a deque, but the values and the length of `nums` remain the same. The variables `n` and `k` are unchanged and still adhere to their initial constraints.
