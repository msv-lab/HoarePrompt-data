Postcondition: **`k` is reduced by the maximum possible even value that can be subtracted using the minimum of the two elements removed from `nums` in each iteration, and `ans` is incremented by the number of elements that are completely reduced to 0. The loop stops when either `k` is less than twice the minimum of the two elements or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. Additionally, either `k` is not equal to the single element in `nums` (if `len(nums) == 1`), or `len(nums)` is not equal to 1, or `k` is less than the single element in `nums` (if `len(nums) == 1`).**
