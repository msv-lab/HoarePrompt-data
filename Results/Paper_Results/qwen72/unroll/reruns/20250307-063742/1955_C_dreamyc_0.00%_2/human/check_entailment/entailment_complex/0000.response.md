### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`, followed by the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the Kraken's attacks and count the number of ships that sink.
   - It uses a `deque` to efficiently remove elements from both ends of the list.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are at least two ships left and `k` is greater than 0.
   - In each iteration, it removes the first and last ship from the `deque` and calculates the minimum durability between the two.
   - It then reduces both ships' durabilities by this minimum value and decreases `k` by twice this value.
   - If a ship's durability is still positive after the reduction, it is added back to the `deque`.
   - If a ship's durability reaches 0, it is considered sunk, and the `ans` counter is incremented.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the main loop, if there is exactly one ship left and `k` is greater than or equal to its durability, this ship is also sunk, and `ans` is incremented by 1.

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns the total number of ships that were sunk.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The use of `deque` ensures efficient removal and addition of elements from both ends.
- The main loop correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks by reducing the durabilities of the first and last ships and updating `k` and `ans` accordingly.
- The final check ensures that if there is one ship left and `k` is sufficient to sink it, it is counted as sunk.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Ship:**
  - If `n` is 1, the loop will not run, and the final check will determine if the single ship is sunk.
- **No Attacks:**
  - If `k` is 0, no attacks will occur, and the function will return 0.
- **Large `k`:**
  - If `k` is very large, the loop will continue until all ships are sunk or `k` is exhausted.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
