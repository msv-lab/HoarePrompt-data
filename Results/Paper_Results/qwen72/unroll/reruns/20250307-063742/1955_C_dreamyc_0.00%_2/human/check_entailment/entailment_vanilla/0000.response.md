### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Deque Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a deque `nums` to efficiently handle the removal of elements from both ends of the list.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The program enters a loop that continues as long as there are attacks remaining (`k > 0`) and there are at least two ships left (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - In each iteration, it removes the first and last ships from the deque and calculates the minimum durability `x` between these two ships.
   - If the number of remaining attacks `k` is sufficient to reduce both ships' durabilities by `x`, it does so and updates `k` accordingly.
   - If the first ship (`a`) still has positive durability, it is added back to the deque. Otherwise, it is considered sunk, and the count of sunk ships `ans` is incremented.
   - Similarly, if the last ship (`b`) still has positive durability, it is added back to the deque. Otherwise, it is considered sunk, and the count of sunk ships `ans` is incremented.

4. **Single Ship Remaining:**
   - If the loop exits and there is exactly one ship left in the deque, the program checks if the remaining attacks `k` are sufficient to sink this ship.
   - If so, it increments the count of sunk ships `ans` by 1.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of sunk ships for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correct Handling of Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to process each test case independently.

- **Efficient Use of Deque:**
  - Using a deque allows for efficient removal and insertion of elements from both ends of the list, which is crucial for simulating the Kraken's attacks on the first and last ships.

- **Correct Calculation of Sunk Ships:**
  - The program correctly calculates the number of ships sunk by the Kraken. It ensures that ships are only considered sunk when their durability reaches zero and are no longer part of the deque.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases where there is only one ship left and the remaining attacks are sufficient to sink it.
  - It also handles cases where the number of attacks is insufficient to sink any more ships, ensuring the loop exits correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and handles all the requirements and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
