#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, nums is a list of positive integers of length n, where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x

    #State: `k` is reduced by the maximum possible even value that can be subtracted using the minimum of the two elements removed from `nums` in each iteration, and `ans` is incremented by the number of elements that are completely reduced to 0. The loop stops when either `k` is less than twice the minimum of the two elements or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the number of elements that were completely reduced to 0 before the loop stopped, and the final element in `nums` is also counted as reduced to 0.
    #State: `k` is reduced by the maximum possible even value that can be subtracted using the minimum of the two elements removed from `nums` in each iteration, and `ans` is incremented by the number of elements that are completely reduced to 0. The loop stops when either `k` is less than twice the minimum of the two elements or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. Additionally, either `k` is not equal to the single element in `nums` (if `len(nums) == 1`), or `len(nums)` is not equal to 1, or `k` is less than the single element in `nums` (if `len(nums) == 1`).
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of elements in the list `nums` that have been completely reduced to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), and `nums` (a list of positive integers). It returns the number of elements in `nums` that have been completely reduced to 0. The function reduces elements in `nums` by the maximum possible even value that can be subtracted from the minimum of two elements removed from the list in each iteration, until `k` is less than twice the minimum of the two elements or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. If, after the loop, `k` is greater than or equal to the single remaining element in `nums` (if `nums` has exactly one element), the function returns `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the count of elements reduced to 0 before the loop stopped. Otherwise, it returns `ans`.
