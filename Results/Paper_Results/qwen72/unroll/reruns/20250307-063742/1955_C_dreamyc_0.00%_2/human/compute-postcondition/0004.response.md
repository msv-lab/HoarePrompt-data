Postcondition: **`k` is reduced by the maximum possible even value that can be subtracted using the minimum of the two elements removed from `nums` in each iteration, and `ans` is incremented by the number of elements that are completely reduced to 0. The loop stops when either `k` is less than twice the minimum of the two elements or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. `nums` has exactly 1 element, and the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`.**
