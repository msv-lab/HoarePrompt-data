The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), and `nums` (a list of positive integers). It returns the number of elements in `nums` that have been completely reduced to 0. The function reduces elements in `nums` by the maximum possible even value that can be subtracted from the minimum of two elements removed from the list in each iteration, until `k` is less than twice the minimum of the two elements or `nums` has fewer than 2 elements. If, after the loop, `k` is greater than or equal to the single remaining element in `nums` (if `nums` has exactly one element), the function returns `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the count of elements reduced to 0 before the loop stopped. Otherwise, it returns `ans`.
