Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It uses a `deque` to efficiently manage the ships being attacked from both ends. The program iterates through the attacks, reducing the durability of the ships and counting how many ships have sunk. The logic for handling the attacks and the conditions for when to stop attacking or when a single ship remains are all correctly implemented. Therefore, the program should produce the correct output for the given problem description.
