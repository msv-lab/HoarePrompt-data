### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function converts the list `nums` into a deque to efficiently pop elements from both ends.
   - It initializes a counter `ans` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are at least two ships and the Kraken has remaining attacks (`k`).
   - In each iteration, it pops the first and last ship's durability values (`a` and `b`).
   - It calculates the minimum of these two values (`x`), which represents the maximum number of attacks that can be evenly distributed between the two ships.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, it reduces both `a` and `b` by `x` and decreases `k` by `2 * x`.
   - If `a` is still greater than 0 after the reduction, it is appended back to the deque at the front.
   - If `b` is still greater than 0 after the reduction, it is appended back to the deque at the back.
   - If either `a` or `b` is reduced to 0 or less, the corresponding ship is sunk, and `ans` is incremented.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the main loop, if there is exactly one ship left and the Kraken has enough remaining attacks to sink it (`k >= nums[0]`), the program increments `ans` by 1.
   - The program then returns the total number of ships sunk.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k` is not enough to sink any ships.
   - It also handles the case where all ships are sunk before `k` attacks are exhausted.

### Correctness:
- The program follows the problem description accurately.
- It correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and updates the durabilities of the ships.
- The logic for counting the number of sunk ships is sound and handles all edge cases.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
