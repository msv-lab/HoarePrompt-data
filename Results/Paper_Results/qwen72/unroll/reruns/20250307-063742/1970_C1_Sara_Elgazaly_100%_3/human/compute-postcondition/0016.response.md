Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but reads input from the user to define the number of nodes `n` and the starting node `z` for a game theory problem on a tree. It constructs a tree using adjacency lists for both forward and reverse directions. The function determines the outcome of the game by checking the parity of the path lengths from the starting node `z` to the leaf nodes in both directions. If both path lengths are even, it prints 'Hermione'; otherwise, it prints 'Ron'. The values of `n` and `z` remain unchanged, and no other variables are modified or returned. **
