Output State: **The function `func` is designed to solve a game theory problem on a tree with specific constraints. The input is implicitly defined by the problem description and includes: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, an integer t (t=1) representing the number of rounds, a list of n-1 edges where each edge is represented by a pair of integers (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) indicating a connection between nodes u and v, and a list of t integers (1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n) representing the starting node for each round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the first and second integers read from the input, respectively. `lst` is a defaultdict of lists.**
