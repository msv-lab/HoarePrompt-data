Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `lst` dictionary will contain lists of child nodes for each node from 1 to `x`, and the `rev` dictionary will contain lists of parent nodes for each node from 2 to `x`. The values of `x` and `y` will remain unchanged. The variable `t` and the list of starting nodes for each round will also remain unchanged. `z` is an input integer, and `tmp` is now equal to `z`. `one` is now `True`.
Code of the loop:
while lst[tmp] != []:
    one = not one
    tmp = lst[tmp].pop()



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
