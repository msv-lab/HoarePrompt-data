Output State: **The `lst` dictionary will contain lists of child nodes for each node from 1 to `x`, and the `rev` dictionary will contain lists of parent nodes for each node from 2 to `x`. The values of `x` and `y` will remain unchanged. The variable `t` and the list of starting nodes for each round will also remain unchanged. `z` is an input integer, and `tmp` is now equal to `z`.**
