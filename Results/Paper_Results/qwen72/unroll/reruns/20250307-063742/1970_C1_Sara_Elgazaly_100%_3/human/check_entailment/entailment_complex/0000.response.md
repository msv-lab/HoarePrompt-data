### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The program constructs the tree using two dictionaries: `lst` for storing the children of each node and `rev` for storing the parents of each node.
   - This representation is correct and aligns with the problem's constraints.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - The game is played on a tree with exactly two leaves, which can be treated as an array-like structure.
   - The game starts with a stone on a given node, and players alternate moves by moving the stone to an inactive neighbor until no valid moves are left.

3. **Path Length Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the path length from the starting node `z` to the leaves in both directions (forward and backward).
   - It uses a while loop to traverse the tree from the starting node to a leaf in the forward direction (`lst`), and another while loop to traverse the tree in the backward direction (`rev`).
   - The variable `one` is toggled for each step in the forward direction, and `two` is toggled for each step in the backward direction. This effectively checks the parity of the path lengths.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
   - If both path lengths (from the starting node to the leaves) are even, Hermione wins. Otherwise, Ron wins.
   - The program prints 'Hermione' if both `one` and `two` are `True`, and 'Ron' otherwise.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the tree has exactly two leaves, which is guaranteed by the problem constraints.
   - The input and output formats match the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner based on the parity of the path lengths from the starting node to the leaves. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem's constraints and requirements.

**Correctness: True**
