Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is designed to solve a game theory problem on a tree with specific constraints. The input is implicitly defined by the problem description and includes: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, an integer t (t=1) representing the number of rounds, a list of n-1 edges where each edge is represented by a pair of integers (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) indicating a connection between nodes u and v, and a list of t integers (1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n) representing the starting node for each round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the first and second integers read from the input, respectively. `lst` is a defaultdict of lists. `rev` is now a defaultdict of lists.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(x - 1):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    lst[a].append(b)
    rev[b].append(a)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
