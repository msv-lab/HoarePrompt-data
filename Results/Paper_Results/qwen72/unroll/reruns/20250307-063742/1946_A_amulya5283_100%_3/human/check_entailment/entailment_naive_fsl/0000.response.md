Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the median needs to be increased. Specifically, the logic for counting the number of operations is flawed. The program increments the result (`res`) for every element that is equal to the current median, which is incorrect. The correct approach should involve finding the smallest number greater than the current median and calculating the number of operations required to make the current median equal to this next number.

Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

In this case, the current median is 2. To increase the median, we need to increment one of the elements at index 1 (0-based) to 3, which would make the sorted array [1, 3, 3, 4] and the new median 3. The program, however, outputs 0, which is incorrect.
