#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is missing the parameters in the function definition. The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `n`, and `a` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `a` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `a` is a list of integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for each test case. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            res = 0
            mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
            for i in range(mdx, n):
                if a[mdx] == a[i]:
                    res += 1
            print(res)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and `t` is now 0. The variables `n` and `a` have been updated for each test case, and the results for each test case have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It sorts the list `a` and then counts the number of elements in the second half of the sorted list that are equal to the middle element. The function prints the count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the input variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are no longer relevant.
