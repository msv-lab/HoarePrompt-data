### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, but it reads inputs directly from `input()`. This is a common practice for competitive programming where the function is called once and handles multiple test cases.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case in a loop.

2. **Array Sorting:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, which is necessary to find the median.

3. **Median Calculation:**
   - The median index `mdx` is calculated correctly using `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula works for both even and odd lengths of the array:
     - For odd `n`, `mdx` is the middle index.
     - For even `n`, `mdx` is the first of the two middle indices.

4. **Operation Counting:**
   - The loop iterates from `mdx` to `n-1` to count the number of elements that are equal to the median. This is incorrect because it does not count the operations needed to increase the median.
   - The correct approach should be to find the smallest number greater than the current median and count the operations needed to make the current median equal to this number.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is the number of operations required to increase the median.

### Issues:
- The loop `for i in range(mdx, n):` is counting the number of elements equal to the median, which is not the correct way to determine the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.
- The correct approach should be to find the smallest number greater than the current median and calculate the number of operations needed to make the median equal to this number.

### Corrected Approach:
- For an odd-length array, the median is the middle element.
- For an even-length array, the median is the first of the two middle elements.
- To increase the median, find the smallest element greater than the current median and count the operations needed to make the median equal to this element.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            mdx = n // 2
            median = a[mdx]
            next_median = a[mdx + 1] if n % 2 == 0 else a[mdx + 1]
            operations = next_median - median
            print(operations)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of operations needed to increase the median.
- The corrected code correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
