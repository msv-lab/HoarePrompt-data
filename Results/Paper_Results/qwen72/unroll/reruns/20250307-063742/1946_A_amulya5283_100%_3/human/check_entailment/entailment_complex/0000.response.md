Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters**: The function `func` is defined without parameters, but it reads the necessary inputs (`t`, `n`, and `a`) within the function. This is a common pattern in competitive programming where the function is designed to handle input directly from the standard input. However, it would be more conventional to pass these parameters to the function, but for the purpose of this problem, the current approach is acceptable.

2. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

3. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted using `a.sort()`, which is correct for finding the median.

4. **Median Calculation and Increment Count**:
   - For an array of length `n`, the median is the element at index `mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` in the sorted array. This is correct because:
     - For an odd-length array, `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` simplifies to `n // 2`, which is the middle index.
     - For an even-length array, `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` simplifies to `n // 2 - 1`, which is the first of the two middle indices.
   - The function then counts the number of elements in the second half of the sorted array that are equal to the median element `a[mdx]`. This is incorrect because:
     - The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median, not to count the number of elements equal to the median.
     - To increase the median, you need to increase the value of the median element itself or the elements around it to ensure the new median is greater than the current median.

5. **Output**: The function prints the count `res` for each test case, which is not the correct output based on the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function should instead focus on increasing the median element or the elements around it to ensure the new median is greater than the current median.

Correctness: **False**
