Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It sorts the list `a` and then counts the number of elements in the second half of the sorted list that are equal to the middle element. The function prints the count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the input variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are no longer relevant. **
