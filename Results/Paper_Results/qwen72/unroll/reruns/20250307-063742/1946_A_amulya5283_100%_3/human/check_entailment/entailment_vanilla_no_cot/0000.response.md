Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Median Index**:
   - The code calculates the median index as `mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This is incorrect. The correct median index for an array of length `n` should be `mdx = n // 2` for even `n` and `mdx = n // 2` for odd `n` (since Python uses 0-based indexing).

2. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Operations**:
   - The code iterates from `mdx` to `n` and increments `res` for each element that is equal to `a[mdx]`. This logic is flawed because it does not account for the actual operations needed to increase the median.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median, not to count how many elements are equal to the current median.

3. **Handling of Even and Odd Length Arrays**:
   - The code does not handle the difference between even and odd length arrays correctly. For an even-length array, the median is the average of the two middle elements, but the code does not consider this.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, you need to:

1. **Sort the Array**:
   - Sort the array to find the median.

2. **Determine the Median**:
   - For an odd-length array, the median is the middle element.
   - For an even-length array, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

3. **Find the Minimum Operations**:
   - For an odd-length array, find the minimum number of operations required to make the middle element greater than its current value.
   - For an even-length array, find the minimum number of operations required to make the second middle element greater than the first middle element.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            if n % 2 == 1:
                # Odd length array
                mdx = n // 2
                target = a[mdx] + 1
                res = target - a[mdx]
            else:
                # Even length array
                mdx1 = n // 2 - 1
                mdx2 = n // 2
                target = a[mdx2] + 1
                res = target - a[mdx1]
                
            print(res)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **Odd Length Array**:
  - The median is `a[mdx]` where `mdx = n // 2`.
  - To increase the median, we need to make `a[mdx]` greater than its current value. The minimum number of operations required is `1` (to make `a[mdx]` equal to `a[mdx] + 1`).

- **Even Length Array**:
  - The median is the average of `a[mdx1]` and `a[mdx2]` where `mdx1 = n // 2 - 1` and `mdx2 = n // 2`.
  - To increase the median, we need to make `a[mdx1]` greater than `a[mdx2]`. The minimum number of operations required is `a[mdx2] - a[mdx1] + 1`.

This corrected program should correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
