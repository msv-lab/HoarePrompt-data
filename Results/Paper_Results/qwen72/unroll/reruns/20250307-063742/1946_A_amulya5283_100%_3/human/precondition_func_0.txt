The function `func` is missing the parameters in the function definition. The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `n`, and `a` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `a` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `a` is a list of integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for each test case. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
