The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `a` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `a` is a list of integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for each test case. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns the results for each test case based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the array `a`, and `a` is a list of integers. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the input array `a`.**
