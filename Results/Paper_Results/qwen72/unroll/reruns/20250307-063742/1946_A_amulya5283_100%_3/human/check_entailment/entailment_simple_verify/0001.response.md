Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by reading the length of the array \( n \) and the array \( a \).

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array \( a \) is correctly sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Special Case for Single Element Array:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( n = 1 \) by printing 1. This is accurate because the median of a single-element array is the element itself, and to increase it, we need exactly one operation.

4. **Finding the Median Index:**
   - The median index \( mdx \) is calculated as \( n // 2 + n \% 2 - 1 \). This formula correctly finds the middle index for both even and odd lengths of the array.

5. **Counting Operations:**
   - The program initializes a result variable \( res \) to 0.
   - It then iterates from the median index \( mdx \) to the end of the array.
   - For each element \( a[i] \) from \( mdx \) to \( n-1 \), if \( a[mdx] \) is equal to \( a[i] \), it increments \( res \).

   **Issue:**
   - The logic for counting operations is incorrect. The program counts the number of elements from the median index to the end of the array that are equal to the current median. This does not help in determining the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the smallest element greater than the current median and calculate the number of operations required to make the current median equal to this next value.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result \( res \), which is incorrect as explained above.

### Correct Approach:
- **For Odd Length Arrays:**
  - The median is the middle element \( a[mdx] \).
  - We need to find the smallest element greater than \( a[mdx] \) and calculate the number of operations required to make \( a[mdx] \) equal to this next value.

- **For Even Length Arrays:**
  - The median is the average of the two middle elements \( a[mdx] \) and \( a[mdx + 1] \).
  - We need to find the smallest element greater than \( a[mdx + 1] \) and calculate the number of operations required to make \( a[mdx + 1] \) equal to this next value.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. It incorrectly counts the number of elements equal to the current median instead of finding the next greater value and calculating the operations needed.

Final: **False**
