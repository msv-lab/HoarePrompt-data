Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Description:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Program Analysis:

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`
This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. It is a standard and correct implementation of the GCD function.

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
```

#### Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`
This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   cnt = 0
   ```
   This initializes a counter to zero.

2. **Loop over \(b\)**:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, m):
   ```
   This loop iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\). Note that it should iterate up to \(m\) inclusive, so the correct range should be `range(1, m + 1)`.

3. **Calculate \(x\) and \(y\)**:
   ```python
   x = n - (i * i - i)
   y = i * i
   ```
   Here, \(x\) and \(y\) are calculated as follows:
   - \(x = n - (i^2 - i)\)
   - \(y = i^2\)

4. **Update the counter**:
   ```python
   cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
   ```
   This updates the counter by adding the integer division of \(x\) by \(y\) and an additional 1 if \(i > 1\).

5. **Special case for \(cnt == 0\)**:
   ```python
   if cnt == 0:
       return 1
   return cnt
   ```
   If the counter is zero, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the counter.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Loop Range**:
   The loop should iterate from 1 to \(m\) inclusive, but it currently iterates from 1 to \(m-1\). This means the pair \((a, m)\) is never considered, which is incorrect.

2. **Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**:
   The calculation of \(x\) and \(y\) does not seem to directly relate to the problem's conditions. Specifically, \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not being checked correctly.

3. **Special Case**:
   The special case where \(cnt == 0\) and returning 1 is not justified by the problem statement. It seems to be an ad-hoc addition without a clear reason.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not properly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) and has an incorrect loop range.

Correctness: **False**
