Output State: **The program returns the updated value of `cnt`, which is `n` plus the sum of integer divisions of `n - i * (i - 1)` by `i * i` for `i` from 1 to `m-1`, plus the number of iterations where `i > 1`.** 

In natural language, this means the program calculates `cnt` by starting with the value of `n`, then adding the results of dividing `n - i * (i - 1)` by `i * i` for each `i` from 1 up to but not including `m`. Additionally, it adds the count of how many times `i` was greater than 1 during these iterations. The final value of `cnt` is then returned.
