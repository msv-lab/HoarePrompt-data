### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The state of the program before the function call is that \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers within the given range.
   - The state after the function call is that the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) is returned, and \(b\) is 0 (though \(b\) being 0 is not relevant to the problem).

3. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - The function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\).
   - It then updates the count `cnt` by adding \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{y} \right\rfloor + (i > 1)\).
   - Finally, it returns `cnt` if it is not zero, otherwise, it returns 1.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic in `func_2` does not directly correspond to the problem statement. Specifically, the calculation of \(x\) and \(y\) and the update of `cnt` do not seem to be based on the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) implies that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\). This can be rewritten as \(a + b = b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \cdot k\), which simplifies to \(a = b \cdot (\gcd(a, b) \cdot k - 1)\).
   - The current implementation in `func_2` does not correctly handle this condition. It seems to be performing some arbitrary calculations that do not align with the problem's requirements.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case \((1, 1)\), the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\), and the program correctly returns 1.
   - For the fourth test case \((10, 8)\), the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), and \((10, 2)\), which totals 14 pairs. The program returns 14, which is correct.
   - However, the logic in `func_2` is not general and does not correctly handle all cases. For example, it does not handle the case where \(a\) and \(b\) are such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) in a systematic way.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the problem's requirements for all cases. The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not align with the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Correctness: **False**
