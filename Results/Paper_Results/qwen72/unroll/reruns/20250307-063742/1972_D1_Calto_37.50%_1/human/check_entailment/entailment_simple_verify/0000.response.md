Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. The annotations are correct in this part.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - The logic in this function is flawed. The function attempts to count pairs \((a, b)\) but the formula used does not match the problem description.
   - The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` is not derived from the problem statement and does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
- For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the correct output should be 3, as the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
- However, the provided function `func_2(2, 3)` returns 2, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    result = count_valid_pairs(n, m)
    print(result)
```

### Verification:
- For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
  - Pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\)
  - \(1 + 1\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1)\) (1 is a multiple of 1).
  - \(2 + 1\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1)\) (3 is a multiple of 1).
  - \(2 + 2\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2)\) (4 is a multiple of 4).
  - The correct count is 3.

The original program does not produce the correct output for the given test cases and does not follow the logic required by the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

Final: **False**
