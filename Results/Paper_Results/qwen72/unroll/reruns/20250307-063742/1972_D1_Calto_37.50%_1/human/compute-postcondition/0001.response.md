The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 1, because `range(1, m)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to, but not including, `m`. If `m` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute. 

Before the loop starts, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and `cnt` is 0. For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 1, and `i` should start at 1, which is already the case as defined by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
