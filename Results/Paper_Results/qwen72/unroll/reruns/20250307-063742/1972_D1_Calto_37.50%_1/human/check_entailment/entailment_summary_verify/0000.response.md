### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. The function is implemented correctly and matches the expected behavior for GCD calculation.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - The logic in this function is indeed incorrect. The function attempts to count pairs \((a, b)\) but the formula used does not align with the problem statement.
   - The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` is not derived from the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This formula seems to be an arbitrary attempt to count pairs, which does not correctly handle the required condition.
   - The additional `+ (i > 1)` in the update of `cnt` is also not justified by the problem statement and does not contribute to the correct solution.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
- For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the correct output should be 3, as the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
- However, the provided function `func_2(2, 3)` returns 2, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done using a nested loop, but given the constraints, a more efficient approach is needed.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The function `func_2` is incorrect and needs to be revised.

Final: **False**
