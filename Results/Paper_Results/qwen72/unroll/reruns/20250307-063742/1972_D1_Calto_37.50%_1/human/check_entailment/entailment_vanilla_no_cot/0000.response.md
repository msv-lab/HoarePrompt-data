Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This is fine.

2. **Pair Counting**:
   - The function `func_2(n, m)` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - However, the logic inside `func_2` is incorrect. The variables `x` and `y` are calculated as `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, and then `cnt` is updated as `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`.
   - This logic does not correctly check the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Instead, it seems to be performing some unrelated arithmetic operations.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

# Function to calculate GCD
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

# Function to count valid pairs
def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **GCD Calculation**: The `gcd` function is used to compute the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
- **Pair Counting**: The `count_valid_pairs` function iterates over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges and checks if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. If it is, the count is incremented.
- **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `m` and printing the result of `count_valid_pairs(n, m)`.

This corrected program should correctly solve the problem as described.
