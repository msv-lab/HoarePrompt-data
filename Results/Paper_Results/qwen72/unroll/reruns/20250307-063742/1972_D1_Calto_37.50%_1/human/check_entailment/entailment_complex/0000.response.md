### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**: We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
   - \(1 \le a \le n\)
   - \(1 \le b \le m\)
   - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The function returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function iterates over `i` from 1 to `m-1`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `x` and `y` as follows:
     - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
     - `y = i * i`
   - It then updates `cnt` by adding the integer division of `x` by `y` and an additional 1 if `i > 1`.
   - Finally, if `cnt` is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

4. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - The logic in `func_2` does not directly align with the problem's requirement. Specifically, the problem requires us to count pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation in `func_2` does not involve the GCD calculation or the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be performing some unrelated arithmetic operations and counting based on those operations.
   - The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not appear to be derived from the problem's conditions. Therefore, the function `func_2` is not correctly implementing the required logic.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1` is correct for computing the GCD.
   - However, `func_2` is not correctly implementing the logic to count the pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
