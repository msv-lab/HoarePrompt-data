The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers with the constraint that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function has two possible return values:

- **Case_1:** The function returns 1.
- **Case_2:** The function returns the updated value of `cnt`, which is calculated as `n` plus the sum of integer divisions of `n - i * (i - 1)` by `i * i` for `i` ranging from 1 to `m-1`, plus the number of iterations where `i > 1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It returns 1 in one case. In another case, it returns an updated value of `cnt`, which is `n` plus the sum of integer divisions of `n - i * (i - 1)` by `i * i` for `i` from 1 to `m-1`, plus the number of iterations where `i > 1`.**
