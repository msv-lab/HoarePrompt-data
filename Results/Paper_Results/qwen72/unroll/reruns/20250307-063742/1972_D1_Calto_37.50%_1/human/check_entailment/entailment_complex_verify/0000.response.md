Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. The annotations confirm that the function returns the GCD of the initial values of \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - The logic in this function is indeed incorrect. The function attempts to count pairs \((a, b)\) but the formula used does not match the problem statement.
   - The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` is not derived from the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be an arbitrary calculation that does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to \(m-1\), and for each iteration, it updates `cnt` by adding the integer division of `n - i * (i - 1)` by `i * i` and an additional 1 if `i > 1`. This does not correctly handle the condition specified in the problem.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
- For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the correct output should be 3, as the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
- However, the provided function `func_2(2, 3)` returns 2, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The correct implementation would involve:
1. Iterating over all \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
2. For each \(a\), iterating over all \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
3. For each pair \((a, b)\), computing \(\gcd(a, b)\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Counting the number of valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and the original assessment is correct in identifying the program as incorrect.

Final: **False**
