Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It is a standard and correct implementation of the GCD function.
   - **func_2**: This function is intended to solve the problem, but its logic does not align with the problem requirements. Let's break down the logic:
     - The loop iterates from \(1\) to \(m-1\).
     - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\).
     - It updates `cnt` by adding `x // y` and an additional 1 if \(i > 1\).
     - If `cnt` is 0 after the loop, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

3. **Logical Analysis**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer \(k\). This implies:
     \[
     \frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} = k
     \]
     which simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{a}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} + \frac{1}{\gcd(a, b)} = k
     \]
     or:
     \[
     \frac{a}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} + \frac{1}{\gcd(a, b)} \text{ must be an integer}
     \]
   - The logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement this condition. It uses a formula that does not directly relate to the problem's requirements. Specifically, the expression `n - (i * i - i)` and `i * i` do not align with the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\), the correct pairs are:
     \[
     (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)
     \]
     - The function `func_2` does not correctly count these pairs. It uses a different and incorrect formula to calculate `cnt`.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
