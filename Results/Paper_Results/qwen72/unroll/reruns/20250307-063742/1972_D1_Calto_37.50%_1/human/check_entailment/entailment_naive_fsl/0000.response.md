Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Case Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - The logic in this function is incorrect. The function attempts to count pairs \((a, b)\) but the formula used does not match the problem description.
   - The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` is not derived from the problem statement and does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
- For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the correct output should be 3, as the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
- However, the provided function `func_2(2, 3)` returns 2, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and therefore, it is incorrect.
