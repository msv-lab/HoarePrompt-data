### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program and the original assessment based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`
- **Summary**: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
- **Code**:
  ```python
  def func_1(a, b):
      while b:
          (a, b) = (b, a % b)
      return a
  ```
- **Evaluation**: The function is correct and serves its purpose as a GCD calculator.

#### Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`
- **Summary**: The function `func_2` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. It iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\) and updates a counter `cnt` based on some calculations.
- **Code**:
  ```python
  def func_2(n, m):
      cnt = 0
      for i in range(1, m):
          x = n - (i * i - i)
          y = i * i
          cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
      if cnt == 0:
          return 1
      return cnt
  ```
- **Evaluation**:
  1. **Loop Range**:
     - The loop iterates from 1 to \(m-1\), which means it does not consider the pair \((a, m)\). This is incorrect because the problem requires \(1 \le b \le m\).
  2. **Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**:
     - The calculations \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) do not directly relate to the problem's conditions. The correct condition to check is whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
  3. **Update the Counter**:
     - The counter is updated by adding the integer division of \(x\) by \(y\) and an additional 1 if \(i > 1\). This does not check the required condition and is not a valid approach.
  4. **Special Case**:
     - The special case where `cnt == 0` and returning 1 is not justified by the problem statement. It seems to be an ad-hoc addition without a clear reason.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified the issues with the given program:
1. The loop range is incorrect.
2. The calculations for \(x\) and \(y\) do not check the required condition.
3. The special case of returning 1 when `cnt == 0` is not justified.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not properly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) and has an incorrect loop range.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
