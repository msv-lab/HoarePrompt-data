You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b, where b is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`. After the function concludes, the variable `a` holds the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.

    cnt = 0

    return cnt
    #The program returns the updated value of `cnt`, which is `n` plus the sum of integer divisions of `n - i * (i - 1)` by `i * i` for `i` from 1 to `m-1`, plus the number of iterations where `i > 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It calculates a value `cnt` based on a loop that iterates from 1 to `m-1`. For each iteration, it updates `cnt` by adding the integer division of `n - i * (i - 1)` by `i * i` and an additional 1 if `i > 1`. After the loop, if `cnt` is 0, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the final value of `cnt`. The function does not modify the input parameters `n` and `m`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Description:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Program Analysis:

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`
This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. It is a standard and correct implementation of the GCD function.

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
```

#### Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`
This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   cnt = 0
   ```
   This initializes a counter to zero.

2. **Loop over \(b\)**:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, m):
   ```
   This loop iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\). Note that it should iterate up to \(m\) inclusive, so the correct range should be `range(1, m + 1)`.

3. **Calculate \(x\) and \(y\)**:
   ```python
   x = n - (i * i - i)
   y = i * i
   ```
   Here, \(x\) and \(y\) are calculated as follows:
   - \(x = n - (i^2 - i)\)
   - \(y = i^2\)

4. **Update the counter**:
   ```python
   cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
   ```
   This updates the counter by adding the integer division of \(x\) by \(y\) and an additional 1 if \(i > 1\).

5. **Special case for \(cnt == 0\)**:
   ```python
   if cnt == 0:
       return 1
   return cnt
   ```
   If the counter is zero, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the counter.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Loop Range**:
   The loop should iterate from 1 to \(m\) inclusive, but it currently iterates from 1 to \(m-1\). This means the pair \((a, m)\) is never considered, which is incorrect.

2. **Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**:
   The calculation of \(x\) and \(y\) does not seem to directly relate to the problem's conditions. Specifically, \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not being checked correctly.

3. **Special Case**:
   The special case where \(cnt == 0\) and returning 1 is not justified by the problem statement. It seems to be an ad-hoc addition without a clear reason.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not properly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) and has an incorrect loop range.

Correctness: **False**
