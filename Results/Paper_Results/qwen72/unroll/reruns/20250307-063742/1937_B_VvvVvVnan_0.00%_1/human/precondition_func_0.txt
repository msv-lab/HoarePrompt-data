The function should take three parameters: a positive integer t representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n where each n is between 2 and 2 \cdot 10^5, and two lists of binary strings a1 and a2, each of length n, representing the two rows of the grid. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
