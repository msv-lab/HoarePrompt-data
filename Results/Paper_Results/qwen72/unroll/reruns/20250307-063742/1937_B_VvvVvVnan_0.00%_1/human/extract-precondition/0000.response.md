Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: a positive integer t representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n where each n is between 2 and 2 \cdot 10^5, and two lists of binary strings a1 and a2, each of length n, representing the two rows of the grid. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def func_1(t, n_list, a1_list, a2_list):
```

This function will handle multiple test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n_list` is a list of integers `n` for each test case, and `a1_list` and `a2_list` are lists of binary strings representing the rows of the grid for each test case.
