Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Incorrect Check for Prefix and Suffix Maximums**:
   - The condition `if L[0] != 1 or R[0] != N:` is incorrect. The first prefix maximum should always be 1, but the first suffix maximum should be the last index of the permutation, which is `N`. However, the condition `R[0] != N` should be `R[-1] != N` because `R[0]` is the first suffix maximum, not the last.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Overlapping Maximums**:
   - The condition `if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1]):` is incorrect. It should check if the second-to-last prefix maximum and the second suffix maximum are the same, but the indices used are incorrect. It should be `if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1]):`.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Combinations**:
   - The calculation `ans = math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` is incorrect. The correct combination should be `math.comb(N - 2, L[-1] - 2)` because the first and last elements are fixed, and we need to choose positions for the remaining elements.

4. **Incorrect Loop Logic**:
   - The loops for calculating the number of ways to place elements are not correctly handling the positions of the prefix and suffix maximums. The logic should ensure that the elements are placed correctly according to the given indices.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
import math

input = sys.stdin.readline
MOD = 1000000007

def func_1():
    (N, M1, M2) = map(int, input().split())
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    R = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check if the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum are the same
    if L[-1] != R[0]:
        return 0
    
    # Check if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is N
    if L[0] != 1 or R[-1] != N:
        return 0
    
    # Check if the second-to-last prefix maximum and the second suffix maximum are the same
    if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1]):
        return 0
    
    # Initialize the answer with the number of ways to choose positions for the remaining elements
    ans = math.comb(N - 2, len(L) - 2) % MOD
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to place elements in the prefix
    cur = M1 - 2
    nums_left = L[-1] - 2
    i = L[-1] - 1
    while i > 1:
        if i == L[cur]:
            cur -= 1
        else:
            ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
        nums_left -= 1
        i -= 1
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to place elements in the suffix
    nums_left = N - R[0] - 1
    cur = 1
    i = R[0] + 1
    while i < N:
        if i == R[cur]:
            cur += 1
        else:
            ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
        nums_left -= 1
        i += 1
    
    return ans

for _ in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())
```

This corrected version should handle the problem as described and produce the correct output for the given test cases.
