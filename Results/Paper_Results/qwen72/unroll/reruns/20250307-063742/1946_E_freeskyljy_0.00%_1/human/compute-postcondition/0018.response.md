Output State: **`i` is 1, `cur` is 0, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - i - 1`, and `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1, modulo `MOD`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` becomes 1. Therefore, after the loop, `i` will be 1.
- **`cur`**: The loop decrements `cur` by 1 each time `i` equals `L[cur]`. Since `i` starts at `L[-1] - 1` and decreases to 1, `cur` will be decremented from `M1 - 2` down to 0.
- **`nums_left`**: The loop decrements `nums_left` by 1 in each iteration. Since `nums_left` starts at `L[-1] - 2` and `i` is decremented from `L[-1] - 1` to 1, `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - 2 - (L[-1] - 2) = 0` when the loop ends.
- **`ans`**: The loop multiplies `ans` by `nums_left` modulo `MOD` in each iteration where `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`. This means `ans` will be the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1, modulo `MOD`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop is:
- `i` is 1
- `cur` is 0
- `nums_left` is 0
- `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1, modulo `MOD`.
