Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the prefix maximums and suffix maximums overlap in a way that is not accounted for by the current logic. Specifically, the condition `if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1]): return 0` is too restrictive and may incorrectly return 0 for valid cases.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
6 3 3
1 3 6
1 3 6
```
This input should return 1 because the only permutation that satisfies the conditions is `[1, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3]`. However, the program will return 0 because `L[-2] == R[1]` (both are 3), which triggers the incorrect return statement. This is a valid case where the program fails to produce the correct output.
