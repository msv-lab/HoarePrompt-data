### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2`, followed by the lists `L` and `R` which contain the indices of the prefix and suffix maximums, respectively.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to compute the number of suitable permutations and prints the result.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if the last element of `L` (prefix maximums) is equal to the first element of `R` (suffix maximums). If not, it returns 0 because the maximum element must be both a prefix and a suffix maximum. This check is correct and necessary.
   - It also checks if the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`. If either condition is not met, it returns 0 because the first element of the permutation must be a prefix maximum and the last element must be a suffix maximum. This check is also correct and necessary.
   - The program further checks if the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R` when both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1. If they are equal, it returns 0 because this would imply a conflict in the placement of the second maximum element. This check is correct and necessary to avoid invalid permutations.

3. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial combination using `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. This is the number of ways to choose the positions for the elements that are not the global maximum (which is at position `L[-1]`). This calculation is correct and necessary.

4. **Processing Prefix Maximums:**
   - The program iterates from the second-to-last element of `L` to the first element. For each element, it checks if the current index `i` is in `L`. If it is, it moves to the next prefix maximum. If not, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed at the current index, and updates the number of remaining elements. This logic is correct and ensures that the elements are placed in valid positions.

5. **Processing Suffix Maximums:**
   - Similarly, the program iterates from the second element of `R` to the last element. For each element, it checks if the current index `i` is in `R`. If it is, it moves to the next suffix maximum. If not, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed at the current index, and updates the number of remaining elements. This logic is correct and ensures that the elements are placed in valid positions.

6. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The program ensures that all intermediate results are taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to prevent overflow and meet the problem's requirements. This is correct and necessary.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles edge cases where `N = 1` and `M1 = M2 = 1`, returning 1 as expected.
  - It also correctly handles cases where the conditions for prefix and suffix maximums are not met, returning 0 as expected.

- **Logical Flow:**
  - The logical flow of the program is well-structured. It first performs the necessary checks to ensure the validity of the input, then calculates the initial combination, and finally processes the prefix and suffix maximums to compute the final answer.
  - The use of `math.comb` to calculate the binomial coefficient is appropriate and efficient for the given constraints.

- **Modulo Arithmetic:**
  - The program correctly applies modulo arithmetic at each step to ensure that the result does not overflow and remains within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the combination and placement logic is sound.

Final: **True**
