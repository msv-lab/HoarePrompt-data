Output State: **`i = N`, `cur = M2`, `nums_left = 0`, `ans` is the final computed value.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`i = N`**: The loop runs until `i` reaches `N`, so after the loop, `i` will be equal to `N`.
- **`cur = M2`**: The variable `cur` increments every time `i` matches an element in the `R` list. Since the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, and `R` contains `M2` elements, `cur` will be equal to `M2` after the loop.
- **`nums_left = 0`**: `nums_left` starts as `N - R[0] - 1` and decrements by 1 with each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs `N - 1` times, `nums_left` will be 0 after the loop.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` is updated in the loop by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the result modulo `MOD` whenever `i` does not match an element in the `R` list. The final value of `ans` will be the result of these multiplications. If `M1` is greater than 1, `ans` starts as the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1, modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, `ans` starts as the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`. After the loop, `ans` will be the final computed value based on these updates.
