To ensure the `while` loop can execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `i > 1`.

From the given state:
- `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.

For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 1. Therefore, `L[-1] - 1` must be greater than 1, which means `L[-1]` must be greater than 2.

Given that `L[-1]` is the last element of `L`, and it is equal to the first element of `R`, and `R[0]` is `N`, we need to ensure that `N` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `N` is greater than 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer, `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers from the input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`. `M1` is greater than 1, and `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the second-to-last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`. `cur` is `M1 - 2`, and the current value of `cur` is `M1 - 2` because `M1` is greater than 1. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`. `i` is `L[-1] - 1` and must be greater than 1.**
