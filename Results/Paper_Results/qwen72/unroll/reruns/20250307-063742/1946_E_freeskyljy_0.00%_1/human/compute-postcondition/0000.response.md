Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer. Each tuple in `cases` contains five elements: `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), `m_1` (1 ≤ m_1 ≤ n), `m_2` (1 ≤ m_2 ≤ n), `prefix_max_indices` (a list of `m_1` integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n and p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{m_1}), and `suffix_max_indices` (a list of `m_2` integers where 1 ≤ s_i ≤ n and s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{m_2}). The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
