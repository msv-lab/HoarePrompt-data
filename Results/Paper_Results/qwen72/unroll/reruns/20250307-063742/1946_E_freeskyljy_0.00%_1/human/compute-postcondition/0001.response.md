The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `L`. The initial state variables `t`, `cases`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer, `L` is a list of integers.**
