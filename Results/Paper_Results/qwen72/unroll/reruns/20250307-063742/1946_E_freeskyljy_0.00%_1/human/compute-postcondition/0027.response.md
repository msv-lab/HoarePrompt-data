Output State: **The program returns `ans`, which is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1, modulo `MOD`, if `M1` > 1. If `M2` > 1, `ans` is the final computed value, and `i` is `N`, `cur` is `M2`, and `nums_left` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` and `cur` is `M1 - 2`.**
