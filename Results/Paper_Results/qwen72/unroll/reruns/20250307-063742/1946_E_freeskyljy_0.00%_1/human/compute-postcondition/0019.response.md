Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer, `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers from the input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`. Either `M1` is less than or equal to 1, or `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the second-to-last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. If `M1` > 1, `i` is 1, `cur` is 0, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - i - 1`, and `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1, modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, `cur` is `M1 - 2` and `ans` remains the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`.***
