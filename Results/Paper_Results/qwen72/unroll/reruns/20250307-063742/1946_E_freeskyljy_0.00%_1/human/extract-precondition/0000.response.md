It seems there was a mistake in the function definition provided. Based on the problem description, the function should take parameters for the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, the number of suffix maximums, and the lists of indices for the prefix and suffix maximums. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```python
def count_permutations(t, cases):
```

Where `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `m_1`, `m_2`, `prefix_max_indices`, and `suffix_max_indices`.

Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains five elements: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), m_1 (1 ≤ m_1 ≤ n), m_2 (1 ≤ m_2 ≤ n), prefix_max_indices (a list of m_1 integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n and p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{m_1}), and suffix_max_indices (a list of m_2 integers where 1 ≤ s_i ≤ n and s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{m_2}). The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
