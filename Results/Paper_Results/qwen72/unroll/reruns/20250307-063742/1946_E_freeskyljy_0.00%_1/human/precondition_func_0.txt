t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains five elements: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), m_1 (1 ≤ m_1 ≤ n), m_2 (1 ≤ m_2 ≤ n), prefix_max_indices (a list of m_1 integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n and p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{m_1}), and suffix_max_indices (a list of m_2 integers where 1 ≤ s_i ≤ n and s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{m_2}). The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
