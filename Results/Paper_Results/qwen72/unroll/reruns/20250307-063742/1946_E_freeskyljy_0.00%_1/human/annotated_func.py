#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains five elements: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), m_1 (1 ≤ m_1 ≤ n), m_2 (1 ≤ m_2 ≤ n), prefix_max_indices (a list of m_1 integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n and p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{m_1}), and suffix_max_indices (a list of m_2 integers where 1 ≤ s_i ≤ n and s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{m_2}). The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes input data and computes a value based on specific conditions. It accepts no explicit parameters but reads input values `N`, `M1`, and `M2` from `input()`, and two lists `L` and `R` also from `input()`. The function returns 0 if any of the following conditions are met: the last element of `L` is not equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is not 1, or `R[0]` is not `N`. If `M1` and `M2` are both greater than 1 and the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`, it also returns 0. If none of these conditions are met, the function computes a value `ans` which is initially the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`. If `M1` is greater than 1, it modifies `ans` by multiplying it with a product of integers derived from the list `L`, modulo `MOD`. Similarly, if `M2` is greater than 1, it further modifies `ans` by multiplying it with a product of integers derived from the list `R`, modulo `MOD`. The function finally returns the computed value `ans`.
