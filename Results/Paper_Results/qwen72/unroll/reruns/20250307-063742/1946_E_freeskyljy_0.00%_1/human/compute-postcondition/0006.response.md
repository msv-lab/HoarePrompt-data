Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer, `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers from the input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is not 1 or the first element of `R` is not `N`.**
