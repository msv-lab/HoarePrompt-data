### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2`, followed by the lists `L` and `R` which contain the indices of the prefix and suffix maximums, respectively.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to compute the number of suitable permutations and prints the result.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if the last element of `L` (prefix maximums) is equal to the first element of `R` (suffix maximums). If not, it returns 0 because the maximum element must be both a prefix and a suffix maximum.
   - It also checks if the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`. If either condition is not met, it returns 0 because the first element of the permutation must be a prefix maximum and the last element must be a suffix maximum.
   - The program further checks if the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R` when both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1. If they are equal, it returns 0 because this would imply a conflict in the placement of the second maximum element.

3. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial combination using `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. This is the number of ways to choose the positions for the elements that are not the global maximum (which is at position `L[-1]`).

4. **Processing Prefix Maximums:**
   - The program iterates from the second-to-last element of `L` to the first element. For each element, it checks if the current index `i` is in `L`. If it is, it moves to the next prefix maximum. If not, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed at the current index, and updates the number of remaining elements.

5. **Processing Suffix Maximums:**
   - Similarly, the program iterates from the second element of `R` to the last element. For each element, it checks if the current index `i` is in `R`. If it is, it moves to the next suffix maximum. If not, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed at the current index, and updates the number of remaining elements.

6. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The program ensures that all intermediate results are taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to prevent overflow and meet the problem's requirements.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Initial Checks:**
  - The checks for the last element of `L` being equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` being 1, and the first element of `R` being `N` are correct and necessary.
  - The check for the second-to-last element of `L` being equal to the second element of `R` is also correct, as it ensures that there is no conflict in the placement of the second maximum element.

- **Combination Calculation:**
  - The initial combination calculation is correct. It calculates the number of ways to choose the positions for the elements that are not the global maximum.

- **Processing Prefix and Suffix Maximums:**
  - The logic for processing the prefix and suffix maximums is correct. It ensures that the elements are placed in valid positions and updates the answer accordingly.

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The use of modulo `10^9 + 7` is correct and necessary to handle large numbers.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the combination and placement logic is sound.
