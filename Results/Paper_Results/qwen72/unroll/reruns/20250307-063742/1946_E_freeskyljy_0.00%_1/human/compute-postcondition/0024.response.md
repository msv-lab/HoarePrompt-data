The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is `N + 1`, which means the loop will not execute because `N + 1` is not less than `N`.

To ensure the loop executes the first time, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `N`. Since `i` is currently `N + 1`, we can set `i` to `N` or any value less than `N`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer, `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers from the input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`. `M2` is greater than 1. `cur` is 1. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`. `i` is `N - 1`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1, modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`.**
