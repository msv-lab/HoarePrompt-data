### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Checks:**
   - The function reads the input values `N`, `M1`, and `M2` and the lists `L` and `R`.
   - It checks if the last element of `L` is not equal to the first element of `R`. This is a valid check because the last prefix maximum should be the same as the first suffix maximum, which is the maximum element of the permutation.
   - It also checks if `L[0]` is not 1 or `R[0]` is not `N`. This is correct because the first prefix maximum should always be 1 (the smallest element), and the first suffix maximum should always be `N` (the largest element).
   - If `M1` and `M2` are both greater than 1 and the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`, it returns 0. This is a valid check because it ensures that the prefix and suffix maximums do not overlap in a way that would make the permutation impossible.

2. **Initial Computation of `ans`:**
   - The function initializes `ans` as the binomial coefficient `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. This is correct because it represents the number of ways to choose positions for the elements in the permutation up to the last prefix maximum.

3. **Processing Prefix Maximums:**
   - If `M1` is greater than 1, the function iterates backward from the last prefix maximum to the first. For each position that is not a prefix maximum, it multiplies `ans` by the number of remaining elements that can be placed in that position, modulo `MOD`.
   - This is correct because it accounts for the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements in the positions that are not prefix maximums.

4. **Processing Suffix Maximums:**
   - If `M2` is greater than 1, the function iterates forward from the first suffix maximum to the last. For each position that is not a suffix maximum, it multiplies `ans` by the number of remaining elements that can be placed in that position, modulo `MOD`.
   - This is correct because it accounts for the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements in the positions that are not suffix maximums.

5. **Final Return:**
   - The function returns the computed value `ans`, which is the number of valid permutations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Correctness:
Based on the reasoning above, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the edge cases and computes the number of valid permutations using the binomial coefficient and the appropriate modifications for prefix and suffix maximums.

**Correctness: True**
