The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list of `n` integers `a`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only the characters 'L' and 'R'. For each test case, it computes a list `y` of length `n` where each element is derived from the elements of `a` and the characters in `s` using modulo operations with `m`. The final list `y` is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the final state of the function's local variables is undefined, and the only persistent state is the input and the printed output for each test case.
