You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

    #State: The loop processes each test case and prints the resulting list `y` for each test case. The variables `ii`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, `l`, `k`, `q1`, `q2`, and `y` are updated and used within the loop for each test case, but their values are reset or redefined for the next test case. After all iterations of the loop, the final state of these variables is undefined as they are local to the loop and are not retained between test cases. The only persistent state is the input and the printed output for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list of `n` integers `a`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only the characters 'L' and 'R'. For each test case, it computes a list `y` of length `n` where each element is derived from the elements of `a` and the characters in `s` using modulo operations with `m`. The final list `y` is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the final state of the function's local variables is undefined, and the only persistent state is the input and the printed output for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains an integer `t` (number of test cases).
   - Each test case consists of:
     - Two integers `n` and `m` (length of the array and the modulus).
     - An array `a` of `n` integers.
     - A string `s` of `n` characters, each being 'L' or 'R'.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output `n` integers `b_1, b_2, ..., b_n`, where `b_i` is the remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of the array `a` by `m` at the beginning of the execution of the `i`-th command.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Counting 'L' Commands:**
   - The program counts the number of 'L' commands in the string `s` and stores it in `l`.

3. **Initial Product Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `k` with the remainder of the product of the first `l` elements of the array `a` if the last command is 'L', or the remainder of the product of the first `l+1` elements if the last command is 'R'.
   - This is incorrect because the initial product should be the product of all elements in the array `a`.

4. **Output Array Initialization:**
   - The program initializes an output array `y` of length `n` with zeros.

5. **Processing Commands:**
   - The program processes the commands in reverse order (from the last command to the first).
   - For each command:
     - If the command is 'R', it multiplies `k` by the next element from the right and updates `q2`.
     - If the command is 'L', it multiplies `k` by the next element from the left and updates `q1`.
   - This approach is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the product of the remaining elements in the array after each command.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Initial Product Calculation:**
   - Calculate the product of all elements in the array `a` and take the remainder modulo `m`.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - For each command, output the current product modulo `m`.
   - If the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array.
   - If the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array.
   - Update the product by dividing it by the removed element and taking the remainder modulo `m`.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's walk through the first test case:
- **Input:**
  - `n = 4`, `m = 6`
  - `a = [3, 1, 4, 2]`
  - `s = "LRRL"`

- **Initial Product:**
  - `3 * 1 * 4 * 2 = 24`
  - `24 % 6 = 0`

- **Processing Commands:**
  - `s[0] = 'L'`: Remove `3`, new array `[1, 4, 2]`
    - `1 * 4 * 2 = 8`
    - `8 % 6 = 2`
  - `s[1] = 'R'`: Remove `2`, new array `[1, 4]`
    - `1 * 4 = 4`
    - `4 % 6 = 4`
  - `s[2] = 'R'`: Remove `4`, new array `[1]`
    - `1 % 6 = 1`
  - `s[3] = 'L'`: Remove `1`, new array `[]`
    - `0 % 6 = 0`

The correct output for this test case should be `0 2 4 1`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle the initial product calculation and the updating of the product after each command. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
