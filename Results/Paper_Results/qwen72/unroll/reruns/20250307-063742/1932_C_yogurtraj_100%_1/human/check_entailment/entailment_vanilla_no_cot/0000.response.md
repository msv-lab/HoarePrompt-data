Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly process the commands as described in the problem statement. The main issues are:

1. **Product Calculation and Modulo Operation**: The program does not correctly calculate the product of the current elements of the array `a` and then take the modulo `m` for each command. Instead, it seems to be trying to calculate the product in reverse, which is incorrect.

2. **Initialization of `q1` and `q2`**: The variables `q1` and `q2` are initialized incorrectly. The logic for determining the initial values of `q1` and `q2` based on the last command is flawed and does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Handling the Product**: The program does not maintain a running product of the elements in the array `a` as commands are processed. This is necessary to correctly compute the remainder of the product after each command.

4. **Output Order**: The program outputs the results in reverse order, which is not what the problem requires. The results should be output in the order of the commands.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        commands = input().strip()
        
        # Calculate the initial product modulo m
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        # Initialize the result list
        results = [0] * n
        
        # Process each command
        for i in range(n):
            results[i] = product
            if commands[i] == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(a[i], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove the leftmost element
                a.pop(0)
            else:
                product = (product * pow(a[-1], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove the rightmost element
                a.pop()
        
        print(*results)

func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Product Calculation**: The initial product of all elements in the array `a` is calculated and taken modulo `m`.
- **Command Processing**: For each command:
  - The current product modulo `m` is stored in the results list.
  - If the command is 'L', the leftmost element is removed, and the product is updated by multiplying it with the modular inverse of the removed element.
  - If the command is 'R', the rightmost element is removed, and the product is updated similarly.
- **Modular Inverse**: The `pow(a[i], m-2, m)` function is used to compute the modular inverse of `a[i]` under modulo `m` (assuming `m` is a prime number, which is a common assumption in such problems).

This corrected program should handle the problem as specified and produce the correct output for each test case.
