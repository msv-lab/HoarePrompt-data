### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - Each test case reads `n` and `m`, the list `a`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `l` is the count of 'L' commands in the string `s`.
   - `k` is initialized based on the last command in `s`:
     - If the last command is 'L', `k` is set to the last element of the array `a` that will be removed by an 'L' command, modulo `m`.
     - If the last command is 'R', `k` is set to the element of the array `a` that will be removed by the last 'R' command, modulo `m`.

3. **Output List Initialization:**
   - `y` is initialized as a list of zeros of length `n`.

4. **Backward Processing:**
   - The function processes the commands in reverse order, starting from the second-to-last command.
   - For each command:
     - If the command is 'R', it multiplies `k` by the element at the current position `q2` in the array `a` and takes the result modulo `m`.
     - If the command is 'L', it multiplies `k` by the element at the current position `q1` in the array `a` and takes the result modulo `m`.
     - The result is stored in the corresponding position in the list `y`.

5. **Output:**
   - The list `y` is printed for each test case.

### Issues:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `k`:**
   - The initialization of `k` is incorrect. It should be the product of all elements in `a` modulo `m` before any commands are processed.
   - The current initialization only considers the last command and the corresponding element, which is not correct.

2. **Incorrect Indexing:**
   - The variables `q1` and `q2` are used to track the positions of elements to be removed, but they are not correctly initialized or updated.
   - `q1` and `q2` should be initialized to the start and end of the array, respectively, and updated correctly based on the commands.

3. **Product Calculation:**
   - The product of all elements should be calculated initially and updated as elements are removed, rather than just considering the last command.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = input()
        
        # Calculate the initial product modulo m
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        y = [0] * n
        y[0] = product
        
        # Initialize pointers for the array
        left = 0
        right = n - 1
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(a[left], -1, m)) % m
                left += 1
            else:
                product = (product * pow(a[right], -1, m)) % m
                right -= 1
            y[i + 1] = product
        
        print(*y)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Initial Product Calculation:**
   - The initial product of all elements in `a` is calculated and taken modulo `m`.

2. **Modular Inverse:**
   - When an element is removed, the product is updated by multiplying it with the modular inverse of the removed element. This is necessary because division in modular arithmetic is not straightforward and requires the modular inverse.

3. **Pointers for Array:**
   - `left` and `right` pointers are used to track the current positions of the array elements that will be removed.

4. **Output List:**
   - The list `y` is correctly updated with the product modulo `m` at each step.

### Correctness:
**False**

The original program does not correctly initialize the product and does not handle the removal of elements properly. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work as intended.
