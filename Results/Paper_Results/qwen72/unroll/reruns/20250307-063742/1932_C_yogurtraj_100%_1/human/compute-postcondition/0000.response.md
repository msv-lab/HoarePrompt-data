The only objects in the loop head are the variables `ii` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the number of test cases, which is the result of `int(input())`, must be greater than 0. The variable `ii` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the number of test cases is at least 1, and `ii` is 0.

State: **`ii` is 0, the number of test cases (result of `int(input())`) must be greater than 0**
