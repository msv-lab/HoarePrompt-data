### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the list of integers `a`, and the string of commands `t`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function initializes `l` to the count of 'L' commands in the string `t`.
   - It also initializes `k`, `q1`, and `q2` to handle the initial product and indices for the 'L' and 'R' commands.

3. **Initial Product Calculation:**
   - The function correctly calculates the initial product modulo `m` based on the last command in the string `t`.
   - If the last command is 'L', it sets `k` to `a[l - 1] % m` and initializes `q1` and `q2` accordingly.
   - If the last command is 'R', it sets `k` to `a[l] % m` and initializes `q1` and `q2` accordingly.

4. **Output List Initialization:**
   - The function initializes a list `y` of length `n` with zeros.

5. **Processing Commands:**
   - The function iterates backward through the commands in `t` (from `n-2` to `0`).
   - For each command 'R', it updates `k` by multiplying it with the element at index `q2` and then increments `q2`.
   - For each command 'L', it updates `k` by multiplying it with the element at index `q1` and then decrements `q1`.
   - It correctly stores the updated `k` in the list `y`.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the list `y` for each test case, which contains the remainders of the product of the current state of the array `a` modulo `m` at the beginning of each command execution.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Initial Product Calculation:**
  - The initial product calculation is incorrect. The product should be calculated for all elements in the array `a` before any commands are processed.
  - The function only sets `k` to the last element based on the last command, which is not the correct initial product.

- **Incorrect Index Handling:**
  - The indices `q1` and `q2` are not correctly set to handle the removal of elements from the array `a` based on the commands.
  - The function should maintain a running product and update it correctly as elements are removed.

### Correctness:
- **False**

The function does not correctly calculate the initial product of the array `a` and does not handle the indices properly for removing elements based on the commands. Therefore, the output will be incorrect for most test cases.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        t = input()
        
        # Calculate the initial product modulo m
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        # Initialize the output list
        y = [0] * n
        
        # Process the commands
        for i in range(n):
            y[i] = product
            if t[i] == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(a[i], -1, m)) % m
                a.pop(0)
            else:
                product = (product * pow(a[-1], -1, m)) % m
                a.pop()
        
        print(*y)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initial Product Calculation:**
  - The initial product of all elements in `a` is calculated and stored in `product`.
- **Processing Commands:**
  - For each command, the current product is stored in `y`.
  - If the command is 'L', the leftmost element is removed from `a` and the product is updated by multiplying with the modular inverse of the removed element.
  - If the command is 'R', the rightmost element is removed from `a` and the product is updated similarly.
- **Output:**
  - The list `y` is printed for each test case, containing the correct remainders of the product of the current state of the array `a` modulo `m` at the beginning of each command execution.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
