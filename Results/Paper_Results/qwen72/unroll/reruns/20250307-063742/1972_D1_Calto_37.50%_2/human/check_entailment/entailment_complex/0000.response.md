Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
   - \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\)
   - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The function returns the GCD of `a` and `b`, which is essential for the problem since we need to use \(\gcd(a, b)\) in the condition.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function iterates over `i` from 1 to `m-1`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `x` and `y` as follows:
     - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
     - `y = i * i`
   - It then adds `x // y` to `cnt` and an additional 1 if `i > 1`.
   - Finally, it returns `cnt` if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise it returns 1.

4. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer \(k\).
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - For \(a\) to be a positive integer, \(k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1\) must be a positive integer, and \(a\) must be in the range \([1, n]\).

5. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code in `func_2` does not directly follow the logic derived from the problem statement. Specifically, the calculation of `x` and `y` and the subsequent addition to `cnt` does not seem to correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not align with the derived condition \(a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)\).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is incorrect and does not match the problem's requirements.
   - The function `func_1` is correct for computing the GCD, but it is not used appropriately in `func_2`.

Correctness: **False**
