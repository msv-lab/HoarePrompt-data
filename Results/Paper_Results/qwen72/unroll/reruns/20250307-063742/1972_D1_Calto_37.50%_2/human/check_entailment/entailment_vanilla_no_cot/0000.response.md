Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` is flawed. The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` but the formula used to compute `x` and `y` does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Explanation:
- **Problem Statement**: We need to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
  - \(1 \le a \le n\)
  - \(1 \le b \le m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

- **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.

- **Function `func_2`**: This function is supposed to count the valid pairs, but the logic inside the loop is incorrect. The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not correctly represent the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m` and for each `b`, count the number of valid `a` values from 1 to `n` that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

This program correctly iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, this approach might be too slow for large inputs (up to \(2 \cdot 10^6\)). A more efficient approach would be needed to handle such large inputs within a reasonable time.
