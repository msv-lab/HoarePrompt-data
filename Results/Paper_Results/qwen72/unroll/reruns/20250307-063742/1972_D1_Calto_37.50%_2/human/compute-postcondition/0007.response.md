The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers with the constraint that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: The function returns 1.
- **Case_2**: The function returns the value of `cnt`, which is calculated as the sum of `x // y` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, plus the number of iterations where `i > 1` and `cnt` is not equal to 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It returns 1 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of `x // y` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, plus the number of iterations where `i > 1` and `cnt` is not equal to 0.**
