The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 1, because `range(1, m)` will generate numbers from 1 to `m-1`. Before the loop starts, `cnt` is 0, but this does not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 1 and `i` is set to 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1**
