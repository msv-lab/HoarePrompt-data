Output State: **`cnt` is the sum of `x // y` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, plus the number of iterations where `i > 1`.**

To break this down:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = m-1`.
- For each iteration, `x` is calculated as `n - (i * i - i)`, and `y` is calculated as `i * i`.
- `cnt` is updated by adding `x // y` and 1 if `i > 1`.
- The final value of `cnt` is the sum of all these updates over the iterations.
