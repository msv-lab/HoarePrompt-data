### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in stating that the given program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the program and the annotations to understand why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The state annotations for `func_1` are accurate:
     - Before the function call: \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
     - After the function call: \(a\) is the GCD of the initial values of \(a\) and \(b\), and \(b\) is 0.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - However, the logic in `func_2` is flawed:
     - The loop iterates from \(i = 1\) to \(i = m-1\).
     - Inside the loop, `x` is calculated as \(n - (i \cdot i - i)\).
     - `y` is calculated as \(i \cdot i\).
     - The count `cnt` is incremented by `x // y + (i > 1)`.
     - This logic does not align with the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the correct output should be 3, as the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
   - Let's trace the execution of `func_2(2, 3)`:
     - For \(i = 1\):
       - \(x = 2 - (1 \cdot 1 - 1) = 2\)
       - \(y = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\)
       - `cnt = 0 + 2 // 1 + (1 > 1) = 2`
     - For \(i = 2\):
       - \(x = 2 - (2 \cdot 2 - 2) = 2 - 2 = 0\)
       - \(y = 2 \cdot 2 = 4\)
       - `cnt = 2 + 0 // 4 + (2 > 1) = 3`
     - The function returns 3, which is incorrect because it should return 3.

4. **Flaws in `func_2`**:
   - The calculation of `x` and `y` does not correctly represent the conditions \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The increment of `cnt` by `x // y + (i > 1)` is not aligned with the problem's requirements.
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly identify valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

Final: **False**
