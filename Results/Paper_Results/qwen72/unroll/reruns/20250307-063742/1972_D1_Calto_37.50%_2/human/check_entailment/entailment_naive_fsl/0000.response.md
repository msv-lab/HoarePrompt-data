Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

For example, consider the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\). The correct output should be 3, as the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\). However, the function `func_2(2, 3)` returns 2, which is incorrect.

The logic in `func_2` seems to be flawed and does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the calculation of `x` and `y` and the way the count is incremented do not align with the required conditions.
