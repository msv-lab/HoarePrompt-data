Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is correct and returns the GCD of the given inputs.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - `func_2(n, m)` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions.
   - The function iterates over `i` from 1 to `m-1`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
   - It then adds `x // y` to `cnt` and increments `cnt` by 1 if `i > 1`.
   - If `cnt` is 0 after the loop, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

4. **Checking the Logic in `func_2`:**
   - The logic in `func_2` does not seem to correctly implement the conditions of the problem.
   - Specifically, the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not being checked.
   - The expressions `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not directly relate to the problem's conditions.
   - The loop and the way `cnt` is incremented do not align with the requirement to count pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

5. **Expected Logic:**
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be done by iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking the condition for each pair.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem as described.
   - The function `func_2` is not correctly counting the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

Correctness: **False**
