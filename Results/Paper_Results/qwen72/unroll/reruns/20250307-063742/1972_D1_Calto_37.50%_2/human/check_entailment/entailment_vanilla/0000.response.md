Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Key Observations:
1. **GCD Property**: For any pair \((a, b)\), \(\gcd(a, b)\) is the greatest common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\).
2. **Multiple Condition**: \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be written as:
   \[
   a + b = k \cdot (b \cdot \gcd(a, b))
   \]
   for some integer \(k\).

### Simplification:
1. Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\).
2. Substituting \(a\) and \(b\) in the multiple condition:
   \[
   d \cdot a' + d \cdot b' = k \cdot (d \cdot b' \cdot d)
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   d \cdot (a' + b') = k \cdot d^2 \cdot b'
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \(d\):
   \[
   a' + b' = k \cdot d \cdot b'
   \]
   Since \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\), \(a' + b'\) must be a multiple of \(b'\).

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **func_2(n, m)**: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

Let's examine **func_2(n, m)**:
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
- It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
- For each \(i\), it calculates:
  \[
  x = n - (i \cdot i - i)
  \]
  \[
  y = i \cdot i
  \]
- It updates the counter `cnt` by:
  \[
  cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
  \]
- If `cnt` is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Iteration Range**: The loop iterates from 1 to \(m-1\), but it should iterate from 1 to \(m\).
2. **Incorrect Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**: The expressions \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\) do not seem to be related to the problem's conditions. The correct approach should involve checking the multiple condition for each pair \((a, b)\).
3. **Incorrect Logic for Counting**: The logic for counting valid pairs is flawed. It does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. For each \(b\), iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the program, it does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
