You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

        (a, b) = (b, a % b)

- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b, and b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b, where b is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`. After the function concludes, the value of `b` is 0, and `a` holds the GCD of the initial inputs.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: `cnt` is the sum of `x // y` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, plus the number of iterations where `i > 1`.
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: *`cnt` is the sum of `x // y` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, plus the number of iterations where `i > 1`, and `cnt` is not equal to 0
    return cnt
    #The program returns the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of `x // y` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, plus the number of iterations where `i > 1`, and `cnt` is not equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It calculates a value `cnt` which is the sum of `x // y` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, where `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, plus the number of iterations where `i > 1`. If `cnt` is 0, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the value of `cnt`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Key Observations:
1. **GCD Property**: For any pair \((a, b)\), \(\gcd(a, b)\) is the greatest common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\).
2. **Multiple Condition**: \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be written as:
   \[
   a + b = k \cdot (b \cdot \gcd(a, b))
   \]
   for some integer \(k\).

### Simplification:
1. Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\).
2. Substituting \(a\) and \(b\) in the multiple condition:
   \[
   d \cdot a' + d \cdot b' = k \cdot (d \cdot b' \cdot d)
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   d \cdot (a' + b') = k \cdot d^2 \cdot b'
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \(d\):
   \[
   a' + b' = k \cdot d \cdot b'
   \]
   Since \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\), \(a' + b'\) must be a multiple of \(b'\).

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **func_2(n, m)**: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

Let's examine **func_2(n, m)**:
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
- It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
- For each \(i\), it calculates:
  \[
  x = n - (i \cdot i - i)
  \]
  \[
  y = i \cdot i
  \]
- It updates the counter `cnt` by:
  \[
  cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
  \]
- If `cnt` is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Iteration Range**: The loop iterates from 1 to \(m-1\), but it should iterate from 1 to \(m\).
2. **Incorrect Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**: The expressions \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\) do not seem to be related to the problem's conditions. The correct approach should involve checking the multiple condition for each pair \((a, b)\).
3. **Incorrect Logic for Counting**: The logic for counting valid pairs is flawed. It does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. For each \(b\), iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the program, it does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
