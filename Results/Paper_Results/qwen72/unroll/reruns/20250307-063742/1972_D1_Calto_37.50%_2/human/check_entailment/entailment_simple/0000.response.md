### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The function correctly returns the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Function 2:**
   - The function `func_2(n, m)` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
   - Inside the loop:
     - `x = n - (i * i - i)` is calculated.
     - `y = i * i` is calculated.
     - `cnt` is incremented by `x // y + (i > 1)`.
   - If `cnt` is 0, the function returns 1.
   - Otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

4. **Analysis of the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\), which means \(b\) ranges from 1 to \(m-1\).
   - For each \(i\), `x` is calculated as \(n - (i * i - i)\).
   - `y` is calculated as \(i * i\).
   - `cnt` is incremented by `x // y + (i > 1)`.
   - The term `x // y` is the integer division of `x` by `y`.
   - The term `(i > 1)` adds 1 to `cnt` if \(i\) is greater than 1.

5. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The calculation of `x` and `y` and the increment of `cnt` do not reflect the required condition.
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) should be checked for each pair \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).

6. **Example Verification:**
   - For the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the valid pairs are:
     - (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2).
   - The program should return 14 for this test case.
   - The current implementation does not correctly count these pairs.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
