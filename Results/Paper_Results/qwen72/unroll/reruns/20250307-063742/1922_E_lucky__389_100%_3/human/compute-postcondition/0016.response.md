To determine what will be printed by the `print()` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- The loop prints all integers from 0 to `mx` - 1.
- It then prints all elements in `subseq_lens` starting from index 1.
- The variables `mx` and `ansv` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print()
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop prints integers from 0 to `mx` - 1, followed by elements in `subseq_lens` starting from index 1.
   - This means the loop will produce a sequence of numbers, but the `print()` statement in the code snippet is outside the loop and is executed after the loop has completed.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print()` statement is empty, meaning it does not contain any arguments.
   - An empty `print()` statement simply prints a newline character, which moves the cursor to the next line without printing any additional content.

### Conclusion:
The `print()` statement will print a newline character, effectively moving the cursor to the next line.

Output: **(a newline character)**
