You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. If there are multiple valid arrays, any one of them can be returned. All elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: - The `print` statement will print the integer `1`.
        #
        #Output:
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program returns None.
    #State: *`mx` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, and `x` is not equal to 2
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: `mx` is the largest integer `i` such that `2
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `mx` remains the same, and `ansv` is now a list containing integers from 0 to `mx` - 1 followed by all elements in `subseq_lens` starting from index 1.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: mx + (len(subseq_lens) - 1) (where mx is the value of mx and len(subseq_lens) is the length of the subseq_lens list)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: The loop prints all integers from 0 to `mx` - 1 followed by all elements in `subseq_lens` starting from index 1, separated by spaces. The variables `mx` and `ansv` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` is designed to accept a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) and return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. If no such array exists, the function returns -1. All elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. If there are multiple valid arrays, any one of them can be returned.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
