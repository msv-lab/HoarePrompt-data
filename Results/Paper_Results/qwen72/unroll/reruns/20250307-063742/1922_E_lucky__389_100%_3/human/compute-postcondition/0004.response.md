Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mx` is 0.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `subseq_lens` is an empty list.
   - `x` is equal to 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `1`.
   - The values of `mx`, `x`, and `subseq_lens` are not used in the `print` statement, so they do not affect the output.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
