### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array, in the same order, where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - The array should be constructed such that it meets the criteria for the number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the integer \( x \) which represents the number of increasing subsequences required.
   - It initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of subsequences.
   - It also initializes a variable `mx` to keep track of the maximum length of the subsequences.
   - If \( x \) is 2, it prints a single-element array `[0]` and returns, which is correct because a single-element array has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element.
   - The program then enters a loop to decompose \( x \) into powers of 2. This is based on the idea that the number of increasing subsequences can be represented as a sum of powers of 2.
   - For each power of 2 found, it appends the corresponding exponent (i - 1) to `subseq_lens` and subtracts \( 2^{(i-1)} \) from \( x \).
   - It updates `mx` to the maximum exponent found.
   - After the loop, it constructs the array `ansv` by first adding integers from 0 to `mx - 1`.
   - It then appends the elements from `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach of decomposing \( x \) into powers of 2 is correct because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of powers of 2.
   - The construction of `ansv` ensures that the array has the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The length of `ansv` is at most 200 because the maximum number of elements added to `ansv` is the number of distinct powers of 2 up to \( 2^{18} \) (since \( 2^{18} \) is the largest power of 2 less than \( 10^{18} \)), which is 19, plus the initial `mx` elements, which is also at most 19.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( x \) is 2.
   - The program should handle cases where \( x \) is a power of 2 or a sum of distinct powers of 2.
   - The program should also handle cases where \( x \) is not a sum of distinct powers of 2, which is not possible according to the problem constraints.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the length of the array and the elements of the array, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its approach and implementation. It correctly decomposes \( x \) into powers of 2 and constructs the array to have exactly \( x \) increasing subsequences.

Correctness: **True**
