### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Call**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the integer `x` for each test case.
   - It initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` and a variable `mx` to 0.

3. **Special Case for `x == 2`**:
   - If `x` is 2, the function prints `1` and `0` and returns. This is correct because the array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `x` becomes 0.
   - Inside the loop, it finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` and appends the exponent to `subseq_lens`.
   - It then subtracts this power of 2 from `x` and updates `mx` to be the maximum of `mx` and the exponent.
   - This process ensures that `x` is decomposed into a sum of distinct powers of 2, which is a valid representation of any positive integer.

5. **Constructing the Answer Array**:
   - After the loop, `subseq_lens` contains the exponents of the powers of 2 that sum up to `x`.
   - The program constructs the answer array `ansv` by first adding integers from 0 to `mx - 1`.
   - It then appends the elements of `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 to `ansv`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of `ansv`.
   - It then prints the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces.

### Analysis of Correctness:
- **Subsequence Count**:
  - The number of increasing subsequences of an array of distinct integers is \(2^n - 1\) where `n` is the length of the array.
  - By appending the exponents of the powers of 2 to `subseq_lens`, the program ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `x`.
  - The construction of `ansv` ensures that the array has the required number of increasing subsequences.

- **Array Length**:
  - The length of `ansv` is `mx + (len(subseq_lens) - 1)`, which is at most 200 for valid inputs of `x` up to \(10^{18}\).

- **Element Range**:
  - The elements of `ansv` are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), which is valid.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and produces the expected output for the given test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
