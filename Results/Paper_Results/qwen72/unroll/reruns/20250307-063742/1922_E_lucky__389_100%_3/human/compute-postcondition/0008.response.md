The only variables in the loop head are `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 2. However, the condition for the loop to execute is that `x` must not be 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `x` is not 0.

State: **`mx` is 0, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be 0, `subseq_lens` is an empty list**
