Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) and prints an array of integers that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. If `X` is 2, the function prints `1` followed by `0` and returns `None`. For other values of `X`, the function constructs an array `ansv` such that the length of `ansv` is at most 200, and all elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. The function then prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces, and finally a newline. The function always returns `None`. **
