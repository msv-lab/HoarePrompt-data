The function `solve` is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should either return -1 if no valid array exists, or return a positive integer n (n ≤ 200) followed by a list of n integers, where the integers are in the range [-10^9, 10^9] and the array has exactly X increasing subsequences.
