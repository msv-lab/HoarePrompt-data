#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. If there are multiple valid arrays, any one of them can be returned. All elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: - The `print` statement will print the integer `1`.
        #
        #Output:
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program returns None.
    #State: *`mx` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, and `x` is not equal to 2
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: `mx` is the largest integer `i` such that `2
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `mx` remains the same, and `ansv` is now a list containing integers from 0 to `mx` - 1 followed by all elements in `subseq_lens` starting from index 1.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: mx + (len(subseq_lens) - 1) (where mx is the value of mx and len(subseq_lens) is the length of the subseq_lens list)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: The loop prints all integers from 0 to `mx` - 1 followed by all elements in `subseq_lens` starting from index 1, separated by spaces. The variables `mx` and `ansv` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) and prints an array of integers that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. If `X` is 2, the function prints `1` followed by `0` and returns `None`. For other values of `X`, the function constructs an array `ansv` such that the length of `ansv` is at most 200, and all elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. The function then prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces, and finally a newline. The function always returns `None`.
