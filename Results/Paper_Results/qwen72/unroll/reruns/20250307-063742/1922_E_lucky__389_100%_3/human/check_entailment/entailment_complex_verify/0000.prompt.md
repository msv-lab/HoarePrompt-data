You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. If there are multiple valid arrays, any one of them can be returned. All elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].

    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: - The `print` statement will print the integer `1`.
        #
        #Output:
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program returns None.
    #State: *`mx` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, and `x` is not equal to 2
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: `mx` is the largest integer `i` such that `2
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `mx` remains the same, and `ansv` is now a list containing integers from 0 to `mx` - 1 followed by all elements in `subseq_lens` starting from index 1.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: mx + (len(subseq_lens) - 1) (where mx is the value of mx and len(subseq_lens) is the length of the subseq_lens list)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: The loop prints all integers from 0 to `mx` - 1 followed by all elements in `subseq_lens` starting from index 1, separated by spaces. The variables `mx` and `ansv` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) and prints an array of integers that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. If `X` is 2, the function prints `1` followed by `0` and returns `None`. For other values of `X`, the function constructs an array `ansv` such that the length of `ansv` is at most 200, and all elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. The function then prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces, and finally a newline. The function always returns `None`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when `x` is a power of 2. For example, when `x = 4`, the program should output an array that has exactly 4 increasing subsequences. However, the program incorrectly outputs an array that does not meet this requirement. Let's break down the issue:

1. When `x = 4`, the program enters the loop and finds that `2 ** 2 <= 4`. It then appends `1` to `subseq_lens` and subtracts `2 ** 1` from `x`, leaving `x = 2`.
2. In the next iteration, it finds that `2 ** 1 <= 2`. It then appends `0` to `subseq_lens` and subtracts `2 ** 0` from `x`, leaving `x = 1`.
3. In the final iteration, it finds that `2 ** 0 <= 1`. It then appends `0` to `subseq_lens` and subtracts `2 ** 0` from `x`, leaving `x = 0`.

The resulting `subseq_lens` is `[1, 0, 0]`, and the program constructs the array `[0, 1, 0]`. However, this array has more than 4 increasing subsequences, which is incorrect. The correct output should be an array that has exactly 4 increasing subsequences, such as `[0, 1, 2, 0]`.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
