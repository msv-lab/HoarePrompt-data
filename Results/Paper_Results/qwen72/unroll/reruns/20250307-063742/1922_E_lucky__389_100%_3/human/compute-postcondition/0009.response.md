Output State: **`mx` is the largest integer `i` such that `2 ** i` is less than or equal to the initial value of `x`, `x` is 0, and `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the sequence of `i - 1` values where `2 ** (i - 1)` is subtracted from `x` until `x` becomes 0.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing:
- `mx` will hold the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the initial value of `x`.
- `x` will be 0, as the loop continues to subtract powers of 2 from `x` until `x` is reduced to 0.
- `subseq_lens` will be a list containing the sequence of exponents (each reduced by 1) of the powers of 2 that were subtracted from `x` during the loop.
