Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `mx` remains the same.
- `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx - 1` followed by all elements in `subseq_lens` starting from index 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `ansv`**:
   - The list `ansv` is constructed by first adding integers from 0 to `mx - 1`.
   - Then, it appends all elements from the list `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 (i.e., all elements except the first one).

2. **Length of `ansv`**:
   - The length of the list of integers from 0 to `mx - 1` is `mx`.
   - The length of the sublist of `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`.

3. **Total Length of `ansv`**:
   - The total length of `ansv` is the sum of the lengths of the two parts:
     \[
     \text{len(ansv)} = mx + (len(subseq_lens) - 1)
     \]

### Final Output:
The `print(len(ansv))` statement will print the total length of the list `ansv`, which is the sum of `mx` and the length of `subseq_lens` minus 1.

Output: **mx + (len(subseq_lens) - 1) (where mx is the value of mx and len(subseq_lens) is the length of the subseq_lens list)**
