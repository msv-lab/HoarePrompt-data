Functionality: **The function `func_1` is designed to accept a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) and return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. If no such array exists, the function returns -1. All elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. If there are multiple valid arrays, any one of them can be returned.**
