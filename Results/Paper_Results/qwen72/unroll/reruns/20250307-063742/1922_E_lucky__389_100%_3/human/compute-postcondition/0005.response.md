The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `0`. The initial state of the program is as follows:
- `mx` is 0
- `x` is an input integer and is explicitly set to 2
- `subseq_lens` is an empty list

The `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or objects. It simply prints the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
