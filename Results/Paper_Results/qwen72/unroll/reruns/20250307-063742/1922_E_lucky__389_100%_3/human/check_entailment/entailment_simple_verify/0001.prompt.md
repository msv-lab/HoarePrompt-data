You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array, in the same order, where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - The array should be constructed such that it meets the criteria for the number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the integer \( x \) which represents the number of increasing subsequences required.
   - It initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of subsequences.
   - It also initializes a variable `mx` to keep track of the maximum length of the subsequences.
   - If \( x \) is 2, it prints a single-element array `[0]` and returns, which is correct because a single-element array has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element.
   - The program then enters a loop to decompose \( x \) into powers of 2. This is based on the idea that the number of increasing subsequences can be represented as a sum of powers of 2.
   - For each power of 2 found, it appends the corresponding exponent (i - 1) to `subseq_lens` and subtracts \( 2^{(i-1)} \) from \( x \).
   - It updates `mx` to the maximum exponent found.
   - After the loop, it constructs the array `ansv` by first adding integers from 0 to `mx - 1`.
   - It then appends the elements from `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach of decomposing \( x \) into powers of 2 is correct because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of powers of 2.
   - The construction of `ansv` ensures that the array has the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The length of `ansv` is at most 200 because the maximum number of elements added to `ansv` is the number of distinct powers of 2 up to \( 2^{18} \) (since \( 2^{18} \) is the largest power of 2 less than \( 10^{18} \)), which is 19, plus the initial `mx` elements, which is also at most 19.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( x \) is 2.
   - The program should handle cases where \( x \) is a power of 2 or a sum of distinct powers of 2.
   - The program should also handle cases where \( x \) is not a sum of distinct powers of 2, which is not possible according to the problem constraints.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the length of the array and the elements of the array, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its approach and implementation. It correctly decomposes \( x \) into powers of 2 and constructs the array to have exactly \( x \) increasing subsequences.

Correctness: **True**
