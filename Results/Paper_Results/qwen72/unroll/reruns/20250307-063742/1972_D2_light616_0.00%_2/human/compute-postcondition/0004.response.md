The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The function assumes that `func_1` is defined and can handle the input and output as described in the problem. The output of `func_2` is not specified, so it is unclear what the function returns. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that `func_2` likely calls `func_1` and may return a value or perform an action based on the result of `func_1`.
