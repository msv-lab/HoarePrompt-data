Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, and then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. The function does not return any value, and it does not modify any variables or state outside of its scope. The primary purpose of `func_2` is to execute `func_1` a specified number of times based on user input. **
