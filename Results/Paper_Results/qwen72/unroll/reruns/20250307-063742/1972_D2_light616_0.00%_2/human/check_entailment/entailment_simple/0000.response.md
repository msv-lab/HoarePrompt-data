### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case. This correctly handles the input as described in the problem statement.

2. **Pair Generation and Conditions**:
   - `func_1` reads `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - The outer loop runs while `x * x <= n`, which ensures that `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
   - The inner loop runs while `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`, which ensures that both `a` and `b` are within the bounds `[1, n]` and `[1, m]` respectively.
   - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` checks if `x` and `y` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).

3. **Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - The program increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for each valid pair `(x, y)`.
   - This is intended to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `a = (x + y) * x` and `b = (x + y) * y` and `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loops, `func_1` prints `cnt`, which is the count of valid pairs for the given `n` and `m`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` and `m` are both 1, correctly outputting 0.
   - The program also handles larger values of `n` and `m` as shown in the example.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a nested loop, which is efficient enough given the constraints (neither the sum of `n` nor the sum of `m` over all test cases exceeds `2 * 10^6`).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions. The input and output handling is also correct. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
