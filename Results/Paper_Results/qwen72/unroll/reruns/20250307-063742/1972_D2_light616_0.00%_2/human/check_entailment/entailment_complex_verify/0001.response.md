### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\)
2. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1()` reads \( n \) and \( m \) from the input.
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Loop Structure**:
   - The outer loop in `func_1()` iterates over \( x \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{n} \).
   - The inner loop iterates over \( y \) from 1 to a value such that \( (x + y) \cdot x \le n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot y \le m \).

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \) is checked using `math.gcd(x, y)`.
   - The count is incremented by the minimum of \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor \) and \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor \).

4. **Output**:
   - The result is printed correctly for each test case.

#### Detailed Evaluation:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Both `func_1()` and `func_2()` handle input correctly. `func_2()` reads the number of test cases and `func_1()` reads \( n \) and \( m \) for each test case.

2. **Loop Structure**:
   - The outer loop iterates over \( x \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{n} \). This is a valid approach because it reduces the number of pairs to check, but it might miss some pairs if \( a \) or \( b \) are not factors of \( x \) or \( y \).
   - The inner loop iterates over \( y \) from 1 to a value such that \( (x + y) \cdot x \le n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot y \le m \). This ensures that \( a \) and \( b \) are within the valid range.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \) is correctly checked.
   - The count is incremented by the minimum of \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor \) and \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor \). However, this approach is incorrect because it assumes that \( x \) and \( y \) are the factors of \( a \) and \( b \), which is not always the case. The correct approach should check all pairs \((a, b)\) directly.

4. **Output**:
   - The result is printed correctly for each test case, but the logic for counting valid pairs is flawed.

#### Correctness of the Logic:
- The program's logic for counting valid pairs is incorrect. It assumes that \( x \) and \( y \) are factors of \( a \) and \( b \), which is not always true. For example, if \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 4 \), the gcd is 2, but the program would not count this pair because it only considers pairs where \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \).

#### Example Verification:
- For the test case \( n = 10 \) and \( m = 8 \), the valid pairs are \((2, 2)\), \((3, 6)\), \((4, 4)\), \((6, 3)\), \((6, 6)\), and \((8, 8)\). The program should count these pairs, but it does not because it only considers pairs where \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. It misses valid pairs where \( \gcd(a, b) \neq 1 \).

Final: **False**
