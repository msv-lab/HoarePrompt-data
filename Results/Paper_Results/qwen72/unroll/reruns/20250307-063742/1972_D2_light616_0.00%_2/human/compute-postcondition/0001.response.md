The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input integer `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted as it is not used in the loop head to determine the loop's execution. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
