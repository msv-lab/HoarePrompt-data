### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates over all possible values of `x` such that \(x \cdot x \le n\).
   - For each `x`, it iterates over all possible values of `y` such that \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it adds the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\) to `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints `cnt`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` `t` times, each time processing a new test case.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The input handling in `func_2` is correct. It reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Pair Calculation**: In `func_1`, the logic for calculating the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) is flawed. The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is not correctly checked. The current implementation only checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and then adds the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\) to `cnt`. This does not ensure that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - **Output**: The output of `func_1` is the count of valid pairs, which is printed correctly for each test case.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\), the pairs \((2, 2)\), \((3, 6)\), \((4, 4)\), \((6, 3)\), \((6, 6)\), \((8, 8)\) are not correctly identified by the current implementation. The current implementation would only check pairs where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), which is not the correct condition.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the logic in `func_1` does not correctly implement the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).

Correctness: **False**
