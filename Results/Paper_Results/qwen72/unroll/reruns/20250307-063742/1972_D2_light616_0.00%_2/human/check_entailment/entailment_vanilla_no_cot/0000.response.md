Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Input Handling in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` should not directly read input from `input()`. Instead, it should accept `n` and `m` as parameters. This is because `func_1` is called multiple times within `func_2`, and each call should handle a different test case.

2. **Output Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` should return the count of valid pairs instead of printing it. The printing should be done in `func_2` after `func_1` has returned the result.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` is used to check if `x` and `y` are coprime. However, the calculation `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is not correct. The correct approach should be to check if `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b` for each pair `(a, b)`.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The current approach is not efficient for large values of `n` and `m` (up to \(2 \times 10^6\)). The nested loops will result in a time complexity of \(O(n \sqrt{n})\), which is too slow for the given constraints.

### Corrected Program:
To address these issues, we need to modify the program to correctly handle input and output, and to use a more efficient approach to count the valid pairs.

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
            if (b * gcd_ab) % (a + b) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        result = count_valid_pairs(n, m)
        print(result)

# Example usage
func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Function `count_valid_pairs`**:
   - This function takes `n` and `m` as parameters and counts the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.
   - It iterates over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges and checks if `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `count_valid_pairs` with the appropriate values of `n` and `m`.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

### Efficiency Consideration:
The corrected program has a time complexity of \(O(t \cdot n \cdot m)\), which is still not efficient for large values of `n` and `m`. However, it correctly implements the logic and can be further optimized if needed. For the given constraints, a more efficient approach would be required, such as using number theory properties to reduce the number of pairs to check.
