You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `x * x <= n`, `(x + y) * x <= n`, `(x + y) * y <= m`, and `gcd(x, y) == 1`.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy `x * x <= n`, `(x + y) * x <= n`, `(x + y) * y <= m`, and `gcd(x, y) == 1`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the user input, where `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`. It then calculates the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `x * x <= n`, `(x + y) * x <= n`, `(x + y) * y <= m`, and `gcd(x, y) == 1`. The function prints this count as the final output. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`, and `cnt` holds the calculated count of valid pairs.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, but the function assumes that `func_1` is defined and can handle the input and output as described in the problem.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: The loop has executed `func_1` `t` times, but since `func_1` does not return any value or modify any variables in the loop head or body, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, and then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. The function does not return any value, and it does not modify any variables or state outside of its scope. The primary purpose of `func_2` is to execute `func_1` a specified number of times based on user input.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
We are given two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \( 1 \le a \le n \) and \( 1 \le b \le m \)
2. \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is a multiple of \( a + b \)

### Program Analysis:

#### Function 1: `func_1()`
- **Input Handling**: The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \) from the input.
- **Loop Structure**:
  - The outer loop iterates over \( x \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{n} \).
  - The inner loop iterates over \( y \) from 1 to a value such that \( (x + y) \cdot x \le n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot y \le m \).
- **Condition Check**:
  - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \).
  - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count by the minimum of \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor \) and \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor \).

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases \( t \) from the input.
- **Test Case Loop**: For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to process the input and print the result.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1()` correctly reads \( n \) and \( m \) for each test case.
   - `func_2()` correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Loop Structure**:
   - The outer loop in `func_1()` iterates over \( x \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{n} \). This is a valid approach because \( x \) and \( y \) are factors of \( a \) and \( b \), and we only need to consider pairs up to \( \sqrt{n} \) to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The inner loop iterates over \( y \) from 1 to a value such that \( (x + y) \cdot x \le n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot y \le m \). This ensures that \( a \) and \( b \) are within the valid range.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \) is correctly checked using `math.gcd(x, y)`.
   - The count is incremented by the minimum of \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor \) and \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor \). This is correct because it ensures that both \( a \) and \( b \) are within the valid range and the condition \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is a multiple of \( a + b \) is satisfied.

4. **Output**:
   - The result is printed correctly for each test case.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \) and \( m = 1 \) correctly, as it prints 0.
- The program also handles larger values of \( n \) and \( m \) as shown in the example.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles multiple test cases and ensures that the pairs \((a, b)\) satisfy the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
