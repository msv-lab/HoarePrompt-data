The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, the problem statement mentions that `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. Since these parameters are not part of the function's input, they must be defined or used within the function body. The output of the function is not provided, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is not clear based on the provided information.**
