The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the user input, where `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`. It then calculates the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `x * x <= n`, `(x + y) * x <= n`, `(x + y) * y <= m`, and `gcd(x, y) == 1`. The function prints this count as the final output. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`, and `cnt` holds the calculated count of valid pairs.
