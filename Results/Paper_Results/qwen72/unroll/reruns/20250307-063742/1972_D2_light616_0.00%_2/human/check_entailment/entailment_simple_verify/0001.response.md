### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1()` reads \( n \) and \( m \) from the input for each test case.
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
   - This is consistent with the problem description and the annotated code.

2. **Loop Structure**:
   - The outer loop in `func_1()` iterates over \( x \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{n} \). This is a valid approach because it reduces the number of iterations by considering only pairs \((x, y)\) where \( x \le \sqrt{n} \).
   - The inner loop iterates over \( y \) from 1 to a value such that \( (x + y) \cdot x \le n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot y \le m \). This ensures that \( a \) and \( b \) are within the valid range.
   - The annotated code confirms that the loop conditions are correctly applied.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \) is correctly checked using `math.gcd(x, y)`.
   - The count is incremented by the minimum of \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor \) and \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor \). This is correct because it ensures that both \( a \) and \( b \) are within the valid range and the condition \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is a multiple of \( a + b \) is satisfied.
   - The annotated code confirms that the condition check and count increment are correctly implemented.

4. **Output**:
   - The result is printed correctly for each test case.
   - The annotated code confirms that the output is the sum of the minimum values for all valid pairs \((x, y)\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \) and \( m = 1 \) correctly, as it prints 0.
   - The program also handles larger values of \( n \) and \( m \) as shown in the example.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles multiple test cases and ensures that the pairs \((a, b)\) satisfy the given conditions.

Final: **True**
