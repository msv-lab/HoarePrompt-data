### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given Python program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided function summaries.

#### Function 1: `func_1()`
- **Input Handling**: The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \) from the input.
- **Loop Structure**:
  - The outer loop iterates over \( x \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{n} \). This is a valid approach because \( x \) and \( y \) are factors of \( a \) and \( b \), and we only need to consider pairs up to \( \sqrt{n} \) to avoid redundant calculations.
  - The inner loop iterates over \( y \) from 1 to a value such that \( (x + y) \cdot x \le n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot y \le m \). This ensures that \( a \) and \( b \) are within the valid range.
- **Condition Check**:
  - The condition \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \) is correctly checked using `math.gcd(x, y)`.
  - The count is incremented by the minimum of \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor \) and \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor \). This is intended to ensure that both \( a \) and \( b \) are within the valid range and the condition \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is a multiple of \( a + b \) is satisfied.

However, there is a critical issue in the logic of `func_1()`:
- The condition \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) being a multiple of \( a + b \) is not correctly checked by the current implementation. The current implementation only checks if \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \), which is not sufficient to ensure that \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is a multiple of \( a + b \).

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases \( t \) from the input.
- **Test Case Loop**: For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to process the input and print the result.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1()` correctly reads \( n \) and \( m \) for each test case.
   - `func_2()` correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Loop Structure**:
   - The outer loop in `func_1()` iterates over \( x \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{n} \). This is a valid approach.
   - The inner loop iterates over \( y \) from 1 to a value such that \( (x + y) \cdot x \le n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot y \le m \). This ensures that \( a \) and \( b \) are within the valid range.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \) is correctly checked using `math.gcd(x, y)`.
   - However, the count increment logic is incorrect. The current implementation increments the count by the minimum of \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor \) and \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor \), which does not ensure that \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is a multiple of \( a + b \).

4. **Output**:
   - The result is printed correctly for each test case, but the result itself may be incorrect due to the flawed condition check.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \) and \( m = 1 \) correctly, as it prints 0.
- For larger values of \( n \) and \( m \), the program may produce incorrect results due to the flawed condition check.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The condition \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) being a multiple of \( a + b \) is not properly checked, leading to potential incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
