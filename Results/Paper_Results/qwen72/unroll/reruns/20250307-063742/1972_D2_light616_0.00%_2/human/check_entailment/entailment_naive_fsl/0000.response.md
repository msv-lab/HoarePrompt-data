Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical issue in the way it calculates the number of valid pairs. Specifically, the condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` is used to check if the pair `(x, y)` is valid, but this condition alone is not sufficient to ensure that `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.

The correct condition should be:
- `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`

However, the program does not correctly implement this condition. Instead, it uses a different approach that does not guarantee the correctness of the solution.

For example, consider the input `n = 2` and `m = 3`. The valid pairs are `(1, 1)` and `(2, 3)`. The program, however, only counts `(1, 1)` and misses `(2, 3)` because it does not correctly handle the condition for all pairs.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
