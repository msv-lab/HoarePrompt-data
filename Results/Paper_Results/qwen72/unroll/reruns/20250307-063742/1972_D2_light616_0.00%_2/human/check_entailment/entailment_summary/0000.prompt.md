Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the user input, where `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`. It then calculates the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `x * x <= n`, `(x + y) * x <= n`, `(x + y) * y <= m`, and `gcd(x, y) == 1`. The function prints this count as the final output. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`, and `cnt` holds the calculated count of valid pairs.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, and then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. The function does not return any value, and it does not modify any variables or state outside of its scope. The primary purpose of `func_2` is to execute `func_1` a specified number of times based on user input.
