Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - It reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
   - It iterates over possible values of `x` from 1 to the square root of `n` (inclusive).
   - For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1.
   - It checks if the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are satisfied.
   - If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, it means `x` and `y` are coprime, and it counts the number of valid pairs by adding `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` to `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints the count of valid pairs.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It iterates over each test case and calls `func_1` for each one.

The logic in `func_1` is designed to find pairs `(a, b)` where `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`. The use of the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the conditions ensure that the pairs are counted correctly. The program also handles multiple test cases as required.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for valid inputs.
