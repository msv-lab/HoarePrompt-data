Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input, where `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`. It calculates the total count of pairs `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are coprime, `x * x <= n`, and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. After the calculation, it prints the count `cnt` and does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `cnt` is printed, representing the total number of valid coprime pairs. **
