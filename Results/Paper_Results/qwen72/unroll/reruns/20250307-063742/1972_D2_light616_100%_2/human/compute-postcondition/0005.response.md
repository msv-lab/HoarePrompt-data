To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
   - `cnt` is the total count of pairs `(x, y)` where:
     - `x` and `y` are coprime.
     - `x * x <= n`.
     - `(x + y) * x <= n`.
     - `(x + y) * y <= m`.

2. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `x` is determined by the condition that it is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`. This means `x` is the ceiling of the square root of `n`.
   - `cnt` is the count of pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy the given conditions. The conditions are:
     - `x` and `y` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1).
     - `x * x <= n` ensures that `x` is within a certain range.
     - `(x + y) * x <= n` ensures that the product of `x` and the sum of `x` and `y` is within the limit `n`.
     - `(x + y) * y <= m` ensures that the product of `y` and the sum of `x` and `y` is within the limit `m`.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The exact value of `cnt` depends on the specific values of `n` and `m`.
   - Without knowing the exact values of `n` and `m`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`.
   - However, based on the given conditions, `cnt` will be the count of valid pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy all the conditions.

Therefore, the output of the `print(cnt)` statement will be the count of such pairs.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the total count of pairs (x, y) that satisfy the given conditions: x and y are coprime, x * x <= n, (x + y) * x <= n, and (x + y) * y <= m)**
