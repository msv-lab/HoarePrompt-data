Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Description
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

### Program Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1()`
- **Input**: The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
- **Loop 1**: The outer loop iterates over \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
- **Loop 2**: The inner loop iterates over \(y\) starting from 1. It continues as long as \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
- **Condition**: Inside the inner loop, it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of \(n // ((x + y) \cdot x)\) and \(m // ((x + y) * y)\).

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Input**: The function reads the number of test cases \(t\).
- **Loop**: It iterates over each test case and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Reasoning
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case.
2. **GCD Calculation**: The program uses `math.gcd(x, y)` to calculate the greatest common divisor of \(x\) and \(y\), which is correct.
3. **Condition Check**: The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is checked by ensuring \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). This is because if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = b \cdot 1 = b\), and we need \(b\) to be a multiple of \(a + b\). This is a valid approach.
4. **Counting Valid Pairs**: The program increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of \(n // ((x + y) \cdot x)\) and \(m // ((x + y) * y)\). This is because for each pair \((x, y)\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), the pairs \((k \cdot (x + y) \cdot x, k \cdot (x + y) \cdot y)\) for \(k\) such that \(k \cdot (x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \(k \cdot (x + y) \cdot y \le m\) are valid pairs. The minimum of these two values ensures that both conditions are satisfied.
5. **Loop Bounds**: The outer loop runs up to \(\sqrt{n}\) and the inner loop runs up to the point where \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\). This is an efficient way to ensure that all valid pairs are considered without exceeding the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. It handles the input and output correctly and uses an efficient approach to count the valid pairs.

Correctness: **True**
