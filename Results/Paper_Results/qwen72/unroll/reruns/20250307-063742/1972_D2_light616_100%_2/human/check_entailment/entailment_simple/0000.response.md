### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` in `func_2` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to process the values of `n` and `m`.

2. **Pair Generation and Conditions:**
   - In `func_1`, the program generates pairs `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are positive integers.
   - It ensures that `x * x <= n` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
   - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` checks if `x` and `y` are coprime.
   - If the pairs satisfy these conditions, it increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all pairs, `func_1` prints the count `cnt` of valid pairs for the current test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` and `m` are both 1, correctly outputting 0.
   - It also handles larger values of `n` and `m` as shown in the example.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses a nested loop to generate pairs, but it stops when `x * x` exceeds `n`, which helps in reducing the number of iterations.
   - The use of `math.gcd` ensures that only coprime pairs are considered, which is necessary for the problem.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies pairs `(a, b)` where `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.
   - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that `x` and `y` are coprime, which is a key part of the problem.
   - The count `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`, which correctly accounts for the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that can be formed from the pair `(x, y)`.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions. The use of coprime pairs and the constraints on `x` and `y` are handled appropriately, ensuring the program produces the correct output for the given problem.
