You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a non-negative integer `t` from the user input, where 1 <= t <= 10^4, and then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. The value of `t` remains unchanged after the function execution. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Description
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

### Program Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1()`
- **Input**: The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
- **Loop 1**: The outer loop iterates over \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
- **Loop 2**: The inner loop iterates over \(y\) starting from 1. It continues as long as \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
- **Condition**: Inside the inner loop, it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of \(n // ((x + y) \cdot x)\) and \(m // ((x + y) * y)\).

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Input**: The function reads the number of test cases \(t\).
- **Loop**: It iterates over each test case and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Reasoning
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case.
2. **GCD Calculation**: The program uses `math.gcd(x, y)` to calculate the greatest common divisor of \(x\) and \(y\), which is correct.
3. **Condition Check**: The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is checked by ensuring \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). This is because if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = b \cdot 1 = b\), and we need \(b\) to be a multiple of \(a + b\). This is a valid approach.
4. **Counting Valid Pairs**: The program increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of \(n // ((x + y) \cdot x)\) and \(m // ((x + y) * y)\). This is because for each pair \((x, y)\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), the pairs \((k \cdot (x + y) \cdot x, k \cdot (x + y) \cdot y)\) for \(k\) such that \(k \cdot (x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \(k \cdot (x + y) \cdot y \le m\) are valid pairs. The minimum of these two values ensures that both conditions are satisfied.
5. **Loop Bounds**: The outer loop runs up to \(\sqrt{n}\) and the inner loop runs up to the point where \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\). This is an efficient way to ensure that all valid pairs are considered without exceeding the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. It handles the input and output correctly and uses an efficient approach to count the valid pairs.
