Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
1. `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`.
2. `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.

The provided functions are:
1. `func_1()`: This function calculates the number of valid pairs `(x, y)` for a single test case. It iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` and checks if the conditions are met. Specifically, it checks if `x` and `y` are coprime (`gcd(x, y) == 1`) and if `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If these conditions are met, it increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1()` for each test case.

Let's analyze the correctness of `func_1()`:
- The function correctly reads `n` and `m` from the input.
- It iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` to find pairs that satisfy the conditions.
- The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that `x` and `y` are coprime.
- The condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` ensures that the pairs `(a, b)` are within the bounds of `n` and `m`.
- The count `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`, which correctly counts the number of valid pairs for each coprime pair `(x, y)`.

However, there is a subtle issue with the implementation:
- The function `func_1()` is designed to handle a single test case, but it does not reset the count `cnt` to zero for each new test case. This means that the count from the previous test case will be carried over, leading to incorrect results for subsequent test cases.

Given this, the program as a whole is incorrect because `func_1()` should reset `cnt` to zero at the beginning of each test case.

Correctness: **False**
