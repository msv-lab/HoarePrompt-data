You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a non-negative integer `t` from the user input, where 1 <= t <= 10^4, and then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. The value of `t` remains unchanged after the function execution. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of valid pairs for a single test case, but it does not reset the `cnt` variable between different test cases when called multiple times within `func_2`. This can lead to incorrect results for subsequent test cases because the count from the previous test case will be carried over.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
1 1
2 3
```

The expected output is:
```
0
1
```

However, the program will output:
```
0
1
```
for the first test case, but the `cnt` variable will not be reset, leading to an incorrect count for the second test case. The `cnt` variable should be reset to 0 at the beginning of each call to `func_1` to ensure that each test case is handled independently.

To fix this, the `cnt` variable should be initialized inside `func_1` for each test case. Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:
```python
import math

def func_1(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    x = 1
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    return cnt

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(func_1(n, m))
```

With this correction, the program will correctly handle each test case independently.
