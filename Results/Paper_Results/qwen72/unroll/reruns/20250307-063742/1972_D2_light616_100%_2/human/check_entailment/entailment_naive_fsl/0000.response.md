Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of valid pairs for a single test case, but it does not reset the `cnt` variable between different test cases when called multiple times within `func_2`. This can lead to incorrect results for subsequent test cases because the count from the previous test case will be carried over.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
1 1
2 3
```

The expected output is:
```
0
1
```

However, the program will output:
```
0
1
```
for the first test case, but the `cnt` variable will not be reset, leading to an incorrect count for the second test case. The `cnt` variable should be reset to 0 at the beginning of each call to `func_1` to ensure that each test case is handled independently.

To fix this, the `cnt` variable should be initialized inside `func_1` for each test case. Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:
```python
import math

def func_1(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    x = 1
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    return cnt

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(func_1(n, m))
```

With this correction, the program will correctly handle each test case independently.
