The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might use or generate values for `n` and `m` internally, where `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
