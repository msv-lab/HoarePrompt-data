Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

Let's analyze the provided functions:

### Function 1: `func_1()`
- **Input**: Reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
- **Loop 1**: Iterates over `x` from 1 to the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
- **Loop 2**: For each `x`, iterates over `y` from 1 to the maximum value such that \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
- **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) (i.e., `x` and `y` are coprime).
- **Count Update**: If the condition is met, it updates the count `cnt` by adding the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
- **Output**: Prints the count `cnt`.

### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Input**: Reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
- **Loop**: Iterates `t` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.
- **Output**: No explicit output, but `func_1()` is called for each test case, which prints the count for each test case.

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: Both functions handle input correctly. `func_2()` reads the number of test cases `t`, and `func_1()` reads `n` and `m` for each test case.
2. **Condition Check**: The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is correctly checked by ensuring \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and then counting the valid pairs.
3. **Count Calculation**: The count is updated correctly by considering the range of valid pairs for each coprime pair \((x, y)\).

However, there is a subtle issue in the logic of `func_1()`:
- The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is not directly checked. Instead, the function assumes that if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then the pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a = (x + y) \cdot x\) and \(b = (x + y) \cdot y\) will satisfy the condition. This assumption is not always correct.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly implement the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\). The logic in `func_1()` is flawed because it only checks for coprime pairs and does not verify the actual condition for each pair.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
