The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, it is expected to operate under the constraint that a non-negative integer `t` is defined such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since the function does not take any parameters, the output must be determined by some internal logic or predefined conditions related to `t`. Without further details on the internal logic or the specific output based on `t`, the functionality can only be described in general terms.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and is designed to operate under the assumption that a non-negative integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) is defined. It returns a value based on the predefined conditions or internal logic related to `t`.**
