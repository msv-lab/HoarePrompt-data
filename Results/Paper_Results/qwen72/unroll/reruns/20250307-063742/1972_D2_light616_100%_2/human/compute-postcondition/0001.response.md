The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted as it is not used to control the loop. 

Given that `t` is an input integer with the constraint 1 <= t <= 10^4, this already ensures that `t` is greater than 0, so no further adjustment is needed for `t` to make the loop execute. However, for clarity, we can state that `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable**
