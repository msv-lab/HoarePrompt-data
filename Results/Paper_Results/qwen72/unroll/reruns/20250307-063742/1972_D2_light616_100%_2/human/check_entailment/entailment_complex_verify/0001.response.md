### Reasoning

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and the values of \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case. This is handled by `func_2()` and `func_1()` respectively.

2. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The program uses `math.gcd(x, y)` to calculate the greatest common divisor of \(x\) and \(y\), which is correct.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is checked by ensuring \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). This is because if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = b \cdot 1 = b\), and we need \(b\) to be a multiple of \(a + b\). However, this is not the correct interpretation of the problem. The correct condition is that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) should be a multiple of \(a + b\), not just \(b\).

4. **Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - The program increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of \(n // ((x + y) \cdot x)\) and \(m // ((x + y) \cdot y)\). This is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a = k \cdot (x + y) \cdot x\) and \(b = k \cdot (x + y) \cdot y\) for \(k\) such that \(k \cdot (x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \(k \cdot (x + y) \cdot y \le m\). However, this approach does not correctly account for the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\).

5. **Loop Bounds**:
   - The outer loop runs up to \(\sqrt{n}\) and the inner loop runs up to the point where \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\). This is an efficient way to ensure that all valid pairs are considered without exceeding the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\). However, the logic inside the loop is flawed.

### Correct Condition Analysis
The correct condition is that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) should be a multiple of \(a + b\). This means:
\[ b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0 \]

For \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), the pairs \((a, b)\) should be such that:
\[ b \cdot 1 \mod (a + b) = 0 \]
\[ b \mod (a + b) = 0 \]

This implies that \(b\) must be a multiple of \(a + b\), which is not possible unless \(b = a + b\), which is not a valid pair since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers.

### Correct Approach
The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\). This would be more computationally expensive but necessary to ensure correctness.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not correctly implement the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\). The program only checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and then counts pairs based on a flawed logic.
