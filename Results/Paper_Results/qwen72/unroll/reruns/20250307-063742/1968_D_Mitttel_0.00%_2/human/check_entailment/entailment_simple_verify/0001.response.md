### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a game where two players, Bodya and Sasha, start at specific positions in a permutation and move according to the rules. The score is incremented by the value at the current position in the array `a` on each turn.
   - The game lasts for `k` turns, and the player with the higher score at the end wins. If both players have the same score, it's a draw.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**
   - This function takes the length of the permutation `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha `PB` and `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It calculates the scores for both players using the `calculate_score` function and compares them to determine the winner.
   - The logic for comparing scores and returning the appropriate result is correct.

3. **Function 2: `calculate_score`**
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position `start_pos`.
   - It initializes the score to 0 and the current position to `start_pos`.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to keep track of positions and the step at which they were visited to detect cycles.
   - The function iterates up to `k` steps, adding the score from the current position and moving to the next position based on the permutation `p`.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by first determining the cycle length and cycle score, then adding the full cycles and the remainder steps to the total score.
   - The function correctly handles both the case where a cycle is detected and where it is not.

4. **Function 3: `func_2`**
   - This function reads input from `stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It initializes the index and reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` and calls `func_1` to determine the result.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end.
   - The input reading and processing logic is correct and follows the given input format.

### Annotations and State Analysis:

- **Function 1: `func_1`**
  - The state before the function call is correctly described: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `PB` and `PS` are integers such that \(1 \le PB, PS \le n\), `p` is a list representing a permutation, and `a` is a list of integers.
  - The function calls `calculate_score` for both `PB` and `PS` and compares the results.
  - The return statements are correct and follow the problem's requirements.

- **Function 2: `calculate_score`**
  - The state before the function call is correctly described: `start_pos` is an integer such that \(1 \le start_pos \le n\).
  - The function correctly initializes `score`, `current_pos`, `steps`, `visited`, and `cycle_start`.
  - The loop iterates up to `k` steps, adding the score and moving to the next position based on the permutation `p`.
  - If a cycle is detected, the function correctly calculates the cycle length and cycle score, then updates the score for the remaining steps.
  - The final state after the function call is correctly described: `score` is the total score after `k` steps, considering cycles if detected.

- **Function 3: `func_2`**
  - The state before the function call is correctly described: the function reads input from `stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
  - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
  - It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
  - The results are printed at the end, and the final state is correctly described.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly implements the logic for the game described in the problem.
- It handles the input and output as specified.
- The cycle detection and score calculation are implemented correctly to handle the constraints and edge cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.
