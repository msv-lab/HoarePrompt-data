Output State: **The program returns the final value of `score`. If a cycle is detected (`cycle_start` is not -1), `score` is updated to `score + full_cycles * cycle_score + sum of the values from `a` that were added during the `remainder_steps` iterations`. If no cycle is detected (`cycle_start` is -1), `score` retains its value from the loop.**
