You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

If a cycle is detected (`cycle_start` is not -1), `score` is updated to `score + full_cycles * cycle_score + sum of the values from `a` that were added during the `remainder_steps` iterations`. If no cycle is detected (`cycle_start` is -1), `score` retains its value from the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `calculate_score` accepts an integer `start_pos` and returns an integer `score`. It calculates the score by summing up elements from the array `a` based on a sequence of positions determined by the permutation `p`, starting from `start_pos`. If a cycle is detected in the permutation, the function adjusts the score to account for the full cycles and any remaining steps. The final state of the program is that `score` reflects the total sum of the values from `a` that were added during the specified number of steps `k`, considering any cycles in the permutation.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters, but it reads input from stdin.

For each test case, the next integers n, k, PB, PS (1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) represent the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively. The following n integers represent the permutation p, and the next n integers represent the array a, where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case involves a permutation and an array, along with game parameters. The function determines whether Bodya can win the game for each test case and prints the results in the order of the test cases. After the function concludes, `index` is 1 + 4 * t + 2 * n * t, `t` remains the same as the initial value, and `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of the function `func_1` for each iteration.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the game's rules, including the detection of cycles in the permutation and the calculation of scores based on the number of turns and the cycle lengths. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha, and the `calculate_score` function correctly handles the cycle detection and score calculation for each player. The `func_2` function reads the input and processes multiple test cases as required. The program follows the problem description for every potential case, and I cannot think of an example where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
