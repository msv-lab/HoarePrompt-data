The value of `score` is updated by adding the product of `full_cycles` and `cycle_score` to its current value. The values of `cycle_score`, `cycle_pos`, `steps`, `visited`, `cycle_start`, `cycle_length`, `remaining_steps`, and `full_cycles` remain unchanged. The value of `remainder_steps` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`score` is updated to `score + full_cycles * cycle_score`, `cycle_score` is the sum of the values from `a` that were added during the loop, `cycle_pos` is the position where the cycle ends (which is the same as the starting position of the cycle, `current_pos`), `steps`, `score`, `visited`, `cycle_start`, `cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`.**
