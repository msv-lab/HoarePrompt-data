Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end.

2. **Score Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions and the given permutation and array.
   - It uses the `calculate_score` function to compute the score for each player.
   - The function correctly compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

3. **Cycle Detection and Score Adjustment in `calculate_score`**:
   - The function `calculate_score` correctly handles the movement of the player based on the permutation.
   - It detects cycles in the permutation and adjusts the score to account for full cycles and the remaining steps.
   - The cycle detection and score adjustment logic is sound and follows the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The functions handle edge cases such as when the permutation is a single element or when the game duration `k` is very large.
   - The cycle detection ensures that the score calculation is efficient even for large `k` values.

5. **Output**:
   - The output for each test case is correctly formatted and matches the problem requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles input parsing, score calculation, cycle detection, and output formatting as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
