### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Input State**: The function receives `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` as parameters. These parameters are valid according to the problem description.
   - **Behavior**:
     - The function calls `calculate_score` twice, once for Bodya's starting position (`PB`) and once for Sasha's starting position (`PS`).
     - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result: "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if the scores are equal.
   - **Output State**: The function returns one of the three strings: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly follows the logic of comparing the scores and determining the winner. The correctness of this function depends on the correctness of `calculate_score`.

2. **Function 2 (`calculate_score`)**:
   - **Input State**: The function receives `start_pos` as a parameter, which is a valid starting position (1 ≤ `start_pos` ≤ `n`).
   - **Behavior**:
     - **Initial Setup**: Initializes `score`, `current_pos`, `steps`, `visited`, and `cycle_start`.
     - **Main Loop**: The loop runs until `steps` reaches `k` or a cycle is detected.
       - **Cycle Detection**: If a cycle is detected, the loop breaks and the cycle is processed.
       - **Score Calculation**: Adds the value of `a[current_pos - 1]` to `score` and updates `current_pos` to `p[current_pos - 1]`.
     - **Cycle Handling**:
       - **Cycle Length and Score**: Calculates the length and score of the cycle.
       - **Remaining Steps**: Calculates the number of full cycles and the remainder steps.
       - **Update Score**: Adds the score for full cycles and the score for the remaining steps.
   - **Output State**: Returns the final score.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly handles the game's rules, including cycle detection and score calculation. It ensures that the score is updated correctly for both the initial non-cyclic part and the cyclic part of the game.

3. **Function 3 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Input State**: Reads input from stdin, which is expected to be formatted as described in the problem statement.
   - **Behavior**:
     - **Reading Input**: Reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
     - **Processing Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`, and calls `func_1` to determine the winner.
     - **Output**: Appends the result of each test case to the `results` list and prints the results.
   - **Output State**: Prints the results for all test cases.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly reads and processes the input, and it calls `func_1` for each test case. The results are printed in the correct format.

### Final Evaluation:
- **Reasoning**:
  - The program correctly implements the logic for the "Permutation game" as described in the problem statement.
  - It handles the game rules, including cycle detection and score calculation, for both players.
  - The input and output formats are correctly managed, and the program processes multiple test cases as required.
  - The original assessment is accurate, and I cannot think of any edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to produce the correct result.

- **Final**: **True**
