The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the `remainder_steps`. For the loop to execute, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`score` is updated to `score + full_cycles * cycle_score`, `cycle_score` is the sum of the values from `a` that were added during the loop, `cycle_pos` is the position where the cycle ends (which is the same as the starting position of the cycle, `current_pos`), `steps`, `score`, `visited`, `cycle_start`, `cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0**
