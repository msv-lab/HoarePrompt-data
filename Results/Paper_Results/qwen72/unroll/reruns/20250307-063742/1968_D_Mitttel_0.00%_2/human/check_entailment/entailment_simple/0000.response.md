### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_2` reads the input and processes it correctly. It splits the input into a list of integers and iterates over the test cases, extracting the necessary values for each test case.
   - The indices are correctly incremented to move through the input data.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - `calculate_score` is designed to compute the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It correctly handles the case where a cycle is detected in the permutation. If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the full cycles and the remaining steps outside the cycle.
   - The function correctly updates the score and returns it.

3. **Game Outcome Determination:**
   - `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha, compares their scores, and returns the appropriate result.
   - The logic for comparing scores and determining the winner is straightforward and correct.

4. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The cycle detection in `calculate_score` is implemented using a dictionary to track visited positions and the step at which they were visited.
   - If a cycle is detected, the function correctly calculates the cycle length and the score for the cycle.
   - The remaining steps are then processed to add the appropriate score.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the game lasts only one turn (`k = 1`).
   - It also handles the case where the starting positions are the same for both players.
   - The program correctly processes large inputs and long game durations (`k` up to \(10^9\)).

6. **Output:**
   - The final output is correctly formatted and matches the problem description.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all the specified constraints and edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
