Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function initializes the scores for Bodya and Sasha by calling `calculate_score` with their respective starting positions.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It keeps track of the current position, the score, and the number of steps taken.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles in the permutation.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by first determining the score for one full cycle and then using this to compute the score for all full cycles and the remaining steps.
   - If no cycle is detected, it simply sums the scores for each step until the game ends.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them at the end.

The program handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, such as detecting cycles and computing scores for large values of `k`. The logic for determining the winner based on the scores is also correct. Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem.
