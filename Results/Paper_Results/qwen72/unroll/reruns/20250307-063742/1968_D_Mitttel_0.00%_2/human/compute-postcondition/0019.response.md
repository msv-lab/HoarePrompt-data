Postcondition: ***`steps` will be equal to `k` or the loop will break if a cycle is detected. `score` will be the sum of the values from `a` that were added during the loop. If a cycle is detected (`cycle_start` is not -1), `score` is updated to `score + full_cycles * cycle_score + sum of the values from `a` that were added during the `remainder_steps` iterations`, `current_pos` is the position after `remainder_steps` iterations, `steps` is `steps + remainder_steps`, and `remaining_steps` is `0`. The values of `visited`, `cycle_start`, and `cycle_length` remain unchanged. If no cycle is detected (`cycle_start` is -1), `score`, `current_pos`, `steps`, `visited`, `cycle_start`, and `cycle_length` retain their values from the loop.***
