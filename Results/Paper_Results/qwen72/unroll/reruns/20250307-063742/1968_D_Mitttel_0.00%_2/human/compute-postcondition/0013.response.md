Output State: **`cycle_score` will be the sum of the values from `a` that were added during the loop, `cycle_pos` will be the position where the cycle ends (which is the same as the starting position of the cycle, `current_pos`), `steps`, `score`, `visited`, and `cycle_start` will remain unchanged, `cycle_length` will remain the same, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`.** 

The value of `remaining_steps` is calculated as the difference between `k` and `steps`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
