The function `calculate_score` accepts a parameter `start_pos`. `start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= start_pos <= n, where n is the length of the permutation p and the array a. The function returns the final value of `score`. If a cycle is detected (`cycle_start` is not -1), `score` is updated to `score + full_cycles * cycle_score + sum of the values from `a` that were added during the `remainder_steps` iterations`. If no cycle is detected (`cycle_start` is -1), `score` retains its value from the loop.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `start_pos` and returns the final value of `score`. If a cycle is detected in the permutation, the score is updated to include the full cycle score multiplied by the number of full cycles, plus the sum of the values from `a` added during the remaining steps. If no cycle is detected, the score remains unchanged.**
