### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a game played on a permutation and an array. Each player starts at a specific position in the permutation and can either stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation. The score is incremented by the value at the current position in the array `a` on each turn.
   - The game lasts for `k` turns, and the player with the higher score at the end wins. If both players have the same score, it's a draw.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**
   - This function takes the length of the permutation `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha `PB` and `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It calculates the scores for both players using the `calculate_score` function and compares them to determine the winner.
   - The logic for comparing scores and returning the appropriate result is correct.

3. **Function 2: `calculate_score`**
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position `start_pos`.
   - It initializes the score to 0 and the current position to `start_pos`.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to keep track of positions and the step at which they were visited to detect cycles.
   - The function iterates up to `k` steps, adding the score from the current position and moving to the next position based on the permutation `p`.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by first determining the cycle length and cycle score, then adding the full cycles and the remainder steps to the total score.
   - The function correctly handles both the case where a cycle is detected and where it is not.

4. **Function 3: `func_2`**
   - This function reads input from `stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It initializes the index and reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` and calls `func_1` to determine the result.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end.
   - The input reading and processing logic is correct and follows the given input format.

### Annotations and State Analysis:

- **Function 1:**
  - **Initial State:** `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are all valid and within the specified constraints.
  - **After `calculate_score(PB)` and `calculate_score(PS)` calls:** `bodya_score` and `sasha_score` are correctly calculated based on the starting positions and the game rules.
  - **Comparison and Return:** The comparison logic is correct, and the function returns the appropriate result based on the scores.

- **Function 2:**
  - **Initial State:** `start_pos` is a valid integer within the range [1, n].
  - **Loop to Calculate Score:**
    - **Cycle Detection:** The function correctly detects cycles using the `visited` dictionary.
    - **Score Calculation:**
      - If no cycle is detected, the score is calculated directly by summing the values from `a` for the first `k` steps.
      - If a cycle is detected, the function calculates the cycle length and cycle score, then adjusts the score for full cycles and any remaining steps.
  - **Final State:** The function returns the correct score for the given starting position.

- **Function 3:**
  - **Initial State:** The function reads input from `stdin` and initializes `t` to the number of test cases.
  - **Processing Test Cases:**
    - For each test case, it reads the necessary inputs and calls `func_1` to determine the result.
    - The results are stored in a list `results`.
  - **Final State:** The function prints the results for all test cases in the correct order.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly implements the logic for the game described in the problem.
- It handles the input and output as specified.
- The cycle detection and score calculation are implemented correctly to handle the constraints and edge cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.
