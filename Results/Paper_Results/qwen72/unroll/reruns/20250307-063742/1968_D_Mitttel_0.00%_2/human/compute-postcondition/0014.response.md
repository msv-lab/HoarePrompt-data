Output State: **`cycle_score` will be the sum of the values from `a` that were added during the loop, `cycle_pos` will be the position where the cycle ends (which is the same as the starting position of the cycle, `current_pos`), `steps`, `score`, `visited`, and `cycle_start` will remain unchanged, `cycle_length` will remain the same, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`.**

Explanation:
- `full_cycles` is calculated as the integer division of `remaining_steps` by `cycle_length`.
- All other variables (`cycle_score`, `cycle_pos`, `steps`, `score`, `visited`, `cycle_start`, `cycle_length`, `remaining_steps`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
