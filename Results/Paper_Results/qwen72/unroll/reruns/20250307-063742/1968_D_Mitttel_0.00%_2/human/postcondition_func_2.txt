The function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case involves a permutation and an array, along with game parameters. The function determines whether Bodya can win the game for each test case and prints the results in the order of the test cases. After the function concludes, `index` is 1 + 4 * t + 2 * n * t, `t` remains the same as the initial value, and `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of the function `func_1` for each iteration.
