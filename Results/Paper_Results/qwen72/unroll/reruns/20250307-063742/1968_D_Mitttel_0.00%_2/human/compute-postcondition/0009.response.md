Output State: **`index` remains 1 + 4 * t + 2 * n * t, `t` remains the same as the initial value, and `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of the function `func_1` for each iteration.**

Explanation: The loop only iterates over the `results` list and prints each element. It does not modify the values of `index`, `t`, or `results`. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
