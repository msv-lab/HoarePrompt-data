To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`.

1. **`results`**: This is the list that the loop iterates over. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element.
2. **`result`**: This is the variable that will hold each element of `results` during each iteration of the loop. It does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts, as it will be assigned values from `results` during the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `index` is 1 + 4 * t + 2 * n * t
- `t` is the same as the initial value
- `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of the function `func_1` for each iteration

For the loop to execute, `results` must have at least one element. Since `results` contains `t` elements, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`index` is 1 + 4 * t + 2 * n * t, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of the function `func_1` for each iteration, `result` is the first element in the list `results`**
