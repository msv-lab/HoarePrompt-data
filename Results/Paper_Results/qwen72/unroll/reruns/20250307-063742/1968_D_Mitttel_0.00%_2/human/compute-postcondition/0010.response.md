The function `func_2` does not take any parameters but reads input from stdin. The input is expected to be formatted such that the first integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the next integers `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS` (1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) represent the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively. The following `n` integers represent the permutation `p`, and the next `n` integers represent the array `a`, where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates whether Bodya can win the game or not.

Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and returns a list of results indicating whether Bodya can win the game for each test case.**
