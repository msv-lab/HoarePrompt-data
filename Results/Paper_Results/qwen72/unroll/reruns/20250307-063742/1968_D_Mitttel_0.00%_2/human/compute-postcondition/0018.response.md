Output State: **`score` is updated to `score + full_cycles * cycle_score + sum of the values from `a` that were added during the `remainder_steps` iterations, `current_pos` is the position after `remainder_steps` iterations, `steps` is `steps + remainder_steps`, `remaining_steps` is `0`, `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`. The values of `visited`, `cycle_start`, and `cycle_length` remain unchanged.**
