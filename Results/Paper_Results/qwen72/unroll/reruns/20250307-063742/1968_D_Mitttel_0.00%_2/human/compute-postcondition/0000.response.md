Output State: **The function now has access to a method `input` that reads from stdin. The initial state remains unchanged as the code snippet only assigns a function to the variable `input` and does not execute any input reading or variable assignment yet.**

The function does not take any parameters, but it reads input from stdin. The input is expected to be formatted such that the first integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the next integers n, k, PB, PS (1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) represent the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively. The following n integers represent the permutation p, and the next n integers represent the array a, where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The `input` function is now set to read from stdin, but no actual input has been read yet.
