Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the game's rules, including the detection of cycles in the permutation and the calculation of scores based on the number of turns and the cycle lengths. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha, and the `calculate_score` function correctly handles the cycle detection and score calculation for each player. The `func_2` function reads the input and processes multiple test cases as required. The program follows the problem description for every potential case, and I cannot think of an example where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
