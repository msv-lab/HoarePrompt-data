Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` and calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions `PB` and `PS`.
   - It uses the `calculate_score` function to compute the scores for each player.
   - The function compares the scores and returns the appropriate result: 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw'.
   - The function does not modify any of its input parameters, which is correct as it should only compute and return the result.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function takes a starting position `start_pos` and calculates the score for a player.
   - It initializes the score to 0 and the current position to the starting position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to track visited positions and detect cycles.
   - The function iterates up to `k` steps, adding the value from array `a` at the current position to the score and moving to the next position based on the permutation `p`.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the cycle length and cycle score, then adjusts the score for the remaining steps by adding the full cycle scores and the scores for the remaining steps after the last full cycle.
   - The function correctly handles the cycle detection and score adjustment, ensuring that the score is computed accurately for the given number of steps `k`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results in the order of the test cases.
   - The function correctly manages the input and output, ensuring that the results are printed as required.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" and handle the input and output as specified. The cycle detection and score calculation in `calculate_score` are crucial for handling large values of `k` efficiently, and the main function `func_2` processes the test cases correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
