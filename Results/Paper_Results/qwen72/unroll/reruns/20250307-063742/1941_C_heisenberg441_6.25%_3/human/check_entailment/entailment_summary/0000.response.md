Reasoning:  
The provided Python program aims to solve the problem of making a string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters to eliminate the substrings "map" and "pie". The function `func_1` performs the following steps:

1. **Special Case Handling**: If the string `s` is exactly "mapie", the function returns 1. This is a specific case that is not generally necessary for the problem, as the general logic should handle this case correctly. However, it does not affect the correctness of the solution for other cases.
2. **Removing Substrings**: The function uses a while loop to find and remove all occurrences of the substring "map" from `s`. Each time "map" is found, it is removed by slicing the string, and the counter `ans` is incremented.
3. **Removing Substrings (Continued)**: Similarly, the function uses another while loop to find and remove all occurrences of the substring "pie" from `s`. Each time "pie" is found, it is removed by slicing the string, and the counter `ans` is incremented.
4. **Returning the Result**: The function returns the total count of characters removed, which is stored in `ans`.

The logic of the program is correct in that it iteratively removes all occurrences of "map" and "pie" and counts the number of characters removed. However, there is a subtle issue in the removal process: the program only removes the first two characters of the substrings "map" and "pie" each time they are found, which means it is not removing the entire substring but only part of it. This can lead to incorrect results if the substrings overlap or if the removal process affects subsequent substrings.

For example, consider the string "mappie". The program will:
- First remove "map" to get "pie".
- Then remove "pie" to get an empty string.
- The total count of characters removed is 4, which is incorrect because the correct minimum number of characters to remove is 3 (removing "map" and "pie" entirely).

To fix this, the program should remove the entire substring "map" and "pie" each time they are found, not just the first two characters. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 3:]
        ans += 3
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 3:]
        ans += 3
    return ans
```

However, the original program does not handle the substrings correctly, and thus it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
