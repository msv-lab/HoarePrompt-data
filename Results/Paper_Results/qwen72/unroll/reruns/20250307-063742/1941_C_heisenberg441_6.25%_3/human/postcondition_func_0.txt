The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns an integer. If the string `s` is exactly 'mapie', the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function removes all occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' from `s` and returns the total number of times these substrings were found and removed. After the function concludes, the string `s` will have all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' removed, and the integer returned represents the count of these removals.
