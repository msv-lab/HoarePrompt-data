Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
- The goal is to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.
- The program should handle multiple test cases, each with a different string.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - The function `func_1(s)` is responsible for determining the minimum number of deletions required to make the string `s` beautiful.
   - The function first checks if the string is exactly "mapie" and returns 1 if true. This is a special case, but it doesn't cover all possible cases where the string might contain "pie" or "map".
   - The function then uses a while loop to find and remove occurrences of the substring "map" by slicing the string and incrementing the deletion count `ans`.
   - Similarly, it uses another while loop to find and remove occurrences of the substring "pie" by slicing the string and incrementing the deletion count `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the total number of deletions `ans`.

### Issues:
1. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The special case `if s == 'mapie': return 1` is not necessary and does not cover all possible cases. It only handles one specific string and can be misleading.

2. **Substring Removal:**
   - The program correctly identifies and removes occurrences of "map" and "pie" by slicing the string and incrementing the deletion count.
   - However, the slicing logic is incorrect. When removing "map", it should remove 3 characters, not 2. Similarly, when removing "pie", it should also remove 3 characters, not 2.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses a while loop to repeatedly find and remove substrings, which is inefficient for large strings. However, for the given constraints (sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^6\)), this approach might still be acceptable.

### Corrected Function:
To correct the program, we need to ensure that the correct number of characters are removed when "map" or "pie" is found. Here is the corrected function:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 3:]
        ans += 3
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 3:]
        ans += 3
    return ans
```

### Explanation:
- **Correct Number of Characters Removed:**
  - When "map" is found, the program now removes 3 characters.
  - When "pie" is found, the program now removes 3 characters.
- **No Special Case:**
  - The special case `if s == 'mapie': return 1` is removed as it is not necessary and can be handled by the main logic.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not remove the correct number of characters when "map" or "pie" is found. The corrected function ensures that the correct number of characters are removed, making the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
