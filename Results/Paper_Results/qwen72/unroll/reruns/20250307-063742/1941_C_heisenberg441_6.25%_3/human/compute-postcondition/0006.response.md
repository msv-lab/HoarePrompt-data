To ensure the loop can execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `s.find('pie') != -1`. This condition checks if the substring 'pie' is present in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one occurrence of 'pie'.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `s` is a string with all occurrences of 'map' removed.
- `ans` is the number of times 'map' was found and removed from `s`.

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `s`. To ensure the loop executes, `s` must contain at least one 'pie'. Since the state does not provide any information about the initial content of `s` other than the removal of 'map', we need to ensure that `s` contains 'pie' after the removal of 'map'.

State: **`s` is a string with all occurrences of 'map' removed and must contain at least one 'pie', `ans` is the number of times 'map' was found and removed from `s`**
