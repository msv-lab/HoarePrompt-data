You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Output

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    if s == 'mapie':
        return 1
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns an integer. If the string `s` is exactly 'mapie', the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function removes all occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' from `s` and returns the total number of times these substrings were found and removed. After the function concludes, the string `s` will have all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' removed, and the integer returned represents the count of these removals.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
- The goal is to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.
- The program should handle multiple test cases, each with a different string.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - The function `func_1(s)` is responsible for determining the minimum number of deletions required to make the string `s` beautiful.
   - The function first checks if the string is exactly "mapie" and returns 1 if true. This is a special case, but it doesn't cover all possible cases where the string might contain "pie" or "map".
   - The function then uses a while loop to find and remove occurrences of the substring "map" by slicing the string and incrementing the deletion count `ans`.
   - Similarly, it uses another while loop to find and remove occurrences of the substring "pie" by slicing the string and incrementing the deletion count `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the total number of deletions `ans`.

### Issues:
1. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The special case `if s == 'mapie': return 1` is not necessary and does not cover all possible cases. It only handles one specific string and can be misleading.

2. **Substring Removal:**
   - The program correctly identifies and removes occurrences of "map" and "pie" by slicing the string and incrementing the deletion count.
   - However, the slicing logic is incorrect. When removing "map", it should remove 3 characters, not 2. Similarly, when removing "pie", it should also remove 3 characters, not 2.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses a while loop to repeatedly find and remove substrings, which is inefficient for large strings. However, for the given constraints (sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^6\)), this approach might still be acceptable.

### Corrected Function:
To correct the program, we need to ensure that the correct number of characters are removed when "map" or "pie" is found. Here is the corrected function:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 3:]
        ans += 3
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 3:]
        ans += 3
    return ans
```

### Explanation:
- **Correct Number of Characters Removed:**
  - When "map" is found, the program now removes 3 characters.
  - When "pie" is found, the program now removes 3 characters.
- **No Special Case:**
  - The special case `if s == 'mapie': return 1` is removed as it is not necessary and can be handled by the main logic.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not remove the correct number of characters when "map" or "pie" is found. The corrected function ensures that the correct number of characters are removed, making the string beautiful.
