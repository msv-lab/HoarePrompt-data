Output State: **`s` is a string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, and `ans` is the number of times 'map' was found and removed from `s`.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'map' is found in the string `s`. Each time the substring 'map' is found, it is removed from `s` by slicing the string up to the index of 'map' and then from the index after 'p' in 'map' to the end of the string. The variable `ans` is incremented each time 'map' is removed. After all iterations, `s` will no longer contain the substring 'map', and `ans` will hold the total count of how many times 'map' was removed.
