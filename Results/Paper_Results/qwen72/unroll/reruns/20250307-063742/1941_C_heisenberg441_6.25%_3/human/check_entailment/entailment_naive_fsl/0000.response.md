Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` only removes the first two characters of the substrings "map" and "pie" when they are found, which can lead to incorrect results in some cases. For example, consider the string "mappie". The program will first remove "map" to get "pie", and then remove "pi" from "pie" to get "e", resulting in an incorrect answer of 2 instead of the correct answer of 1.

Here is a test case that demonstrates the issue:
Input:
```
1
7
mappie
```
Expected Output:
```
1
```
Actual Output:
```
2
