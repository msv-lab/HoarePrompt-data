Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` indeed has a flaw in its logic for removing substrings "map" and "pie". Specifically, the function removes only the first two characters of these substrings, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, in the string "mappie", the function will first remove "map" to get "pie", and then it will remove "pi" from "pie" to get "e", resulting in an incorrect answer of 2 instead of the correct answer of 1.

The function summary provided does not capture this specific behavior accurately. It states that the function removes all occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' and returns the total number of times these substrings were found and removed. However, the implementation only removes the first two characters, which can leave a trailing character that might still form part of another "map" or "pie" substring in subsequent iterations.

To correct this, the function should remove the entire substring "map" or "pie" when found, not just the first two characters. This would ensure that the minimum number of deletions is correctly calculated.

Here is the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 3:]
        ans += 3
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 3:]
        ans += 3
    return ans
```

However, the original function as provided does not correctly handle the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

Final: **False**
