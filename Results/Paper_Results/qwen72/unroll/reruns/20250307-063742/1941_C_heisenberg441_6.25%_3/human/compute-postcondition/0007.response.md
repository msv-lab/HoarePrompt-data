Output State: **`s` is a string with all occurrences of 'pie' removed, and `ans` is the number of times 'pie' was found and removed from `s`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'pie' is found in the string `s`.
- Each iteration of the loop removes the first occurrence of 'pie' from `s` by slicing the string before and after the 'pie' substring.
- The variable `ans` is incremented each time an occurrence of 'pie' is removed.
- After the loop finishes, `s` will no longer contain any 'pie' substrings, and `ans` will hold the total number of times 'pie' was found and removed from the initial string `s`.
