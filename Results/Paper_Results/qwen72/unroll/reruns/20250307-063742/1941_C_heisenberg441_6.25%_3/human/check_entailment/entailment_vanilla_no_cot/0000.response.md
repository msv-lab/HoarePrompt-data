Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases where the string needs to be made beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks for the exact substring "map" and "pie" and removes them by deleting the first two characters of the substring. However, this approach can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

For example, consider the string "mmapnapie":
- The first while loop will find "map" at index 1 and remove "ma" (leaving "mpnapie").
- The second while loop will find "pie" at index 4 and remove "pi" (leaving "mpnape").
- The final string "mpnape" still contains "map", but the program will not detect it and will output 2, which is incorrect.

The correct approach should be to remove the minimum number of characters to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring in the resulting string. The provided program does not handle overlapping occurrences or the optimal removal of characters correctly.

To fix this, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using regular expressions or a more detailed character removal strategy that considers all possible overlaps and ensures the minimum number of deletions.
