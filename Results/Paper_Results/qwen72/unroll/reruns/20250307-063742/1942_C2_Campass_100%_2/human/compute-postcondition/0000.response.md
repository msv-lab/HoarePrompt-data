Output State: **The function `R` is defined as a lambda function that maps the input split by spaces to integers. The initial state conditions for `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of `x` distinct integers remain unchanged.**

The function `R` is now defined and can be used to read and convert input values to integers. The initial constraints and conditions for the variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of `x` distinct integers are still valid and have not been modified by the code.
