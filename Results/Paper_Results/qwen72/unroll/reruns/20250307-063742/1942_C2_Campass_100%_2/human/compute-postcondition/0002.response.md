The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is truthy (i.e., non-zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is now an integer value input by the user. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be a non-zero integer.

State: **The function `R` is defined as a lambda function that maps the input split by spaces to integers. `t` is now a non-zero integer value input by the user, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of `x` distinct integers remain unchanged.**
