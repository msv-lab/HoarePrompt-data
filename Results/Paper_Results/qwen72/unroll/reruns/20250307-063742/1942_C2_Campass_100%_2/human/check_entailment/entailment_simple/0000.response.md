### Reasoning:

1. **Function Signature and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - Inside the loop, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` for each test case, and then reads a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
   - The function correctly sorts the list of vertices and appends a value to it to handle the circular nature of the polygon.

2. **Calculating the Gaps:**
   - The function calculates the gaps between consecutive vertices in the sorted list, including the gap between the last and the first vertex (due to the circular nature of the polygon).
   - These gaps are stored in the list `val`.

3. **Sorting the Gaps:**
   - The gaps are sorted based on a custom key: first by the parity of the gap (even gaps come before odd gaps), and then by the size of the gap.
   - This sorting ensures that even gaps are considered first, which is important for maximizing the number of triangles.

4. **Maximizing the Number of Triangles:**
   - The function iterates over the sorted gaps and tries to use the available vertices `y` to fill in the gaps.
   - For each gap, it calculates how many vertices can be added to form triangles and updates the total number of vertices added (`sx`).
   - If the available vertices `y` are insufficient to fill a gap, it adds as many vertices as possible and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Calculating the Final Result:**
   - The final result `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2`, which represents the total number of vertices used minus 2 (since a triangle requires 3 vertices).
   - This result is printed for each test case.

### Correctness:

- **Input Handling:** The function correctly reads the input and handles multiple test cases.
- **Gap Calculation:** The gaps are calculated correctly, and the circular nature of the polygon is accounted for.
- **Gap Sorting:** The gaps are sorted correctly to prioritize even gaps, which is a valid strategy for maximizing the number of triangles.
- **Vertex Usage:** The function correctly uses the available vertices to fill in the gaps and maximizes the number of triangles.
- **Result Calculation:** The final result is calculated correctly based on the problem's constraints and requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Correctness: **True**
