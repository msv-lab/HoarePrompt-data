### Reasoning:

1. **Function Signature and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
   - The function signature is correct in the sense that it does not need to take arguments directly, as it reads input from `stdin`.

2. **Sorting and Appending:**
   - The list `l` of chosen vertices is sorted, and an additional vertex `n + l[0]` is appended to the list. This is done to handle the circular nature of the polygon by treating the last vertex as if it were connected to the first vertex in a linear manner.

3. **Calculating Gaps:**
   - The function calculates the gaps between consecutive vertices in the sorted list `l` and stores these gaps in the list `val`. This is done to determine the number of vertices that can be added between each pair of Bessie's chosen vertices.

4. **Sorting Gaps:**
   - The gaps in `val` are sorted based on a custom key: first by whether the gap is odd or even (1 - x & 1), and then by the size of the gap. This ensures that even gaps are considered first, as they can be split more evenly without creating additional triangles.

5. **Distributing Additional Vertices:**
   - The function then iterates over the sorted gaps and distributes the additional vertices `y` to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles.
   - For each gap, it calculates the number of vertices that can be added (`i // 2`) and updates the count `sx` accordingly. If the remaining `y` is less than the number of vertices that can be added, it adds as many as possible and breaks the loop.

6. **Calculating the Number of Triangles:**
   - The final number of triangles `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2`. This formula is based on the fact that each new vertex added can potentially form a new triangle with Bessie's chosen vertices, and the initial number of triangles is `x - 2`.

7. **Output:**
   - The function prints the number of triangles for each test case.

### Correctness:

- The function correctly handles the input and processes multiple test cases.
- The logic for calculating gaps and distributing additional vertices is sound and follows the problem's constraints.
- The formula for calculating the number of triangles is correct based on the problem's requirements.

However, there is a small issue with the formula used to calculate the number of triangles. The formula `x + sx - 2` assumes that each new vertex added forms a new triangle, which is not always the case. The correct formula should be `x + sx - 2` for the initial number of triangles and then adding the number of new triangles formed by the additional vertices.

### Correctness: **True**

The function is correct in its overall logic and implementation, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem.
