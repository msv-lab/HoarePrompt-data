You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description implies it should be called with arguments that are not defined in the function signature. The correct function signature should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the number of sides of the polygon `n`, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen `x`, the maximum number of other vertices you can choose `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Additionally, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
- **Input:**
  - \( t \): Number of test cases.
  - \( n \): Number of sides of the polygon.
  - \( x \): Number of vertices Bessie has chosen.
  - \( y \): Maximum number of additional vertices you can choose.
  - \( l \): List of \( x \) distinct vertices chosen by Bessie.

- **Output:**
  - For each test case, output the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Key Observations:
1. **Triangulation of a Polygon:**
   - A polygon with \( n \) sides can be triangulated into \( n-2 \) triangles.
   - To maximize the number of triangles, we need to maximize the number of vertices used.

2. **Vertices and Diagonals:**
   - Bessie has chosen \( x \) vertices.
   - You can choose up to \( y \) additional vertices.
   - The total number of vertices used is \( x + y \).

3. **Non-Intersecting Diagonals:**
   - Diagonals must be non-intersecting.
   - The number of triangles formed by \( x + y \) vertices is \( x + y - 2 \).

### Solution Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function uses a lambda function `R` to read integers from input.
   - It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   - It reads the list of \( x \) vertices chosen by Bessie and sorts them.

2. **Handling Vertex List:**
   - The list \( l \) is extended by appending \( n + l[0] \) to handle the circular nature of the polygon.
   - The differences between consecutive vertices are calculated and stored in the list `val`.

3. **Sorting Differences:**
   - The differences are sorted based on a key that prioritizes even differences first and then by the value of the difference.

4. **Maximizing Triangles:**
   - The function iterates over the sorted differences and tries to add as many vertices as possible without exceeding \( y \).
   - For each difference \( i \), it calculates the number of additional vertices that can be added as \( c = i // 2 \).
   - If \( y \) is less than \( c \), it adds \( y * 2 \) to the total number of vertices and breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it adds \( i \) to the total number of vertices and subtracts \( c \) from \( y \).

5. **Calculating the Result:**
   - The total number of vertices used is \( x + sx \).
   - The number of triangles formed is \( x + sx - 2 \).

### Verification:
- **Input Handling:**
  - The input is read and processed correctly.
  - The vertices are sorted and the circular nature is handled by appending \( n + l[0] \).

- **Difference Calculation:**
  - The differences between consecutive vertices are calculated correctly.

- **Sorting and Maximizing:**
  - The sorting key ensures that even differences are prioritized, which is a valid strategy to maximize the number of vertices.
  - The loop correctly adds the maximum number of vertices without exceeding \( y \).

- **Result Calculation:**
  - The final number of triangles is calculated as \( x + sx - 2 \), which is correct based on the triangulation formula.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly handles the input, processes the vertices, and maximizes the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. The logic and implementation are sound.
