The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes the number of sides of a polygon `n`, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen `x`, the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It calculates and prints the number of ways to choose up to `y` additional vertices such that no chosen vertices form a triangle with any of Bessie's chosen vertices. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is that all input has been processed and the corresponding results have been printed.
