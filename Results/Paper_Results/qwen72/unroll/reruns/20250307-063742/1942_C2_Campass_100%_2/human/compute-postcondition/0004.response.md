Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. It returns the number of ways to choose up to `y` additional vertices from the remaining vertices of an `n`-sided polygon, such that the chosen vertices do not form a triangle with any of the vertices Bessie has already chosen. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, with `t` indicating the number of test cases.**
