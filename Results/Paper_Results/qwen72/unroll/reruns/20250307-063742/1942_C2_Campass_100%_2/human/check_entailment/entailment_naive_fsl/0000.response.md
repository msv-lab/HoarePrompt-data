Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 2 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

In this case, Bessie has chosen vertices 1 and 3, and you can choose up to 2 additional vertices. The optimal solution would be to choose vertices 2 and 4, which would result in 3 non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake (1-2-3, 1-3-4, and 2-3-4). However, the program does not correctly compute this and outputs 2 instead.

The issue lies in how the program calculates the number of additional vertices to choose and how it distributes these vertices to maximize the number of triangles. The program's logic for distributing the additional vertices and calculating the number of triangles is not robust enough to handle all edge cases and potential configurations of the chosen vertices.
