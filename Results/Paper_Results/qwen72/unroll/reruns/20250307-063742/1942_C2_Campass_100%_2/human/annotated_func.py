#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description implies it should be called with arguments that are not defined in the function signature. The correct function signature should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the number of sides of the polygon `n`, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen `x`, the maximum number of other vertices you can choose `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Additionally, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, x, y = R()
        
        sx = 0
        
        l = list(R())
        
        l.sort()
        
        l.append(n + l[0])
        
        val = []
        
        for i in range(1, x + 1):
            c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
            val.append(c)
        
        val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
        
        for i in val:
            c = i // 2
            if y < c:
                sx += y * 2
                break
            sx += i
            y -= c
        
        cons = x + sx - 2
        
        print(cons)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and each time it will print a value `cons` calculated based on the inputs `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list `l`. The value of `t` will be decremented to 0, and the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `l` will be updated based on the input provided during each iteration. The initial values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of `x` distinct integers remain unchanged outside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes the number of sides of a polygon `n`, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen `x`, the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It calculates and prints the number of ways to choose up to `y` additional vertices such that no chosen vertices form a triangle with any of Bessie's chosen vertices. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is that all input has been processed and the corresponding results have been printed.
