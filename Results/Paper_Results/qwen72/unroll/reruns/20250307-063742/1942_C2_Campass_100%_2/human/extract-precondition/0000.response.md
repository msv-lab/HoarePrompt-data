Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description implies it should be called with arguments that are not defined in the function signature. The correct function signature should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the number of sides of the polygon `n`, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen `x`, the maximum number of other vertices you can choose `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Additionally, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
