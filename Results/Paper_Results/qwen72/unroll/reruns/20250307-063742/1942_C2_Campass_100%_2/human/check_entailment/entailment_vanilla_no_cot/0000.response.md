Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangles:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of triangles by considering the gaps between the chosen vertices and then trying to fill these gaps with additional vertices. However, the logic for calculating the number of triangles is flawed.
   - The program uses `val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))` to sort the gaps, which is not necessary for the correct solution. The correct approach involves understanding the properties of the polygon and the chosen vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

2. **Handling of Gaps:**
   - The program incorrectly handles the gaps between the chosen vertices. It tries to fill these gaps with additional vertices but does not correctly account for the fact that adding a vertex in a gap can create multiple triangles.
   - The logic `c = i // 2` and `sx += y * 2` is not correct for determining the number of triangles that can be formed by adding vertices in the gaps.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - The final calculation `cons = x + sx - 2` is not correct. The number of triangles formed by a set of vertices in a polygon is not simply the sum of the vertices minus 2. The correct formula for the number of triangles formed by a set of vertices in a polygon is more complex and depends on the specific arrangement of the vertices.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
1. **Understand the Polygon Properties:**
   - A regular polygon with \( n \) sides can be divided into \( n - 2 \) triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.
   - The chosen vertices and the additional vertices you can choose should be used to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles.

2. **Calculate the Maximum Number of Triangles:**
   - For each test case, you need to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed by the chosen vertices and the additional vertices you can choose.
   - This involves considering the gaps between the chosen vertices and determining how many additional vertices can be added to maximize the number of triangles.

3. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The correct implementation should involve a more detailed approach to handling the gaps and calculating the number of triangles.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect and will not produce the correct output for all test cases.
