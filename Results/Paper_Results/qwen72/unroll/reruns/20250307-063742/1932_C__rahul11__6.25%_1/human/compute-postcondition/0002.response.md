Output State: **For each test case, the variable `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` (0 â‰¤ i < n) is the result of the product of the elements in `arr` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) after `i` iterations of the loop, taken modulo `m` and then modulo `MOD`. The values of `l` and `r` are such that `l` starts at 0 and `r` starts at `n-1`, and they are updated in each iteration based on the command in `s`. The variable `c` is equal to `n`, and `ans` is the product of the remaining elements in `arr` after the final iteration, modulo `m` and then modulo `MOD`.**
