Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, representing the initial length of the array a and the value to take the remainder by, respectively. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, representing the elements of the array a. s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', representing the commands to be executed. The sum of the values of n for all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. MOD is 1000000006.**
