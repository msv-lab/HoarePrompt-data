Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 \le t \le 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5 and 1 \le m \le 10^4, representing the initial length of the array a and the value to take the remainder by, respectively. a is a list of n integers such that 1 \le a_i \le 10^4, representing the elements of the array a. s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', representing the commands to be executed. The sum of the values of n for all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot10^5.**
