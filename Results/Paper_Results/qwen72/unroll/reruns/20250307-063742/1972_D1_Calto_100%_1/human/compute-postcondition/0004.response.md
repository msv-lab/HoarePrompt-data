The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are both positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function returns the sum of a specific condition being met for each integer `i` from 1 to `m`. The condition is that the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i))` and `(n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0` is evaluated for each `i`. If the condition is met, it contributes to the sum.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` and returns the total count of a specific condition being met for each integer `i` from 1 to `m`. The condition is that the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i))` and `(n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0` is true for each `i`.**
