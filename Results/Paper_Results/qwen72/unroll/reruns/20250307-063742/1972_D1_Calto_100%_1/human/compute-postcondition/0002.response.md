To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the loop step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- `cnt` is -1.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(1, m + 1):
    x = n - (i * i - i)
    y = i * i
    cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = m`.
   - For each iteration, `x` is calculated as \( n - (i^2 - i) \).
   - `y` is calculated as \( i^2 \).

2. **Update `cnt`**:
   - `cnt` is updated by adding `math.ceil(x / y)` and a boolean value `(x % y == 0)`.
   - `math.ceil(x / y)` is the ceiling of the division of `x` by `y`.
   - `(x % y == 0)` is 1 if `x` is divisible by `y`, and 0 otherwise.

3. **Behavior of `cnt`**:
   - For each `i`, `cnt` is incremented by the ceiling of \( \frac{n - (i^2 - i)}{i^2} \) plus 1 if \( n - (i^2 - i) \) is divisible by \( i^2 \).

### Calculation:
- Let's break down the expression for `cnt`:
  - \( x = n - (i^2 - i) \)
  - \( y = i^2 \)
  - \( \text{term1} = \math.ceil\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \math.ceil\left(\frac{n - (i^2 - i)}{i^2}\right) \)
  - \( \text{term2} = (x \mod y == 0) \)

- The loop updates `cnt` as:
  - \( \text{cnt} = \text{cnt} + \text{term1} + \text{term2} \)

### Final State:
- After the loop finishes, `cnt` will be the sum of all the increments over the range from 1 to `m`.

### Natural Language Description:
- The final value of `cnt` will be the sum of the ceiling of \( \frac{n - (i^2 - i)}{i^2} \) plus 1 if \( n - (i^2 - i) \) is divisible by \( i^2 \) for each `i` from 1 to `m`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` and `m` remain unchanged, `cnt` is the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + (n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0` for `i` from 1 to `m`.**
