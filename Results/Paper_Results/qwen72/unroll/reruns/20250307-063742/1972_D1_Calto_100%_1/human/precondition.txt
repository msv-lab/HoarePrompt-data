It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the provided function definition. The function described in the problem is intended to solve the problem of finding the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions, but the function definition provided is for calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd). Let's correct this and provide the appropriate function definition and precondition.

### Corrected Function Definition
```
def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
```

### Precondition
**n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.**

This precondition ensures that the input values are within the specified range and are positive integers, as required by the problem description.
