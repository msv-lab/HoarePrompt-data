Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is intended to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is correct.
   - However, this function is not used in the main function `func_2`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed. It calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, and then increments `cnt` based on `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`. This does not correctly count the valid pairs.
   - The correct approach should involve iterating over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checking the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
1. Iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
2. For each `b`, iterate over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n`.
3. For each pair `(a, b)`, compute `gcd(a, b)` and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

This program correctly counts the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for each test case.
