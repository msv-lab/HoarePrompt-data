Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\). However, it is not used in the main function `func_2`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is indeed incorrect. The formula used in the loop:
     ```python
     x = n - (i * i - i)
     y = i * i
     cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
     ```
     does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Example Case:
Consider the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\). The valid pairs are:
- \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
- \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\).
- \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).

The correct output for this case should be 3. However, the provided program does not correctly compute this. The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    result = count_valid_pairs(n, m)
    print(result)
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not follow the problem description.

Final: **False**
