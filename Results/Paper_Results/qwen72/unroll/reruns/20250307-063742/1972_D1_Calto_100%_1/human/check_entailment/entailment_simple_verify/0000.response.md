### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\). However, it is not used in the main function `func_2`. This is a significant issue because the problem description requires the use of the GCD to determine if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is incorrect. The formula used in the loop:
     ```python
     x = n - (i * i - i)
     y = i * i
     cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
     ```
     does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The variable `cnt` is initialized to `-1`, which is incorrect. It should be initialized to `0` to correctly count the number of valid pairs.
   - The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not align with the problem's requirement to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be a different calculation that does not solve the given problem.

### Example Case:
Consider the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\). The valid pairs are:
- \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
- \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\).
- \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).

The correct output for this case should be 3. However, the provided program does not correctly compute this. The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly count the number of valid pairs. The GCD function is defined but not utilized, and the formula used in the loop does not match the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
