### Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The Euclidean algorithm is a well-known and efficient method for finding the GCD.
   - This function is not directly used in the main function `func_2`, but it is a standard and correct implementation of GCD.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - The function aims to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The initial value of `cnt` is set to \(-1\), which is unusual and suggests a potential error.
   - The loop iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `x` and `y` as follows:
     - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
     - `y = i * i`
   - It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y)` and checking if `x % y == 0`.
   - The formula used to calculate `x` and `y` is not immediately clear and does not seem to directly relate to the problem's conditions.

4. **Analyzing the Conditions**:
   - For a pair \((a, b)\) to be valid, \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This means there exists an integer \(k\) such that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) or \(a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)\).
   - This implies that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) minus \(b\).

5. **Correctness of the Given Program**:
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to count valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not align with the conditions \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The use of `math.ceil(x / y)` and the check `x % y == 0` does not correctly count the valid pairs.
   - The initial value of `cnt` being \(-1\) is also incorrect, as it should start from 0 to avoid off-by-one errors.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used in `func_2` does not match the required conditions for the pairs \((a, b)\).

Final: **False**
