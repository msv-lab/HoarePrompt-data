### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The function correctly computes the GCD and returns it.

3. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2(n, m)` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The function initializes `cnt` to \(-1\), which is unusual and suggests a potential off-by-one error.
   - The loop iterates over all values of \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - Inside the loop, it calculates:
     - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
     - `y = i * i`
     - `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`
   - The expression `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is intended to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b = i\).

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}
     \]
   - This implies:
     \[
     a \equiv -b \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}
     \]
   - For each \(b = i\), we need to find the number of \(a\) values in the range \([1, n]\) that satisfy this condition.
   - The current implementation in `func_2` does not correctly handle this condition. Specifically, the calculation of `x` and `y` and the subsequent counting logic are not aligned with the problem's requirements.

5. **Issues in `func_2`:**
   - The initialization of `cnt` to \(-1\) is incorrect. It should be initialized to 0.
   - The logic for counting valid pairs is flawed. The expression `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` does not correctly count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b\).

### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the logic in `func_2` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. The initialization of `cnt` to \(-1\) and the subsequent counting logic are both flawed.
