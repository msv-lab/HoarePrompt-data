Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Issues:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\). However, it is not used in the main function `func_2`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is incorrect. The formula used in the loop:
     ```python
     x = n - (i * i - i)
     y = i * i
     cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
     ```
     does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Example Case:
Consider the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\). The valid pairs are:
- \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
- \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\).
- \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).

The correct output for this case should be 3. However, the provided program does not correctly compute this. The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly count the number of valid pairs.
