### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The function correctly returns the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The loop iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It then increments `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
   - The expression `math.ceil(x / y)` counts the number of multiples of \(y\) that are less than or equal to \(x\).
   - The expression `(x % y == 0)` adds 1 to the count if \(x\) is exactly divisible by \(y\).

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \quad \text{for some integer } k
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - For \(a\) to be a valid integer, \(k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1\) must be a positive integer, and \(a\) must be within the range \([1, n]\).

5. **Function `func_2` Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_2` is not directly aligned with the problem statement. Specifically, the calculation of `x` and `y` and the subsequent increment of `cnt` does not seem to correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not directly relate to the GCD condition. It appears to be an incorrect transformation of the problem.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given problem description.
   - Therefore, the program as a whole is incorrect.
