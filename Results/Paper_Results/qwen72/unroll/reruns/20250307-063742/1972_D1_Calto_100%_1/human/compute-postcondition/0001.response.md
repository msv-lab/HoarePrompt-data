The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `1` and `m + 1`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1. The variable `cnt` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. 

Since `n` and `m` are already defined as positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is already greater than or equal to 1, which ensures the loop will execute. However, the initial state of `i` is not specified, and for the loop to start, `i` should be 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1, `i` is 1**
