You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` and returns an integer `cnt`. The value of `cnt` is the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + (n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0` for each integer `i` from 1 to `m`. The function does not modify the input parameters `n` and `m`. After the function concludes, `cnt` represents the total count of a specific condition being met for each `i` in the range from 1 to `m`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The Euclidean algorithm is correct and efficient for finding the GCD.
   - This function is not directly used in the main function `func_2`, but it is a standard and correct implementation of GCD.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - The function aims to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The initial value of `cnt` is set to \(-1\), which is unusual and suggests a potential error.
   - The loop iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `x` and `y` as follows:
     - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
     - `y = i * i`
   - It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y)` and checking if `x % y == 0`.
   - The formula used to calculate `x` and `y` is not immediately clear and does not seem to directly relate to the problem's conditions.

4. **Analyzing the Conditions**:
   - For a pair \((a, b)\) to be valid, \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This means there exists an integer \(k\) such that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) or \(a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)\).
   - This implies that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) minus \(b\).

5. **Correctness of the Given Program**:
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to count valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not align with the conditions \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The use of `math.ceil(x / y)` and the check `x % y == 0` does not correctly count the valid pairs.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used in `func_2` does not match the required conditions for the pairs \((a, b)\).

Correctness: **False**
