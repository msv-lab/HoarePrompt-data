Output State: **The program returns the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + (n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0` for `i` from 1 to `m`. This sum is calculated based on the initial values of `n` and `m`, and it represents the total count of a specific condition being met for each `i` in the range from 1 to `m`.**
