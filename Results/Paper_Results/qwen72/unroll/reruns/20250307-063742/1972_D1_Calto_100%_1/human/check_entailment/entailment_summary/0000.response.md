Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the logic in the given functions:

1. **func_1(a, b)**:
   - This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The function is correct and returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.

2. **func_2(n, m)**:
   - This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The function initializes `cnt` to -1, which is unusual and suggests a potential off-by-one error.
   - It iterates over each integer `i` from 1 to `m` and computes:
     - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
     - `y = i * i`
     - `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`
   - The expression `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is intended to count the number of valid `a` values for a given `b = i`.

However, the logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Let's analyze the condition:

- For a given \(b = i\), we need to find all \(a\) such that \(a + i\) is a multiple of \(i \cdot \gcd(a, i)\).
- This can be rewritten as \(a + i = k \cdot i \cdot \gcd(a, i)\) for some integer \(k\).
- Simplifying, we get \(a = k \cdot i \cdot \gcd(a, i) - i\).
- Since \(a\) must be in the range \([1, n]\), we need to count the number of such \(a\) values.

The current implementation in `func_2` does not correctly handle this condition. Specifically, the expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not align with the required condition. The correct approach would involve iterating over possible values of \(a\) and checking the condition for each \(a\) and \(b\).

Given the incorrect logic in `func_2`, the program does not meet the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
