Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `a` (a list of positive integers), `p` (a list of integers forming a permutation from 1 to n), `s` (a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S)), and `k` (a positive integer). It returns the maximum value that can be computed by adding `k` times the value of `a[s]` to a running sum `cur`, while decrementing `k` and updating `s` to `p[s]` until either `k` reaches 0 or a cycle is detected in the permutation `p`. The final state of the program includes the modified `vis` list (indicating visited indices), the final value of `cur`, and the remaining value of `k`, but the function only returns the maximum value `mx` that was computed during the process. **
