### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the input for each test case.
   - It adjusts the starting positions `pb` and `ps` by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-indexed positions, which is appropriate for the given problem.

2. **Permutation and Array Adjustment:**
   - The program adjusts the elements of the permutation `p` and the array `a` by subtracting 1. However, this adjustment is incorrect. The elements of `p` should remain as they are because they represent positions in the permutation, and the elements of `a` should not be adjusted at all because they represent scores.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the game for a single player starting at position `s` for `k` turns.
   - The function uses a `vis` array to keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops.
   - The loop correctly updates the current score `cur` and the maximum score `mx` based on the current position and the number of remaining turns.
   - The loop also correctly moves the player to the next position in the permutation `p`.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score for a player by considering the score at the current position and the remaining turns.
   - The maximum score `mx` is updated to ensure that the player's score is maximized over the `k` turns.

5. **Output:**
   - The program compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result based on the comparison.

### Issues:
- **Adjustment of `p` and `a`:**
  - The line `p[i] -= 1` and `a[i] -= 1` is incorrect. The elements of `p` should remain as they are, and the elements of `a` should not be adjusted. This adjustment causes the program to calculate incorrect scores.

### Correctness:
- The program is incorrect due to the adjustment of the elements of `p` and `a`. This adjustment leads to incorrect scores being calculated, which affects the final outcome of the game.

### Correctness: **False**
