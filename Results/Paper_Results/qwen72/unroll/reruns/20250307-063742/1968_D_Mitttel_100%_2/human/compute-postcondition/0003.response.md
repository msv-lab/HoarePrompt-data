Output State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, `s` is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S), `k` is a positive integer, `n` is the length of the list `p`, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.**

The list `vis` is initialized to a list of `n` zeros, where `n` is the length of the list `p`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
