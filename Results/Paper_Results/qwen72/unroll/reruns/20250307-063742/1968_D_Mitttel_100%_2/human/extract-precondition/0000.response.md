Precondition: **a and p are lists of integers of the same length n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, s is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The elements of p form a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and the elements of a are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
