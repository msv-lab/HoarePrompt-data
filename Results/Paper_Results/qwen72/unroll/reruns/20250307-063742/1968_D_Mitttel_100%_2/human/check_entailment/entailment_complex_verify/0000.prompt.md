You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and p are lists of integers of the same length n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, s is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The elements of p form a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and the elements of a are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

        s = p[s]
        
    #State: The loop modifies the values of `vis`, `mx`, `cur`, and `k` based on the initial state and the loop's logic.
    return mx
    #The program returns the final value of `mx`, which is the maximum value that `cur` has reached during the execution of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `a` (a list of positive integers), `p` (a list of integers forming a permutation from 1 to n), `s` (a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S)), and `k` (a positive integer). It returns the maximum value that can be computed by adding `k` times the value of `a[s]` to a running sum `cur`, while decrementing `k` and updating `s` to `p[s]` until either `k` reaches 0 or a cycle is detected in the permutation `p`. The final state of the program includes the modified `vis` list (indicating visited indices), the final value of `cur`, and the remaining value of `k`, but the function only returns the maximum value `mx` that was computed during the process.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it updates the scores and the positions of the players. Specifically, the function `func_1` is intended to simulate the game for a player starting at position `s` for `k` turns. However, the logic for updating the maximum score (`mx`) is flawed. The line `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` is intended to calculate the maximum possible score the player can achieve, but it does not correctly account for the fact that the player can choose to stay at the current position or move to the next position in the permutation. This line assumes that the player will stay at the current position for the remaining `k` turns, which is not always the optimal strategy.

Additionally, the program incorrectly modifies the `a` array by subtracting 1 from each element, which is not required by the problem description. The `a` array represents the scores at each position, and these values should not be altered.

A correct implementation would need to properly simulate the game by considering both staying and moving at each turn and choosing the action that maximizes the score. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
