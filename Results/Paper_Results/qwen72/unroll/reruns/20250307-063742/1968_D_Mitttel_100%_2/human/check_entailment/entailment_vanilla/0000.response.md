Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case:
     - The first line contains \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \).
     - The second line contains the permutation \( p \).
     - The third line contains the array \( a \).

2. **Game Rules:**
   - Each player starts at a position \( P_B \) or \( P_S \).
   - On each turn, a player's score increases by \( a_x \) where \( x \) is their current position.
   - The player can either stay at \( x \) or move to \( p_x \).
   - The game lasts \( k \) turns.
   - The player with the higher score after \( k \) turns wins. If scores are equal, it's a draw.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \).
   - It reads the permutation \( p \) and the array \( a \).

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of \( p \) and \( a \) by subtracting 1 from each element. This is necessary because the problem uses 1-based indexing, but Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function simulates the game for a player starting at position \( s \) for \( k \) turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score the player can achieve.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score.
   - It initializes a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops.

4. **Game Simulation:**
   - The while loop runs as long as the current position \( s \) has not been visited and \( k \) is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks the current position \( s \) as visited.
     - It updates `mx` to the maximum of `mx` and the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining \( k \) turns.
     - It adds \( a_s \) to the current score `cur`.
     - It decrements \( k \) by 1.
     - It moves to the next position \( p_s \).

5. **Output:**
   - The program compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha after simulating the game for both.
   - It prints "Draw" if the scores are equal.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher.
   - It prints "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher.

### Issues and Concerns:
1. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The program correctly adjusts the indices of \( p \) and \( a \) by subtracting 1 from each element. However, it also subtracts 1 from the starting positions \( P_B \) and \( P_S \), which is correct.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly simulates the game by considering both staying at the current position and moving to the next position.
   - The use of `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` ensures that the player's score is maximized by considering the best possible score if they stay at the current position for the remaining turns.

3. **Cycle Handling:**
   - The program uses a `vis` list to avoid infinite loops, which is a good approach for handling cycles in the permutation.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( k \) is 0 correctly by not entering the while loop.
   - It also handles the case where the starting positions are the same by correctly simulating the game and comparing the scores.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly simulate the game and determine the winner based on the given rules. It handles the input and output correctly, and the logic for score calculation and cycle detection is sound.

Correctness: **True**
