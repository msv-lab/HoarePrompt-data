Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a` (a list of positive integers), `p` (a list of integers forming a permutation from 1 to n), `s` (a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S)), and `k` (a positive integer). It returns the maximum value that `cur` has reached during the execution of the loop.**
