Initial State: The loop modifies the values of `vis`, `mx`, `cur`, and `k` based on the initial state and the loop's logic.

```
return mx
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate what the program returns. Any variable or value that is included in the return, describe all the information we have for it.

Output State: **The program returns the final value of `mx`, which is the maximum value that `cur` has reached during the execution of the loop.**
