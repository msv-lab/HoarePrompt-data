You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and p are lists of integers of the same length n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, s is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The elements of p form a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and the elements of a are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: The loop modifies the values of `vis`, `mx`, `cur`, and `k` based on the initial state and the loop's logic.
    return mx
    #The program returns the final value of `mx`, which is the maximum value that `cur` has reached during the execution of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a` (a list of positive integers), `p` (a list of integers forming a permutation from 1 to n), `s` (a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S)), and `k` (a positive integer). It returns the maximum value that `cur` has reached during the execution of the loop.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the final value of `mx`, which is the maximum value that `cur` has reached during the execution of the loop.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
