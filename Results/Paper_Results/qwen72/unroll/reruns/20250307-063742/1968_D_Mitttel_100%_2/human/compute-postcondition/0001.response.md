Output State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, `s` is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S), `k` is a positive integer, `n` is the length of the list `p`, `mx` is 0.**

The variable `mx` is initialized to 0, and the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. The lists `a` and `p` still contain integers, `s` is still a tuple of two integers, `k` is still a positive integer, and `n` is still the length of the list `p`.
