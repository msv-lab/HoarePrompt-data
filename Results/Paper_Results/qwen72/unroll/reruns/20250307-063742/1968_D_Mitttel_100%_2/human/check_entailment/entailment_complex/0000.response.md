### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` and initializes the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - It adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indexing, which is a common practice in Python.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the game for a single player starting at position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score the player can achieve.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score of the player.
   - It initializes `vis` to a list of zeros, which will keep track of visited positions to detect cycles.

3. **Game Simulation Loop:**
   - The loop runs while the current position `s` has not been visited (`vis[s] == 0`) and `k` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks the current position `s` as visited.
     - It updates `mx` to be the maximum of `mx` and the current score plus `k` times the value at `a[s]`. This step is intended to account for the possibility of staying in the same position for the remaining turns.
     - It adds the value at `a[s]` to the current score `cur`.
     - It decrements `k` by 1.
     - It updates the current position `s` to `p[s]` to simulate the move to the next position.

4. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The loop correctly detects cycles by marking positions as visited. If a cycle is detected, the loop will terminate early, and the function will return the maximum score `mx` computed so far.

5. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After computing the scores for both Bodya and Sasha using `func_1`, the program compares the scores and prints the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Initialization of `a` and `p`:**
  - The program incorrectly subtracts 1 from the elements of `a`. This is not necessary and can lead to incorrect scores. The elements of `a` should remain as they are, and only the indices of `p` should be adjusted to 0-based indexing.
  - **Correction:** Remove the line `a[i] -= 1`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    return mx
```

### Correctness:
- **True** after the correction mentioned above.
- **False** in the original program due to the incorrect modification of the `a` array.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect modification of the `a` array).
