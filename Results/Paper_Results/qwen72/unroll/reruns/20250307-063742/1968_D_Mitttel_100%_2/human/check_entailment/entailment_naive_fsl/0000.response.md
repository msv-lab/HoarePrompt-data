Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it updates the scores and the positions of the players. Specifically, the function `func_1` is intended to simulate the game for a player starting at position `s` for `k` turns. However, the logic for updating the maximum score (`mx`) is flawed. The line `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` is intended to calculate the maximum possible score the player can achieve, but it does not correctly account for the fact that the player can choose to stay at the current position or move to the next position in the permutation. This line assumes that the player will stay at the current position for the remaining `k` turns, which is not always the optimal strategy.

Additionally, the program incorrectly modifies the `a` array by subtracting 1 from each element, which is not required by the problem description. The `a` array represents the scores at each position, and these values should not be altered.

A correct implementation would need to properly simulate the game by considering both staying and moving at each turn and choosing the action that maximizes the score. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
