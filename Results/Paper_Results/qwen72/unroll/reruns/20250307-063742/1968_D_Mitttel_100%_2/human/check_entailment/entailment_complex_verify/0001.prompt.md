You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and p are lists of integers of the same length n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, s is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.

    #State: The loop modifies the values of `vis`, `mx`, `cur`, and `k` based on the initial state and the loop's logic.
    return mx
    #The program returns the final value of `mx`, which is the maximum value that `cur` has reached during the execution of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `a` (a list of positive integers), `p` (a list of integers forming a permutation from 1 to n), `s` (a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S)), and `k` (a positive integer). It returns the maximum value that can be computed by adding `k` times the value of `a[s]` to a running sum `cur`, while decrementing `k` and updating `s` to `p[s]` until either `k` reaches 0 or a cycle is detected in the permutation `p`. The final state of the program includes the modified `vis` list (indicating visited indices), the final value of `cur`, and the remaining value of `k`, but the function only returns the maximum value `mx` that was computed during the process.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case:
     - The first line contains \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \).
     - The second line contains the permutation \( p \).
     - The third line contains the array \( a \).

2. **Game Rules:**
   - Each player starts at a position \( P_B \) or \( P_S \).
   - On each turn, a player's score increases by \( a_x \) where \( x \) is their current position.
   - The player can either stay at \( x \) or move to \( p_x \).
   - The game lasts \( k \) turns.
   - The player with the higher score after \( k \) turns wins. If scores are equal, it's a draw.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \).
   - It reads the permutation \( p \) and the array \( a \).

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of \( p \) and \( a \) by subtracting 1 from each element. This is necessary because the problem uses 1-based indexing, but Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function simulates the game for a player starting at position \( s \) for \( k \) turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score the player can achieve.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score.
   - It initializes a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops.

4. **Game Simulation:**
   - The while loop runs as long as the current position \( s \) has not been visited and \( k \) is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks the current position \( s \) as visited.
     - It updates `mx` to the maximum of `mx` and the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining \( k \) turns.
     - It adds \( a_s \) to the current score `cur`.
     - It decrements \( k \) by 1.
     - It moves to the next position \( p_s \).

5. **Output:**
   - The program compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha after simulating the game for both.
   - It prints "Draw" if the scores are equal.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher.
   - It prints "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher.

### Issues and Concerns:
1. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The program correctly adjusts the indices of \( p \) and \( a \) by subtracting 1 from each element. However, it also subtracts 1 from the starting positions \( P_B \) and \( P_S \), which is correct.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly simulates the game by considering both staying at the current position and moving to the next position.
   - The use of `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` ensures that the player's score is maximized by considering the best possible score if they stay at the current position for the remaining turns.

3. **Cycle Handling:**
   - The program uses a `vis` list to avoid infinite loops, which is a good approach for handling cycles in the permutation.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( k \) is 0 correctly by not entering the while loop.
   - It also handles the case where the starting positions are the same by correctly simulating the game and comparing the scores.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly simulate the game and determine the winner based on the given rules. It handles the input and output correctly, and the logic for score calculation and cycle detection is sound.
