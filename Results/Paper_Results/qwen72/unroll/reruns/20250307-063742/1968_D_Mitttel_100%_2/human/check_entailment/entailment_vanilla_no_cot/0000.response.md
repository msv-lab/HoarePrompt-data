Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Adjusting `a` Array**: The program adjusts the elements of the `a` array by subtracting 1 from each element. This is incorrect because the elements of `a` should remain as they are. The adjustment should only be applied to the `p` array to convert it to 0-indexed.

2. **Score Calculation**: The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` over `k` turns. However, the logic inside the function is flawed. Specifically, the line `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` is incorrect because it assumes that the player will stay at the current position for the remaining `k` turns, which is not necessarily the optimal strategy. The player might need to move to other positions to maximize the score.

3. **Cycle Detection**: The function `func_1` does not properly handle cycles in the permutation. If a player enters a cycle, the score should be calculated based on the cycle's properties, but the current implementation does not account for this.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the function `func_1` should:

1. **Cycle Detection**: Identify if the player enters a cycle and calculate the score based on the cycle's length and the remaining turns.
2. **Score Calculation**: Simulate the game for the player, considering both staying and moving to the next position, and choose the strategy that maximizes the score.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    scores = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    cur_score = 0
    cur_pos = s
    turn = 0
    
    while k > 0 and not vis[cur_pos]:
        vis[cur_pos] = 1
        cur_score += a[cur_pos]
        scores[turn] = cur_score
        cur_pos = p[cur_pos]
        k -= 1
        turn += 1
    
    if k == 0:
        return cur_score
    
    # If a cycle is detected
    cycle_start = cur_pos
    cycle_length = 0
    cycle_score = 0
    
    while not vis[cur_pos]:
        vis[cur_pos] = 1
        cycle_score += a[cur_pos]
        cur_pos = p[cur_pos]
        cycle_length += 1
    
    # Calculate the score for the remaining turns in the cycle
    full_cycles = k // cycle_length
    remaining_turns = k % cycle_length
    cur_score += full_cycles * cycle_score
    
    for _ in range(remaining_turns):
        cur_score += a[cur_pos]
        cur_pos = p[cur_pos]
    
    return cur_score

# Main program
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1  # Convert to 0-indexed
    
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')
```

This corrected version properly handles the cycle detection and score calculation, ensuring that the program works as intended for the given problem.
