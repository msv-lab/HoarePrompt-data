Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains the same, `t` is 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key from 1 to `n` (inclusive) has a list of integers as its value, representing the nodes it is connected to, `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one element in their value list, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the value of `s`, `prev` is equal to `s`, `curr` is the first element in the list of values for the key `s` in `nodes`.
Code of the loop:
while curr != e:
    tree.append(curr)
    if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][1]
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][0]



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
