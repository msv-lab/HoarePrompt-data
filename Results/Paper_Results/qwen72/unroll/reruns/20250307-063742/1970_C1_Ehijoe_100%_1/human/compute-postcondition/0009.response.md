Output State: `n` remains the same, `t` is 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key from 1 to `n` (inclusive) has a list of integers as its value, representing the nodes it is connected to, and `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one element in their value list.
