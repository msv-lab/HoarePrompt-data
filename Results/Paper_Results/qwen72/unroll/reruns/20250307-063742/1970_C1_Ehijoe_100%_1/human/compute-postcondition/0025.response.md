The function `func_1` does not take any arguments but reads input from standard input (stdin). The input consists of the first line containing two integers `n` and `t`, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5` and `t = 1`. This is followed by `n-1` lines, each containing two integers `u` and `v` (where `1 ≤ u, v ≤ n`), representing an edge in the tree. The last line contains one integer `u_1` (where `1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n`), representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.

The function processes this input and returns the length of the longest path in the tree that starts from the node `u_1`.

Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, consisting of a tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, and a starting node `u_1`. It returns the length of the longest path in the tree starting from `u_1`.**
