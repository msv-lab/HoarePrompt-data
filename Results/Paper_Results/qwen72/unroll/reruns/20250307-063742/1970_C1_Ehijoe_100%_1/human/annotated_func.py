#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any arguments, but it is expected to read input from stdin. The input consists of: the first line containing two integers n and t, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t = 1; followed by n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing an edge in the tree; and the last line containing one integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
def func_1():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    empty = True
    nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        nodes[u].append(v)
        
        nodes[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` remains the same, `t` is 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still True, and `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key from 1 to `n` (inclusive) has a list of integers as its value, representing the nodes it is connected to.
    ends = []
    for key in nodes:
        if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
            ends.append(key)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` remains the same, `t` is 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key from 1 to `n` (inclusive) has a list of integers as its value, representing the nodes it is connected to, and `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one element in their value list.
    s, e = list(ends)
    tree = [s]
    prev = s
    curr = nodes[s][0]
    while curr != e:
        tree.append(curr)
        
        if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
            prev = curr
            curr = nodes[curr][1]
        else:
            prev = curr
            curr = nodes[curr][0]
        
    #State: `tree` is a list containing the nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they are traversed, `prev` is the last node before `e`, `curr` is `e`.
    tree.append(e)
    start = int(input())
    idx = tree.index(start)
    moves = [idx, n - idx - 1]
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: *`tree` is a list containing the nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they are traversed, followed by `e`, `prev` is the last node before `e`, `curr` is `e`, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing `[idx, n - idx - 1]`. If at least one of the elements in `moves` is an odd number, then the condition is true. If all elements in `moves` are even numbers, then the condition is false.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from stdin to construct a tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges. It then identifies the two leaf nodes of the tree and constructs a path from one leaf to the other. Given a starting node `u_1`, the function determines if the number of moves required to reach either end of the path from the starting node is odd or even. If at least one of the moves is odd, it prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value.
