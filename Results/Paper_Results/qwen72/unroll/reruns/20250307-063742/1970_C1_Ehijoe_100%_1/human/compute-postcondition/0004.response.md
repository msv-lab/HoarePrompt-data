To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` will start from 0, as is typical in Python's `range` function.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5.
- `t` is 1.
- `edges` is an empty list.
- `empty` is True.
- `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.

The loop head is:
```
for i in range(n - 1):
```

To ensure the loop executes at least once:
- `n` must be greater than 1 (which it already is, as it is between 2 and 2×10^5).
- `i` will start at 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 0. The other variables and objects do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `i` is 0, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory**
