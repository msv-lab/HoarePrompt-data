Output State: **`tree` is a list containing the nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they are traversed, `prev` is the last node before `e`, `curr` is `e`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop starts with `curr` set to the first element in the list of values for the key `s` in `nodes`.
- The loop continues to append `curr` to the `tree` list and updates `prev` and `curr` until `curr` is equal to `e`.
- At each iteration, `prev` is set to the current value of `curr`, and `curr` is updated to the next node in the path from `s` to `e`.
- The loop terminates when `curr` reaches `e`, meaning that `tree` now contains all the nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they were traversed.
- `prev` will be the node immediately before `e` in the path, and `curr` will be `e` itself.
