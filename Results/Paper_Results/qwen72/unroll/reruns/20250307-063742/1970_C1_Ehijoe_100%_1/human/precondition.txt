The function `testcase` does not take any parameters, but it is expected to read input in the format described in the problem statement. The input consists of: the first line containing two integers n and t, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t=1; the next n-1 lines containing two integers u and v each, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, representing the edges of the tree; and the last line containing a single integer u_1, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
