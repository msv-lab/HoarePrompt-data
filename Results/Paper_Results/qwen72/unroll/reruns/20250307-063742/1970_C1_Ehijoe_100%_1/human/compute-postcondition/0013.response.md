Output State: **`n` remains the same, `t` is 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key from 1 to `n` (inclusive) has a list of integers as its value, representing the nodes it is connected to, `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one element in their value list, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the value of `s`, `prev` is equal to `s`, `curr` is the first element in the list of values for the key `s` in `nodes`.**
