Output State: **`tree` is a list containing the nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they are traversed, followed by `e`, `prev` is the last node before `e`, `curr` is `e`.** 

In natural language: The list `tree` now includes the node `e` appended to the end of the list, which previously contained the nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they were traversed. The variables `prev` and `curr` remain unchanged, with `prev` still being the last node before `e` and `curr` still being `e`.
