Output State: **`n` remains the same, `t` is 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key from 1 to `n` (inclusive) has a list of integers as its value, representing the nodes it is connected to, and `ends` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list called `ends`. The values of `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, and `nodes` remain unchanged.
