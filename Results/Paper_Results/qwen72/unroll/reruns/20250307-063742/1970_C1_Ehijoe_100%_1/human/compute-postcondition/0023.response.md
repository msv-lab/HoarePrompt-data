The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('Hermione')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Hermione'` to the console. The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and objects in the program, but none of these are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is independent of the initial state and will always be the same.

Output: **Hermione**
