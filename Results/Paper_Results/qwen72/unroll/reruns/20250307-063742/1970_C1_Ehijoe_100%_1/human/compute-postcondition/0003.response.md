Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned the values from the first line of input, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, and `t` is 1. `edges` is an empty list. `empty` is True. `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.** 

The `nodes` variable is now a `defaultdict` that uses a list as the default factory for generating default values for keys that are not already present in the dictionary. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
