Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned the values from the first line of input, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, and `t` is 1. The input consists of `n-1` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`), and the last line containing one integer `u_1` (1 ≤ `u_1` ≤ `n`). The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.**
