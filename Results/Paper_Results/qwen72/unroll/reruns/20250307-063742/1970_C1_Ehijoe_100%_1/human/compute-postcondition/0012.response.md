Output State: **`n` remains the same, `t` is 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key from 1 to `n` (inclusive) has a list of integers as its value, representing the nodes it is connected to, `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one element in their value list, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the value of `s`, `prev` is equal to `s`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `prev = s` assigns the value of `s` to `prev`.
- `s` is the first element of `ends`, so `prev` now holds the same value as `s`.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `nodes`, `ends`, `e`, `tree`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
