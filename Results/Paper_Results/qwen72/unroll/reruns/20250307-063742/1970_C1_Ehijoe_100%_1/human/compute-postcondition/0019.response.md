Output State: **`tree` is a list containing the nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they are traversed, followed by `e`, `prev` is the last node before `e`, `curr` is `e`, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing `[idx, n - idx - 1]`**.

Explanation:
- The code snippet `moves = [idx, n - idx - 1]` creates a new list `moves` with two elements.
  - The first element is `idx`, which is the index of `start` in `tree`.
  - The second element is `n - idx - 1`, where `n` is the length of the `tree` list.
- The values of `tree`, `prev`, `curr`, `start`, and `idx` remain unchanged.
- The new list `moves` is added to the output state.
