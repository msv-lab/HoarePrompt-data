Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input from stdin to construct a tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges. It then identifies the two leaf nodes of the tree and constructs a path from one leaf to the other. Given a starting node `u_1`, the function determines if the number of moves required to reach either end of the path from the starting node is odd or even. If at least one of the moves is odd, it prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value. **
