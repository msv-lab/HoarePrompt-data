### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1(n, p)` is designed to simulate the game for a given number of initial players `n` and a sequence of positions `p` to kick out.
   - The `while` loop continues as long as there are still players that can be kicked out based on the positions in `p`.
   - Inside the loop, `sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))` correctly counts the number of positions to kick out in each round.
   - The loop reduces `n` by the number of players kicked out in each round.
   - Once the loop exits, `n` represents the number of players remaining, which is the number of winners.
   - This function is logically correct and accurately simulates the game as described.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2()` reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results.
   - For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to determine the number of winners and appends the result to `res`.
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the print statement should be outside the inner loop to ensure that all results for a test case are printed together.
   - The corrected print statement should be:
     ```python
     print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
     ```
   - This ensures that the results for each test case are printed as a single space-separated string, which is the expected output format.

### Final Correctness:
- The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the print statement in `func_2`.
- The logic of both functions is correct and accurately simulates the game as described.
- After fixing the print statement, the program will correctly solve the problem.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the issue, but the program can be made correct by moving the print statement outside the inner loop.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False** (due to the print statement issue, but the logic is correct)
