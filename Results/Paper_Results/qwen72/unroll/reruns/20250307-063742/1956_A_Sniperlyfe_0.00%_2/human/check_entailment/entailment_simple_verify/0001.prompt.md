You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_k .

In this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds
of this game, the following happens:

  * Nene finds the a_1 -th, a_2 -th, \ldots , a_k -th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i -th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. 

Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are
still in the game are declared as winners.

For example, consider the game with a=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players
be named player A, player B, \ldots , player E in the order they are lined up
initially. Then,

  * Before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round. 
  * Now players are lined up as ABD. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. The 3 -rd player is player D and there is no 5 -th player in a row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round. 
  * In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. 
  * Players A and B are declared as the winners. 

Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene
gave you q integers n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_q and you should answer the following
question for each 1 \le i \le q independently:

  * How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially? 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 250 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line case contains two integers k and q (1 \le k, q \le 100 ) — the
length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this
problem for.

The second line contains k integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k (1\leq
a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_k\leq 100 ) — the sequence a .

The third line contains q integers n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_q (1\leq n_i \leq 100 ).

Output

For each test case, output q integers: the i -th (1\le i \le q ) of them
should be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players
join the game.

Note

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, when n=1 , the only player stays in the game in the
first round. After that, the game ends and the only player is declared as a
winner.

The loop has printed the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` for `t` iterations.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Two integers `k` and `q` representing the length of the sequence `a` and the number of values `n_i` to solve for.
     - A sequence `a` of `k` integers.
     - A list `qs` of `q` integers representing the initial number of players `n_i`.

2. **Output:**
   - For each `n_i` in `qs`, determine the number of players that would be declared as winners if initially `n_i` players join the game.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function takes two parameters: `n` (the initial number of players) and `p` (the sequence of positions to kick out).
   - It uses a `while` loop to continue the game as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
   - Inside the loop, it reduces `n` by the number of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`.
   - Finally, it returns the number of players remaining, which is the number of winners.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results.
   - For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1` to determine the number of winners and appends the result to `res`.
   - It prints the results for each `n` in `qs` after processing all `n` values.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The logic of the function is correct. It correctly simulates the process of kicking out players and counting the remaining players.
   - The `while` loop ensures that the game continues until no more players can be kicked out.
   - The `sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))` correctly counts the number of positions to kick out in each round.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - The results are stored in the list `res` and printed correctly.
   - However, there is a minor issue in the print statement. It should be outside the inner loop to ensure that the results for all `n` values in `qs` are printed together for each test case.

### Corrected Print Statement:
The print statement should be moved outside the inner loop to ensure that all results for a test case are printed together. The corrected function would look like this:

```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Final Correctness:
Given the minor issue in the print statement, the program is almost correct. After fixing the print statement, the program will correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False** (due to the print statement issue, but the logic is correct)
