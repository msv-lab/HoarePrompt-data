### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the process of kicking out players based on the sequence `p` and the initial number of players `n`.
   - The `while` loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`, which is correct because the game should continue until no more players can be kicked out.
   - Inside the loop, the expression `sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))` correctly counts the number of positions to kick out in each round. This is done by iterating over `p` and summing up the number of positions that are less than or equal to `n`.
   - After the loop, the function returns `n`, which is the number of players remaining, and this is the correct number of winners.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results.
   - For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1` to determine the number of winners and appends the result to `res`.
   - The original print statement is inside the inner loop, which means it prints the results for each `n` immediately after it is computed. This is incorrect because the problem requires printing all results for a test case together after processing all `n` values in `qs`.

3. **Corrected Print Statement:**
   - The print statement should be moved outside the inner loop to ensure that all results for a test case are printed together. This is a minor but crucial fix to ensure the output format matches the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the print statement. The logic of the program is otherwise correct. After fixing the print statement, the program will correctly solve the problem as described.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))
    return n

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Final: **False**
- The original program is incorrect due to the print statement issue.
- After fixing the print statement, the program will be correct. However, the question asks for the evaluation of the given program, not the corrected version. Therefore, the final evaluation is **False**.
