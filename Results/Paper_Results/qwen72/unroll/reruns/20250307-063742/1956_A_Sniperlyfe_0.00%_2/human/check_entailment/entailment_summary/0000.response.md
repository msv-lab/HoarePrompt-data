Reasoning:

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` takes two arguments: `n` (the number of players) and `p` (the list of positions to be removed).
   - The function repeatedly reduces `n` by the number of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` until `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`.
   - This correctly simulates the process of removing players from the game according to the positions in `p` until no more players can be removed.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, then the list `p` and the list `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results.
   - For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to `res`.
   - After processing all `n` in `qs`, it prints the results as a space-separated string.

3. **Verification**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for determining the number of winners for a given `n` and `p`.
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results as required by the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `n` is less than the smallest element in `p` by immediately returning `n` without any further reduction.
   - The function also handles the case where `n` is exactly equal to one of the elements in `p` by reducing `n` appropriately.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the problem statement, printing the results for each test case as a space-separated string.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
