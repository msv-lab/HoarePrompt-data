Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the `func_2` function where the `res` list is being printed inside the loop, which will result in incorrect output formatting. The output should be a single line for each test case containing the results for all `n_i` values. Additionally, the `res` list should be reset for each test case. Here is a corrected version of the `func_2` function:

```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

This corrected version ensures that the results for each test case are printed on a single line after all `n_i` values have been processed.
