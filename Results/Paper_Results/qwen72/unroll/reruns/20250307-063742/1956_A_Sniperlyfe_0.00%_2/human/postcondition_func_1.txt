The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 250) from user input, and for each of the `t` test cases, it reads two integers `k` and `q` (1 <= k, q <= 100) and two lists `p` and `qs` from user input. The list `p` contains `k` strictly increasing integers (1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100), and the list `qs` contains `q` integers (1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q). For each integer `n` in `qs`, the function calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to a list `res`. After processing all integers in `qs`, it prints the list `res` as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value.
