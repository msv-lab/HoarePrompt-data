### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
   - The function takes two parameters: `n` (the number of players initially) and `p` (the sequence of integers indicating which players are to be kicked out).
   - The function uses a `while` loop to repeatedly remove players from the game until no more players can be removed based on the sequence `p`.
   - Inside the loop, `n` is decremented by the number of players that should be kicked out (i.e., the sum of `1` for each `x` in `p` where `x <= n`).
   - The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
   - Once the loop exits, the function returns the value of `n`, which represents the number of players remaining in the game.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of integers `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results.
   - For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to determine the number of players remaining in the game and appends the result to `res`.
   - It then prints the results for each `n` in `qs` in a single line, separated by spaces.
   - However, the print statement is inside the loop, which means it will print the results after each iteration of the loop, rather than after all iterations are complete.

### Issues:
- **Print Statement Placement**: The print statement `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))` is inside the loop that iterates over `qs`. This means that the results are printed prematurely after each iteration, rather than after all iterations are complete. This will lead to incorrect output formatting.

### Correctness:
- **False**: The program is incorrect because the print statement is placed inside the loop, causing the results to be printed prematurely. The correct placement would be outside the loop, after all iterations over `qs` are complete.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum(1 for x in p if x <= n)
    return n

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- The print statement `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))` is moved outside the loop that iterates over `qs`. This ensures that the results for all `n` in `qs` are collected and printed together, which is the correct behavior according to the problem description.

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
