Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, k and q are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, p is a list of k integers where 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100, and qs is a list of q integers where 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q. The loop has printed the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` for `t` iterations.**

Explanation:
- The variables `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` retain their initial values as they are re-assigned within each iteration of the loop.
- The loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, it reads new values for `k` and `q`, and new lists for `p` and `qs`.
- For each `n` in `qs`, the result of `func_1(n, p)` is appended to the list `res`, and then `res` is printed.
- After `t` iterations, the loop will have printed the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` for each of the `t` iterations.
