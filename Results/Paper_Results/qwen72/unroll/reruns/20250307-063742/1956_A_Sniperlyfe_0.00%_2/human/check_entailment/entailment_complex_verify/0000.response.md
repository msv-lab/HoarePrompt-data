Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The primary issue with the provided code is that the `res` list is printed inside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs`. This results in premature and incorrect output formatting, as the output for each test case should be a single line containing the results for all `n_i` values. Additionally, the `res` list is not reset for each test case, which could lead to incorrect results if the function processes multiple test cases. The corrected version of `func_2` provided in the original assessment addresses both of these issues by moving the print statement outside the loop and ensuring that `res` is reset for each test case.

Final: **False**
