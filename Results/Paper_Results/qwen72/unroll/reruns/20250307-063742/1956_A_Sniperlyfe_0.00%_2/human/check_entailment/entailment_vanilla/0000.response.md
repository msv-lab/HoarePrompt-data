Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Two integers `k` and `q` representing the length of the sequence `a` and the number of values `n_i` to solve for.
     - A sequence `a` of `k` integers.
     - A list `qs` of `q` integers representing the initial number of players `n_i`.

2. **Output:**
   - For each `n_i` in `qs`, determine the number of players that would be declared as winners if initially `n_i` players join the game.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function takes two parameters: `n` (the initial number of players) and `p` (the sequence of positions to kick out).
   - It uses a `while` loop to continue the game as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
   - Inside the loop, it reduces `n` by the number of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`.
   - Finally, it returns the number of players remaining, which is the number of winners.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results.
   - For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1` to determine the number of winners and appends the result to `res`.
   - It prints the results for each `n` in `qs` after processing all `n` values.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The logic of the function is correct. It correctly simulates the process of kicking out players and counting the remaining players.
   - The `while` loop ensures that the game continues until no more players can be kicked out.
   - The `sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))` correctly counts the number of positions to kick out in each round.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - The results are stored in the list `res` and printed correctly.
   - However, there is a minor issue in the print statement. It should be outside the inner loop to ensure that the results for all `n` values in `qs` are printed together for each test case.

### Corrected Print Statement:
The print statement should be moved outside the inner loop to ensure that all results for a test case are printed together. The corrected function would look like this:

```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Final Correctness:
Given the minor issue in the print statement, the program is almost correct. After fixing the print statement, the program will correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False** (due to the print statement issue, but the logic is correct)
