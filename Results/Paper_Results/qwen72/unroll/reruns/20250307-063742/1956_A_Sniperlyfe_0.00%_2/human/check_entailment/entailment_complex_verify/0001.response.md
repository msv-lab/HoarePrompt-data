### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the process of kicking out players based on the sequence `p` and the initial number of players `n`.
   - The `while` loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`, which ensures that the game continues until no more players can be kicked out.
   - Inside the loop, `n` is reduced by the count of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`. This correctly simulates the removal of players at the specified positions.
   - The function returns the remaining number of players, which is the number of winners. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results for each `n` in `qs`.
   - For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1` to determine the number of winners and appends the result to `res`.
   - The original print statement is inside the inner loop, which means it prints the results for each `n` immediately after calculating it. This is incorrect because it should print all results for a test case together after processing all `n` values in `qs`.

3. **Annotated Code:**
   - The annotations confirm that the state of the program is correctly maintained before and after each function call.
   - The annotations for `func_1` and `func_2` are accurate and align with the problem description and the program logic.

4. **Corrected Print Statement:**
   - Moving the print statement outside the inner loop ensures that all results for a test case are printed together, which is the correct behavior according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the print statement in `func_2`. The logic of `func_1` and the overall structure of `func_2` are correct, but the program as originally written does not print the results in the correct format. After fixing the print statement, the program will correctly solve the problem as described.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False** (due to the print statement issue, but the logic is correct)
