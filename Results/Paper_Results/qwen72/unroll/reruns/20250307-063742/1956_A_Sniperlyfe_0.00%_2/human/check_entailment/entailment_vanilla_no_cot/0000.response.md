Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the `func_2` function. Specifically, the `print` statement is inside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs`, which means it will print the result list `res` after processing each `n`, rather than after processing all `n` values for a given test case. This will lead to incorrect output formatting, as the output should only be printed once for each test case, containing all the results for that test case.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
# Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))
    return n

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

In this corrected version, the `print` statement is moved outside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs`, ensuring that the results for each test case are printed together, as required by the problem description.
