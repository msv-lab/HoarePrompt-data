The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The state before the loop starts already specifies that `1 <= t <= 250`, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `_` is a placeholder variable**
