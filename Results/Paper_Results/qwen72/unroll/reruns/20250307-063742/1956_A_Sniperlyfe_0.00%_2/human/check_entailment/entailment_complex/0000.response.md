Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate a single game with `n` players and a list `p` of positions to kick out.
   - It repeatedly decreases `n` by the count of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` until `n` is less than the minimum value in `p`.
   - This correctly simulates the process of kicking out players and counting the remaining players after each round.
   - The function returns the number of players left, which is the number of winners.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of positions `k` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the list `p` of positions and the list `qs` of initial player counts.
   - For each initial player count `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to determine the number of winners and appends the result to a list `res`.
   - However, the function prints the results of each test case immediately after processing each query, which is incorrect. The results should be printed only after all queries for a test case have been processed.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The problem description specifies that the output should be a single line for each test case containing the results of all queries.
   - The current implementation of `func_2` prints the results of each query as soon as it is computed, which does not match the required output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the output format issue in `func_2`.

Correctness: **False**
