Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1(n, p)` is designed to simulate the rounds of the game for a given number of players `n` and a sequence `p` of positions to be kicked out.
   - The while loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`. This ensures that the game continues until no more players can be kicked out.
   - Inside the loop, `n` is decremented by the number of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`. This correctly simulates the removal of players from the game.
   - The function returns `n` when `n` is less than the minimum value in `p`, which is the correct number of players remaining (i.e., the winners).

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results for each `n_i` in `qs`.
   - The inner loop processes each `n` in `qs` by calling `func_1(n, p)` and appending the result to `res`.
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the `print` statement inside the inner loop results in incorrect output formatting. The `res` list should be printed after all `n_i` values have been processed for a given test case.
   - Additionally, the `res` list should be reset for each test case to avoid mixing results from different test cases.

3. **Corrected Function 2**:
   - The suggested correction moves the `print` statement outside the inner loop and resets `res` for each test case.
   - This ensures that the results for each test case are printed on a single line, as required by the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the logical error in the `func_2` function. The corrected version of `func_2` addresses these issues and should produce the correct output format.

Final: **False**
