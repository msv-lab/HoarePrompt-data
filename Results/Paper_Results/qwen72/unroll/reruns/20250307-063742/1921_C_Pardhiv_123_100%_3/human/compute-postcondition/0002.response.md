Output State: **t = 0, n, f, a, b, ls are reset for each iteration.**

Explanation: The loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 at the end of each iteration. After all iterations are completed, `t` will be 0. Within each iteration, the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are read from user input, and `ls` is constructed based on the input values. These variables (`n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `ls`) are reset for each iteration of the loop. The loop does not modify the values of `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` or any other variables outside the loop. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `t` will be 0, and the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `ls` will be the last set of values read from the input during the final iteration.
