The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then iterates through the list, reducing `f` by the minimum of `a` times the difference between consecutive elements in the list or `b`. After processing, it prints 'YES' if `f` is greater than 0, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function continues this process for all `t` test cases, and upon completion, `t` is 0.
