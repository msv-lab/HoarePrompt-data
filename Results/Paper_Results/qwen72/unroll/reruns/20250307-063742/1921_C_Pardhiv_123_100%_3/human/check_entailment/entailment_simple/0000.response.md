### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It reads the list of moments `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` and prepends a `0` to the list to handle the initial state at moment `0`.

2. **Charge Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through each message moment and calculates the charge left after each message is sent.
   - It uses the formula `f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)` to determine the charge consumption:
     - `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` calculates the charge lost if the phone is on from the previous moment to the current moment.
     - `b` is the charge lost if the phone is turned off and then on again.
     - The `min` function ensures that Stepan chooses the option that consumes the least charge.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all message moments, the program checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than `0`.
   - If `f > 0`, it prints "YES", indicating that Stepan can send all messages.
   - If `f <= 0`, it prints "NO", indicating that Stepan cannot send all messages.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the initial charge `f` is very large and the charge consumption per unit of time `a` is very small, ensuring that the phone can stay on for a long time.
   - It also handles the case where the charge consumption for turning the phone off and on `b` is very large, ensuring that Stepan will not turn off the phone if it is not beneficial.

5. **Integer Overflow:**
   - The program uses Python's built-in integer type, which can handle very large numbers without overflow, as long as the numbers are within the limits of the problem description.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages based on the given constraints. The use of the `min` function ensures that Stepan always chooses the most efficient way to manage the phone's charge. The program also handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
