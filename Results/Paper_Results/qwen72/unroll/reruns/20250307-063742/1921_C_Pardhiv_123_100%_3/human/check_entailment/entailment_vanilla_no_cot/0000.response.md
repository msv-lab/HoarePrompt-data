Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Variables Initialization**: For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` and initializes the list `ls` with the message times, prepending a `0` to handle the initial state at moment `0`.
3. **Charge Calculation**: The program iterates through each message time, calculating the remaining charge `f` by subtracting the minimum of two values:
   - The charge lost by keeping the phone on from the previous message time to the current message time (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`).
   - The charge lost by turning the phone off and on again (`b`).
4. **Final Check**: After processing all messages, it checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than `0`. If it is, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
5. **Loop Control**: The program decrements `t` after each test case and continues until all test cases are processed.

The logic of the program aligns with the problem's requirements and constraints, and it handles the edge cases correctly, such as integer overflow, by using Python's built-in integer type which can handle large numbers without overflow.

Therefore, the program is correct.
