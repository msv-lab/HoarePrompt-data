You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        (n, f, a, b) = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        t -= 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, f, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9, and m_1, m_2, ..., m_n are integers such that 1 <= m_i <= 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        
        ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):

        else:
            print('NO')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: t = 0, n, f, a, b, ls are reset for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then iterates through the list, reducing `f` by the minimum of `a` times the difference between consecutive elements in the list or `b`. After processing, it prints 'YES' if `f` is greater than 0, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function continues this process for all `t` test cases, and upon completion, `t` is 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Stepan has a phone with an initial charge `f`.
   - The phone loses `a` units of charge per unit of time it is on.
   - Turning the phone off and on again consumes `b` units of charge.
   - Stepan needs to send `n` messages at specific moments `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`.

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine if Stepan can send all messages without the charge dropping to 0 or below.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It reads the list of moments `ls` at which messages need to be sent.

2. **Adding a Dummy Moment:**
   - The program adds a dummy moment `0` to the list `ls` to handle the initial state of the phone.

3. **Charge Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through each message moment and calculates the remaining charge `f` after each message.
   - It uses the formula `f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)` to decide whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again:
     - `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` calculates the charge lost if the phone is kept on from the previous moment to the current moment.
     - `b` is the charge lost if the phone is turned off and on again.
     - The `min` function ensures that the phone is turned off and on again if it is more efficient in terms of charge.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all messages, the program checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0.
   - If `f > 0`, it prints "YES".
   - If `f <= 0`, it prints "NO".

### Edge Cases and Considerations:
1. **Initial Charge:**
   - The initial charge `f` is correctly used to start the charge calculation.
   - The dummy moment `0` ensures that the first message is handled correctly.

2. **Charge Consumption:**
   - The charge consumption is calculated correctly using the `min` function.
   - The program ensures that the phone is turned off and on again if it is more efficient.

3. **Test Cases:**
   - The program handles multiple test cases by using a while loop that runs `t` times.

4. **Integer Overflow:**
   - The program uses integer arithmetic, which is generally safe for the given constraints. However, it's important to note that Python's `int` type can handle very large numbers, so integer overflow is not a concern.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages without the charge dropping to 0 or below. It handles the initial setup, charge consumption, and multiple test cases appropriately.
