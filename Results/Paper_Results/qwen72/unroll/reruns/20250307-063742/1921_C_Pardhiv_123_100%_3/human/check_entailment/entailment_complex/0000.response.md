### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It reads the list of message times `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` and prepends a `0` to this list to represent the initial moment.

2. **Charge Calculation:**
   - The function iterates through the list of message times.
   - For each message time `m_i`, it calculates the charge reduction as the minimum of:
     - `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`: the charge lost if the phone remains on from the previous message time to the current message time.
     - `b`: the charge lost if the phone is turned off and then on again at the current message time.
   - This ensures that Stepan can choose the most efficient way to manage the phone's charge.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After processing all message times, the function checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0.
   - If `f > 0`, it prints 'YES', indicating that Stepan can send all messages.
   - If `f <= 0`, it prints 'NO', indicating that Stepan cannot send all messages.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where the initial charge `f` is sufficient to send all messages without turning the phone off.
   - It also handles the case where turning the phone off and on is more efficient than keeping it on.

5. **Integer Overflow:**
   - The function does not explicitly handle integer overflow, but given the constraints (1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9 and 1 <= m_i <= 10^9), the calculations should not exceed the limits of Python's integer type, which can handle arbitrarily large integers.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the input as specified, processes the charge reduction efficiently, and outputs the correct result for each test case. The edge cases and constraints are handled appropriately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
