Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the initial charge `f` is less than the charge required to turn the phone off and on (`b`). In such a scenario, the phone cannot be turned on to send any messages, and the program should output "NO" for all messages. However, the current implementation does not check this condition before starting the loop, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
1 1 1 2
1
```
Here, `n = 1`, `f = 1`, `a = 1`, and `b = 2`. The phone needs to send a message at moment `1`. At moment `0`, the phone has `1` unit of charge. If the phone is turned off and on at any point, it will lose `2` units of charge, which is more than the initial charge. Therefore, Stepan cannot send the message, and the correct output should be "NO". However, the program will output "YES" because it does not check if the initial charge is sufficient to turn the phone off and on.
