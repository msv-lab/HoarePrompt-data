The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array` and `find`. `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ find ≤ n. The function returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the value of `l + 1` converted to a string, where `l` is the index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`. The second string is the value of the index of the first occurrence of `find` in `array` plus 1, also converted to a string.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `find`, and returns a list of two strings. The first string is the index (1-based) of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the index (1-based) of the first occurrence of `find` in `array`.**
