Output State: **The loop will terminate with `l` being the index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and `r` being the index of the last element in `array` that is less than `find`. If `find` is greater than all elements in `array`, `l` will be `n` and `r` will be `n - 1`. If `find` is less than or equal to the first element in `array`, `l` will be `0` and `r` will be `-1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop is a binary search variant that aims to find the position where `find` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `array`.
- If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, the search range is narrowed to the left half by setting `r` to `mid - 1`.
- If `array[mid]` is less than `find`, the search range is narrowed to the right half by setting `l` to `mid + 1`.
- The loop continues until `l` is greater than `r`, at which point `l` will be the index where `find` should be inserted to keep the array sorted, and `r` will be the index just before `l`.
