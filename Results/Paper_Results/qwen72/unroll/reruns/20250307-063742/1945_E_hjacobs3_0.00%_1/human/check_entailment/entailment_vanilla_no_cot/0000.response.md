Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Output Format**: The program does not follow the required output format. It should print the number of operations `k` on the first line for each test case, followed by `k` lines of operations. However, the program prints the number of operations inside the function `func_1` and does not correctly format the output.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in the function `func_1` is incorrect. The condition `if array[mid] >= find:` should be `if array[mid] <= find:` to correctly move the search range. Additionally, the initial values of `l` and `r` should be `1` and `n + 1` respectively, not `0` and `n - 1`.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The program does not handle the swapping logic to ensure that the binary search will find the correct position. It only prints a single swap if the binary search does not find the correct position, but the problem requires up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly.

4. **Function Return Type**: The function `func_1` returns a list of strings, but it should return a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the indices to swap.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    print(len(res))
    for op in res:
        print(' '.join(map(str, op)))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (1, n + 1)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid - 1] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    if array[l - 1] == find:
        return []
    
    # Find the position of the element to be found
    find_pos = array.index(find) + 1
    
    # Determine the necessary swaps
    swaps = []
    if l != find_pos:
        swaps.append([l, find_pos])
        array[l - 1], array[find_pos - 1] = array[find_pos - 1], array[l - 1]
    
    if l != find_pos:
        # Perform a second swap if necessary
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if array[i - 1] != i:
                for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
                    if array[j - 1] == i:
                        swaps.append([i, j])
                        array[i - 1], array[j - 1] = array[j - 1], array[i - 1]
                        break
                break
    
    return swaps
```

This corrected version ensures that the output format is correct, the binary search logic is fixed, and the necessary swaps are performed to ensure the binary search finds the correct position.
