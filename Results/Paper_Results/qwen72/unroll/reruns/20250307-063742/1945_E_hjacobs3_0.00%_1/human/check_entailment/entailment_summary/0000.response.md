Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem of rearranging a permutation to allow a binary search to find a specified number `x` with at most two swaps. However, the provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic. Here are the issues:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_1` is incorrect. The standard binary search should stop when `r - l == 1`, but the function continues the loop as long as `l <= r`. This can lead to incorrect behavior, especially when the target `x` is not in the array.

2. **Output Format**: The function prints the number of swaps directly, which is not the correct format according to the problem description. The number of swaps should be printed outside the function, and the function should return the list of swap operations.

3. **Handling the Permutation**: The function does not actually perform the swaps to rearrange the permutation. It only returns the indices where a swap might be needed, but it does not modify the array.

4. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition `while l <= r` should be `while r - l > 1` to match the problem's binary search termination condition.

5. **Return Value**: The function should return a list of swap operations, but it currently returns a list of indices without performing the swaps.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
