The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The **initial state** describes the conditions of the variables `l` and `r` after a loop has terminated. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not reference any of these variables (`l`, `r`, `array`, `find`, etc.).
- The `print` statement simply prints the integer `1`.

### Output:
Output: **1**
