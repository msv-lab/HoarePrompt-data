### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The program uses a binary search approach to find the position of `x` in the permutation `array`.
   - The binary search loop terminates when `r - l = 1`, which means `l` is the index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `x`, and `r` is the index of the last element in `array` that is less than `x`.

2. **Permutation and Swaps**:
   - The goal is to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search algorithm can correctly find `x`.
   - The program checks if `l` (the index found by binary search) is equal to the index of `x` in the original permutation. If not, it performs a single swap to move `x` to the correct position.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of swaps performed and the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - If no swap is needed, it prints `0`.

4. **Issues**:
   - The binary search implementation in `func_1` is incorrect. The condition `array[mid] >= find` should be `array[mid] <= find` to correctly handle the binary search for a permutation.
   - The program does not handle the case where `x` is not in the permutation, although the problem guarantees that `x` will be in the permutation.
   - The program does not perform the actual swaps in the permutation, it only prints the indices for the swaps.

5. **Correct Binary Search**:
   - The correct binary search should update `l` to `mid + 1` if `array[mid] < find` and `r` to `mid` if `array[mid] >= find`.
   - The loop should terminate when `r - l = 1`.

6. **Swaps**:
   - The program should perform the swaps and then run the binary search again to ensure the correct position of `x`.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The binary search implementation in `func_1` is incorrect. The condition `array[mid] >= find` should be `array[mid] <= find` to correctly handle the binary search for a permutation. Additionally, the program does not perform the actual swaps in the permutation, it only prints the indices for the swaps. This means that the binary search is not run on the modified permutation, which is necessary to ensure the correct position of `x`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
