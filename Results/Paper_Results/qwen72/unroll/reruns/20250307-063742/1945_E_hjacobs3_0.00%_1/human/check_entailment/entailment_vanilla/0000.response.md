Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
- We can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation before running a binary search.
- The binary search algorithm is described as follows:
  1. If `r - l = 1`, end the loop.
  2. Compute `m = (r + l) // 2`.
  3. If `p[m] <= x`, set `l = m`, otherwise set `r = m`.
- The goal is to rearrange the permutation so that after the binary search, `p[l]` is equal to `x`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and then the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes the permutation `array` and the number `find` to be found.
   - It initializes `l` and `r` to `0` and `n-1` respectively.
   - It enters a while loop that continues as long as `l <= r`.
   - Inside the loop, it computes the middle index `mid`.
   - It checks if `array[mid] >= find`. If true, it sets `r = mid - 1`; otherwise, it sets `l = mid + 1`.
   - After the loop, it checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array.
   - If `l` is not the correct index, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the swap needed to correct `l`.
   - If `l` is the correct index, it prints `0`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - For each test case, the program calls `func_1` and prints the result.
   - If `func_1` returns a result, it joins the indices into a string and prints them.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search logic is incorrect. The condition `array[mid] >= find` should be `array[mid] <= find` to correctly narrow down the search range.
   - The loop condition should be `l < r` instead of `l <= r` to avoid infinite loops in certain cases.

2. **Swap Logic:**
   - The program does not perform the actual swaps. It only prints the indices where swaps would be needed.
   - The function `func_1` does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed. It only returns one swap if `l` is not the correct index.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the number of swaps directly inside `func_1`, which is not the correct place according to the problem description. The number of swaps should be printed before the swap indices.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses the issues:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(len(res))
        for swap in res:
            print(' '.join(map(str, swap)))
    else:
        print(0)
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while l < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid
    if l == 0 or array[l-1] != find:
        return [(l, array.index(find) + 1)]
    else:
        return []

def func_2(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while l < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid
    if l == 0 or array[l-1] != find:
        return [(l, array.index(find) + 1)]
    else:
        return []
```

### Explanation:
- **Binary Search Logic:**
  - The condition `array[mid] <= find` is used to correctly narrow down the search range.
  - The loop condition `l < r` ensures the loop terminates correctly.
- **Swap Logic:**
  - If `l` is not the correct index, the function returns a list containing the indices of the swap needed.
  - If `l` is the correct index, the function returns an empty list.
- **Output Format:**
  - The number of swaps is printed before the swap indices.
  - The swap indices are printed in the correct format.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues in the binary search logic and the handling of swap operations. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
