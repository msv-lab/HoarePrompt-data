You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and find is an integer such that 1 ≤ find ≤ n.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
        
    #State: The loop will terminate with `l` being the index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and `r` being the index of the last element in `array` that is less than `find`. If `find` is greater than all elements in `array`, `l` will be `n` and `r` will be `n - 1`. If `find` is less than or equal to the first element in `array`, `l` will be `0` and `r` will be `-1`.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the value of `l + 1` converted to a string, and the second string is the value of the index of the first occurrence of `find` in `array` plus 1, also converted to a string. Note that `l` is the index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and `array.index(find)` is the index of the first occurrence of `find` in `array`.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: The loop will terminate with `l` being the index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and `r` being the index of the last element in `array` that is less than `find`. If `find` is greater than all elements in `array`, `l` will be `n` and `r` will be `n - 1`. If `find` is less than or equal to the first element in `array`, `l` will be `0` and `r` will be `-1`. Additionally, `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `find`. It returns a list of two strings. The first string represents the 1-based index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`. The second string represents the 1-based index of the first occurrence of `find` in `array`. If `find` is not present in `array`, the function still returns the 1-based index of the first element that is greater than or equal to `find`, and the second string will be the 1-based index of the element immediately before `find` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order. The function prints `1` if the index of the first element greater than or equal to `find` is different from the index of `find` in `array`, and `0` otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
- We can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation before running a binary search.
- The binary search algorithm is described as follows:
  1. If `r - l = 1`, end the loop.
  2. Compute `m = (r + l) // 2`.
  3. If `p[m] <= x`, set `l = m`, otherwise set `r = m`.
- The goal is to rearrange the permutation so that after the binary search, `p[l]` is equal to `x`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and then the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes the permutation `array` and the number `find` to be found.
   - It initializes `l` and `r` to `0` and `n-1` respectively.
   - It enters a while loop that continues as long as `l <= r`.
   - Inside the loop, it computes the middle index `mid`.
   - It checks if `array[mid] >= find`. If true, it sets `r = mid - 1`; otherwise, it sets `l = mid + 1`.
   - After the loop, it checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array.
   - If `l` is not the correct index, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the swap needed to correct `l`.
   - If `l` is the correct index, it prints `0`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - For each test case, the program calls `func_1` and prints the result.
   - If `func_1` returns a result, it joins the indices into a string and prints them.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search logic is incorrect. The condition `array[mid] >= find` should be `array[mid] <= find` to correctly narrow down the search range.
   - The loop condition should be `l < r` instead of `l <= r` to avoid infinite loops in certain cases.

2. **Swap Logic:**
   - The program does not perform the actual swaps. It only prints the indices where swaps would be needed.
   - The function `func_1` does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed. It only returns one swap if `l` is not the correct index.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the number of swaps directly inside `func_1`, which is not the correct place according to the problem description. The number of swaps should be printed before the swap indices.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses the issues:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(len(res))
        for swap in res:
            print(' '.join(map(str, swap)))
    else:
        print(0)
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while l < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid
    if l == 0 or array[l-1] != find:
        return [(l, array.index(find) + 1)]
    else:
        return []

def func_2(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while l < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid
    if l == 0 or array[l-1] != find:
        return [(l, array.index(find) + 1)]
    else:
        return []
```

### Explanation:
- **Binary Search Logic:**
  - The condition `array[mid] <= find` is used to correctly narrow down the search range.
  - The loop condition `l < r` ensures the loop terminates correctly.
- **Swap Logic:**
  - If `l` is not the correct index, the function returns a list containing the indices of the swap needed.
  - If `l` is the correct index, the function returns an empty list.
- **Output Format:**
  - The number of swaps is printed before the swap indices.
  - The swap indices are printed in the correct format.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues in the binary search logic and the handling of swap operations. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly according to the problem description.
