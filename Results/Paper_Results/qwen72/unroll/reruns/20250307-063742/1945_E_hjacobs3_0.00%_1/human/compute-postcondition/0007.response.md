Postcondition: **The loop will terminate with `l` being the index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and `r` being the index of the last element in `array` that is less than `find`. If `find` is greater than all elements in `array`, `l` will be `n` and `r` will be `n - 1`. If `find` is less than or equal to the first element in `array`, `l` will be `0` and `r` will be `-1`. Additionally, `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`.**
