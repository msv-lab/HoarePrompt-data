Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the value of `l + 1` converted to a string, and the second string is the value of the index of the first occurrence of `find` in `array` plus 1, also converted to a string. Note that `l` is the index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and `array.index(find)` is the index of the first occurrence of `find` in `array`.**
