Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The original program uses the condition `array[mid] >= find` to decide whether to move the left pointer `l` or the right pointer `r`. This is incorrect because it should be `array[mid] <= find` to correctly narrow down the search range.
   - The loop condition `l <= r` can lead to infinite loops in certain cases. The correct condition should be `l < r` to ensure the loop terminates.

2. **Swap Logic:**
   - The original program does not perform the actual swaps. It only prints the indices where swaps would be needed. This is a significant issue because the problem requires the program to output the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps, not just the indices.
   - The function `func_1` only returns one swap if `l` is not the correct index. However, the problem description states that up to 2 swaps can be performed. The original program does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The original program prints the number of swaps directly inside `func_1`, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, the number of swaps should be printed before the swap indices.

### Corrected Program:
The corrected program provided in the original assessment addresses these issues:

- **Binary Search Logic:**
  - The condition `array[mid] <= find` is used to correctly narrow down the search range.
  - The loop condition `l < r` ensures the loop terminates correctly.

- **Swap Logic:**
  - The function `func_1` returns a list of tuples containing the indices of the swaps needed.
  - If `l` is not the correct index, the function returns a list containing one tuple with the indices of the swap needed.
  - If `l` is the correct index, the function returns an empty list.

- **Output Format:**
  - The number of swaps is printed before the swap indices.
  - The swap indices are printed in the correct format.

### Conclusion:
The original program is indeed incorrect due to the issues in the binary search logic, the handling of swap operations, and the output format. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly according to the problem description.

Final: **False**
