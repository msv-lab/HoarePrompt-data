Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1.** 

The variables `l` and `r` have been initialized to 0 and `n` - 1, respectively. The other variables (`array`, `find`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
