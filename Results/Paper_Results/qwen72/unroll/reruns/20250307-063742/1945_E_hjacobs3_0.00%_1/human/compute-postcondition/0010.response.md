Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `find`. It returns a list of two strings. The first string represents the 1-based index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`. The second string represents the 1-based index of the first occurrence of `find` in `array`. If `find` is not present in `array`, the function still returns the 1-based index of the first element that is greater than or equal to `find`, and the second string will be the 1-based index of the element immediately before `find` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order. The function prints `1` if the index of the first element greater than or equal to `find` is different from the index of `find` in `array`, and `0` otherwise. **
