Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. The loop will terminate with `l` being the index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`.
2. `r` will be the index of the last element in `array` that is less than `find`.
3. If `find` is greater than all elements in `array`, `l` will be `n` (where `n` is the length of `array`) and `r` will be `n - 1`.
4. If `find` is less than or equal to the first element in `array`, `l` will be `0` and `r` will be `-1`.
5. Additionally, `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is simply printing the integer `0`.
- The values of `l`, `r`, `array`, and `find` are not used in the print statement.
- Therefore, the output of the print statement is independent of the initial state and will always be `0`.

### Output:
Output: **0**
