### Reasoning:

Let's break down the original assessment and the provided program to evaluate its correctness.

#### Problem Description:
The problem requires us to find the number `x` in a permutation `p` using a binary search algorithm, but the permutation is not sorted. We are allowed to perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work correctly.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it:
1. Reads the length of the permutation `n` and the number to find `x`.
2. Reads the permutation `array`.
3. Calls the function `func_1` with the permutation and the number to find.
4. Prints the result of `func_1`.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
The function `func_1`:
1. Initializes `l` and `r` to `0` and `n-1` respectively.
2. Performs a binary search to find the position `l` where `array[l]` is the first element greater than or equal to `find`.
3. If `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`, it prints `1` and returns the indices for a single swap to correct the position of `find`.
4. If `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`, it prints `0`.

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_1` is incorrect. The problem statement specifies that the loop should end when `r - l = 1`, but the function uses `l <= r` which can lead to an infinite loop or incorrect results.
2. **Swapping Logic**: The function only performs one swap, but the problem statement allows up to 2 swaps. The function does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed.
3. **Output Format**: The function prints the number of swaps directly, but the problem statement requires the number of swaps to be printed on the first line of the output for each test case, followed by the swap indices on subsequent lines.

#### Specific Case Analysis:
For the input:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
- The correct output should be:
  ```
  2
  4 5
  2 4
  ```
- The actual output from the program is:
  ```
  1
  3 4
  ```

This output is incorrect because:
- The binary search logic in `func_1` does not correctly find the position of `3` in the permutation.
- The function only performs one swap, which is insufficient to ensure the binary search works correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem statement, and it does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed. The output format is also incorrect.

Final: **False**
