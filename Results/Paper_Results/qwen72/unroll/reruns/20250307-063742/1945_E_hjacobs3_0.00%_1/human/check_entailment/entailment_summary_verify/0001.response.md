### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The original function `func_1` has a logical error in the binary search condition. The condition `array[mid] >= find` should be `array[mid] <= find` to correctly narrow down the search range.
   - Additionally, the loop condition `l <= r` should be `l < r` to avoid infinite loops in certain cases.
   - The corrected function `func_1` in the original assessment correctly addresses these issues.

2. **Swap Logic:**
   - The original function `func_1` only returns one swap if `l` is not the correct index. However, the problem description allows for up to 2 swaps.
   - The corrected function `func_1` in the original assessment only returns one swap, which is not sufficient to handle all cases where two swaps might be needed.
   - The function `func_2` is a duplicate of `func_1` and does not add any new functionality. It is unnecessary and does not contribute to solving the problem.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The original program prints the number of swaps directly inside `func_1`, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The number of swaps should be printed before the swap indices.
   - The corrected program in the original assessment correctly prints the number of swaps and the swap indices in the required format.

4. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary provided is not entirely accurate. It states that the function returns the indices of the swap needed, but it does not account for the possibility of needing more than one swap.
   - The function summary also does not clearly state that the function should return the number of swaps and the swap indices in the correct format.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues in the binary search logic and the output format. However, it does not fully address the requirement for up to 2 swaps. The corrected program provided in the assessment is still incomplete because it only handles one swap, which is not sufficient for all test cases.

Given the problem description, the program needs to handle up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search can find the correct element. The provided corrected program does not meet this requirement.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
