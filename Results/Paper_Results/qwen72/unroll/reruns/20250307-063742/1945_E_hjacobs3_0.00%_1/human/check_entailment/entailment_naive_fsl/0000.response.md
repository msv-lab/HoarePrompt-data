Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the binary search logic is flawed, and the program does not handle the case where the element `x` is not present in the array. Additionally, the program does not follow the requirement to output the number of operations and the indices for swapping before the binary search is performed.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
4 5
2 4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
3 4
```

In this case, the program incorrectly outputs only one swap, and the indices for the swap are incorrect. The correct indices should be `4 5` and `2 4` to ensure that the binary search finds the element `3` at the correct position. The program also does not correctly handle the binary search logic, leading to incorrect results.
