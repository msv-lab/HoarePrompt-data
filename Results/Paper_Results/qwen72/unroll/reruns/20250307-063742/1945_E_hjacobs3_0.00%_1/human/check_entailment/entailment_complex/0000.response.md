### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The binary search loop is correctly implemented to find the position `l` where `array[l]` is the first element greater than or equal to `find`.
   - The loop terminates when `r - l = 1`, which ensures that `l` and `r` are adjacent, and `array[l]` is the first element that is greater than or equal to `find`.

2. **Index Comparison**:
   - After the loop, the function checks if `l` is the index of `find` in the array.
   - If `l` is not the index of `find`, it prints `1` and returns a list of two strings representing the indices to swap to move `find` to the correct position.
   - If `l` is the index of `find`, it prints `0` and returns `None`.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function correctly identifies the need to swap the element at position `l` with the element at the position of `find` to ensure that `find` is at the correct position after the binary search.
   - The indices are converted to 1-based indices for the output, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints the number of operations (either `0` or `1`) and returns the indices in the correct format (1-based indices as strings).

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The main loop correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and processing each test case one by one.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where `find` is the first or last element in the array, or when `find` is not present in the array but the binary search still finds the correct position.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 operations before performing a binary search to find the element `x`. The output format and the number of operations are consistent with the problem's requirements.
