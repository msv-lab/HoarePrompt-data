Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in the function `func_1` is slightly incorrect. The condition `if array[mid] >= find:` should be `if array[mid] <= find:` to match the problem description, which states that if `p_m <= x`, then `l = m`, otherwise `r = m`.

2. **Indexing Issue**: The function initializes `l` and `r` as `0` and `n - 1` respectively, which is correct for 0-based indexing in Python. However, the output format requires 1-based indexing, so the function correctly returns `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1`.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The function prints the number of operations required and returns the indices to swap. If `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array, it prints `1` and returns the indices to swap the element at position `l` with the element at the position of `find`. This is a valid approach because it ensures that the element `find` is moved to the correct position where the binary search would find it.

4. **Output Format**: The function correctly prints the number of operations and returns the indices in the required format. However, the function should not print the number of operations directly; it should only return the indices. The printing should be handled outside the function.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The main loop correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and processing each test case one by one.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function should handle the case where the binary search already finds the correct position without any swaps. This is correctly handled by the `else` block, which prints `0` and does not return any indices.

Given these points, the function `func_1` is almost correct, but it has a logical error in the binary search condition and an issue with printing inside the function. The binary search condition should be fixed, and the printing should be moved outside the function.

Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(1)
        print(' '.join(res))
    else:
        print(0)
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    if l != array.index(find):
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
    else:
        return None
```

Correctness: **False**

The original program has a logical error in the binary search condition and an issue with printing inside the function. These issues need to be addressed to make the program correct.
