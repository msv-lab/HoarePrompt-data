Let's break down the reasoning step by step to determine the correctness of the given Python program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and then reads the permutation `array`.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to take the permutation `array` and the number `find` to be found.
   - The function initializes `l` and `r` to 0 and `n-1` respectively, which is incorrect for the binary search algorithm as described in the problem. According to the problem, `l` should be initialized to 1 and `r` to `n + 1`.

3. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop condition `while l <= r` is incorrect. The problem states that the loop should end when `r - l = 1`, so the correct condition should be `while r - l > 1`.
   - Inside the loop, the midpoint `mid` is calculated correctly as `(l + r) // 2`.
   - The comparison and update of `l` and `r` are also incorrect. The problem states:
     - If `p_m <= x`, then `l = m`.
     - If `p_m > x`, then `r = m`.
   - The current implementation uses `array[mid] >= find` to update `r = mid - 1` and `array[mid] < find` to update `l = mid + 1`, which is the opposite of what the problem specifies.

4. **Output**:
   - After the binary search loop, the function checks if `l` is equal to the index of `find` in the array.
   - If not, it prints 1 and returns the indices to swap.
   - If `l` is equal to the index of `find`, it prints 0.
   - The function does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed, which is required by the problem.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the binary search as described in the problem.
   - The function `func_1` does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly.
   - The output format is also incorrect because the function should return the number of operations and the indices to swap, but it prints the number of operations directly.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
