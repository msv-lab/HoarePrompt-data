### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The program implements a binary search algorithm on a permutation array. The binary search is modified to work with a non-sorted permutation by allowing up to 2 swaps to ensure the correct element is found.

2. **Initial Setup**: The program initializes `l` and `r` to 0 and `n-1` respectively, which are the indices of the first and last elements in the array. This is a standard setup for binary search.

3. **Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `l <= r`. Inside the loop, the middle index `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`. The condition `if array[mid] >= find` is used to adjust the search range. If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, the search range is adjusted to the left half by setting `r = mid - 1`. Otherwise, it is adjusted to the right half by setting `l = mid + 1`.

4. **Final State**: After the loop, `l` should be the index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`. This is a key property of the binary search algorithm.

5. **Check and Swap**: The program checks if `l` is the correct index of `find` in the array. If not, it prints 1 and returns a list containing the indices of the elements to be swapped to correct the position of `find`. If `l` is already the correct index, it prints 0, indicating no swaps are needed.

6. **Output Format**: The output format is correct. It prints the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped, which matches the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Binary Search**: The binary search logic is correct for finding the position where `find` should be if the array were sorted. However, the array is a permutation, and the binary search might not directly find the correct index of `find`.

- **Swap Logic**: The program correctly identifies the need to swap elements to place `find` at the correct position. It swaps the element at index `l` with the element at the actual index of `find` in the array. This ensures that `find` is placed in the correct position for the binary search to work.

- **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where `find` is already at the correct position by printing 0 and not performing any swaps.

### Conclusion:

The program is designed to work with permutations and uses binary search with up to 2 swaps to find the correct index of `find`. The logic and the output format are consistent with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
