You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(' '.join(res))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n - 1)
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
    if l != array.index(find):
        print(1)
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
    else:
        print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an array (a permutation of size n consisting of distinct integers from 1 to n) and an integer `find` (1 ≤ find ≤ n). It returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the value of `l + 1` (where `l` is the index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`), and the second string is the value of the index of `find` in `array` plus 1, both converted to strings. If `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`, it prints `1`; otherwise, it prints `0`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the reasoning step by step to determine the correctness of the given Python program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and then reads the permutation `array`.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to take the permutation `array` and the number `find` to be found.
   - The function initializes `l` and `r` to 0 and `n-1` respectively, which is incorrect for the binary search algorithm as described in the problem. According to the problem, `l` should be initialized to 1 and `r` to `n + 1`.

3. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop condition `while l <= r` is incorrect. The problem states that the loop should end when `r - l = 1`, so the correct condition should be `while r - l > 1`.
   - Inside the loop, the midpoint `mid` is calculated correctly as `(l + r) // 2`.
   - The comparison and update of `l` and `r` are also incorrect. The problem states:
     - If `p_m <= x`, then `l = m`.
     - If `p_m > x`, then `r = m`.
   - The current implementation uses `array[mid] >= find` to update `r = mid - 1` and `array[mid] < find` to update `l = mid + 1`, which is the opposite of what the problem specifies.

4. **Output**:
   - After the binary search loop, the function checks if `l` is equal to the index of `find` in the array.
   - If not, it prints 1 and returns the indices to swap.
   - If `l` is equal to the index of `find`, it prints 0.
   - The function does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed, which is required by the problem.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the binary search as described in the problem.
   - The function `func_1` does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly.
   - The output format is also incorrect because the function should return the number of operations and the indices to swap, but it prints the number of operations directly.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
