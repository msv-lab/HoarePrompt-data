Output State: **`l` is the index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and `r` is `l` - 1.**

In natural language, after the loop finishes executing, `l` will point to the index of the first element in the `array` that is greater than or equal to the value of `find`. The variable `r` will be one less than `l`, indicating that the search space has been exhausted and `l` is the correct position where `find` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the array. The other variables (`array`, `find`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
