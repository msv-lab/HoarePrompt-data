Output State: **`array` is a permutation of size `n` consisting of distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the new assignments: `l` is now 0, and `r` is now `n` - 1.
