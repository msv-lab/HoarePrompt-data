Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in the function `func_1` is incorrect. The binary search should be performed on a sorted array, but the problem statement explicitly mentions that the array is a permutation and not sorted. The binary search logic in the function is not designed to handle an unsorted permutation.

2. **Output Format**: The output format is incorrect. The function `func_1` should return the number of operations and the indices of the elements to swap, but it is printing the number of operations directly. This violates the problem's requirement to output the number of operations on the first line and the indices of the swaps in the subsequent lines.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program does not handle the output for multiple test cases correctly. It should print the number of operations and the indices of the swaps for each test case, but it is only printing the indices and the number of operations in some cases.

4. **Swapping Logic**: The program does not implement the logic to perform the swaps before running the binary search. It only checks if the binary search would find the correct index and prints the swap if necessary, but it does not actually perform the swap.

5. **Binary Search Termination Condition**: The termination condition for the binary search in the function `func_1` is incorrect. The loop should terminate when `r - l == 1`, but the current condition `l <= r` will cause the loop to terminate too early or too late.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    target_index = array.index(find)
    
    # Perform binary search
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    # Check if the binary search found the correct index
    if l == target_index:
        print(0)
        return []
    
    # If not, perform the necessary swaps
    operations = []
    if array[l] != find:
        operations.append((l + 1, target_index + 1))
        array[l], array[target_index] = array[target_index], array[l]
    
    if l + 1 < n and array[l + 1] != find:
        operations.append((l + 2, target_index + 1))
        array[l + 1], array[target_index] = array[target_index], array[l + 1]
    
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(*op)
    
    return operations

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(array, x)
    t -= 1
```

This corrected version:
- Finds the target index of the element `x` in the array.
- Performs the binary search correctly.
- Checks if the binary search found the correct index and performs the necessary swaps if it did not.
- Prints the number of operations and the indices of the swaps in the correct format for each test case.
