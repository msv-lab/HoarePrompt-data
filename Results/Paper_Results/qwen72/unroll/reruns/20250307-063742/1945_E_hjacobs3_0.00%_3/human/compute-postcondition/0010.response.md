Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an array (a permutation of size n consisting of distinct integers from 1 to n) and an integer `find` (1 ≤ find ≤ n). It returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the value of `l + 1` (where `l` is the index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`), and the second string is the value of the index of `find` in `array` plus 1, both converted to strings. If `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`, it prints `1`; otherwise, it prints `0`. **
