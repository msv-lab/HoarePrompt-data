### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_1` is flawed. The function should end the loop when `r - l = 1`, but it continues until `l > r`. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when the array is not sorted.
   - The condition `if array[mid] >= find` should be `if array[mid] == find` to correctly identify the target element. However, the problem statement does not require the array to be sorted, and the binary search is applied to an unsorted permutation, which is inherently incorrect for binary search.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints the number of operations directly, which is not in line with the problem description. The problem requires the number of operations to be printed on the first line, followed by the indices of the swaps on subsequent lines.
   - The function should return the number of operations and the indices to swap, but it prints the number of operations and then returns the indices. This is a violation of the problem's output format.

3. **Handling the Condition**:
   - The function does not handle the condition `r - l = 1` correctly. It should end the loop when this condition is met, but it continues to adjust `l` and `r` until `l > r`.
   - The final check `if l != array.index(find)` is not sufficient to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search. The binary search logic itself is flawed and does not guarantee that `l` will be the correct index.

4. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the test case:
     ```
     1
     6 3
     4 3 1 5 2 6
     ```
     - The expected output is:
       ```
       2
       4 5
       2 4
       ```
     - The actual output is:
       ```
       1
       3 4
       ```
     - The program incorrectly prints the number of operations and the indices to swap. The binary search logic does not ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the search, and the output format is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the binary search and swap operations as described in the problem. The binary search logic is flawed, and the output format does not match the problem requirements. The program fails to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search, and it incorrectly prints the number of operations directly instead of returning it.
