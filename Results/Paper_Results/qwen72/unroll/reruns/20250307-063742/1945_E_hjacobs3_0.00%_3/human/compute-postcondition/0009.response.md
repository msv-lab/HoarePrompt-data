The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array` and `find`. `array` is a permutation of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) consisting of distinct integers from 1 to n. `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation. The function returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the value of `l + 1` converted to a string, and the second string is the value of the index of `find` in `array` plus 1, also converted to a string.

Functionality: **The function accepts an array (a permutation of size n consisting of distinct integers from 1 to n) and an integer `find` (1 ≤ find ≤ n). It returns a list of two strings: the first string is `l + 1` (where `l` is not explicitly defined in the constraints), and the second string is the index of `find` in the array plus 1, both converted to strings.**
