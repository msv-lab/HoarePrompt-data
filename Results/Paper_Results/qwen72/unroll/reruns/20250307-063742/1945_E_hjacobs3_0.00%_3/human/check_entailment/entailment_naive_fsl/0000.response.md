Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the binary search and swap operations as described in the problem. Specifically, the binary search logic in `func_1` is flawed. The function should return the number of operations and the indices to swap, but it prints the number of operations directly, which is not in line with the problem description. Additionally, the binary search logic does not correctly handle the condition when `r - l = 1` and does not ensure that the final `p_l` is equal to `x`.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```

Expected Output:
```
2
4 5
2 4
```

Actual Output:
```
1
3 4
```

The program incorrectly prints the number of operations and the indices to swap, and it does not ensure that the final `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search.
