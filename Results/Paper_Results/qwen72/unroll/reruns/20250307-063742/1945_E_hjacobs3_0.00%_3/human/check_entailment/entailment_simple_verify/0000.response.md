### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_1` is flawed. The condition `while l <= r` should be `while r - l > 1` to align with the problem's binary search description, which ends when `r - l = 1`.
   - The current implementation of the binary search does not correctly handle the case when `r - l = 1`. It continues to adjust `l` and `r` even when they are adjacent, which can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Output of Operations**:
   - The function `func_1` prints the number of operations directly, which is not in line with the problem description. The problem requires the number of operations to be printed first, followed by the indices of the swaps.
   - The function should return the number of operations and the indices to swap, and the main loop should handle the printing.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program attempts to swap elements to ensure that the final `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search. However, the logic is incorrect.
   - The program only performs one swap if `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array. This is insufficient because the problem states that up to 2 swaps can be performed to ensure the correct result.

### Specific Case Analysis:

- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  6 3
  4 3 1 5 2 6
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  2
  4 5
  2 4
  ```

- **Actual Output**:
  ```
  1
  3 4
  ```

- **Explanation**:
  - The binary search in `func_1` will set `l` to 2 and `r` to 1, which is incorrect.
  - The program then swaps the elements at indices 2 and 3 (0-based), resulting in the array `[4, 3, 3, 5, 2, 6]`.
  - This swap does not ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search.

### Corrected Approach:

To correct the program, we need to:
1. Adjust the binary search loop to end when `r - l = 1`.
2. Ensure the function returns the number of operations and the indices to swap.
3. Implement a more robust swapping logic to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the binary search and swap operations as described in the problem. The binary search logic is flawed, and the output format does not match the problem requirements. Additionally, the swapping logic is insufficient to ensure the correct result.

Final: **False**
