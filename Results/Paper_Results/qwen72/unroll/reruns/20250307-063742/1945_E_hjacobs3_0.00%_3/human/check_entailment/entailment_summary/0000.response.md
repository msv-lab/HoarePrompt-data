Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of finding the number `x` in a permutation `p` using a modified binary search algorithm, with the possibility of performing up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search can correctly find `x`. However, the implementation of `func_1` in the program is flawed and does not correctly handle the binary search or the swap logic. Here are the issues:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search in `func_1` is incorrect. The standard binary search should adjust the search range based on whether the middle element is less than or greater than the target. However, the current implementation adjusts the range based on whether the middle element is greater than or equal to the target, which is not the correct condition for binary search.

2. **Output Format**: The function `func_1` is supposed to return the number of operations and the indices of the swaps, but it directly prints the number of operations (`1` or `0`) and returns the indices as a list of strings. This does not match the expected output format, which should first print the number of operations and then the indices of the swaps.

3. **Handling the Correct Position**: The function checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array` and performs a swap if they are not equal. This is not a complete solution because it does not ensure that the binary search will find `x` correctly after the swap. The binary search should be able to find `x` in the sorted segment of the permutation, and the swap logic needs to be more sophisticated to ensure this.

4. **Missing Swap Logic**: The function does not perform the actual swap in the array. It only returns the indices where a swap should be made, but the array is not modified, which means the binary search will still run on the original unsorted permutation.

5. **Correctness of Binary Search**: The binary search should be adjusted to correctly find the position of `x` in the permutation. The current implementation will not always find the correct position, especially if `x` is not in the middle of the sorted segment.

6. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and processing each case in a loop. However, the output format for each test case is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.

Given these issues, the program is not correct and does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
