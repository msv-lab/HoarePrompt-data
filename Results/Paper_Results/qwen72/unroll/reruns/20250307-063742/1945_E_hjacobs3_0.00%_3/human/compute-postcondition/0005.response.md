Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `l` is the index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`.
   - `r` is `l` - 1.
   - The current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `1`.
   - The values of `l` and `r` are not used in the `print` statement.
   - The condition that `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array` does not affect the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is printing a constant integer value, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `l` or `r`.

Output: **1**
