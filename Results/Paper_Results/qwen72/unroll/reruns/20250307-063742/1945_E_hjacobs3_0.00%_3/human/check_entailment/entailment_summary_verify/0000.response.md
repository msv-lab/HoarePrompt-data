### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_1` is flawed. The function should ensure that the final `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the condition when `r - l = 1` and does not ensure that the final `p_l` is equal to `x`.
   - The function `func_1` should return the number of operations and the indices to swap, but it prints the number of operations directly, which is not in line with the problem description.

2. **Handling the Binary Search**:
   - The binary search loop should terminate when `r - l = 1`, but the current implementation uses `while l <= r`, which can lead to incorrect termination conditions.
   - The condition `if array[mid] >= find` should be `if array[mid] <= find` to correctly update `l` and `r`.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function should perform the necessary swaps to ensure that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position. The current implementation only checks if `l` is equal to the index of `find` and performs a single swap if they are not equal. This is insufficient to handle all cases where more than one swap is needed.

4. **Example Case Analysis**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     6 3
     4 3 1 5 2 6
     ```
     - The expected output is:
       ```
       2
       4 5
       2 4
       ```
     - The actual output is:
       ```
       1
       3 4
       ```
     - The program incorrectly prints the number of operations and the indices to swap. After the swap, the array becomes `[4, 3, 1, 3, 2, 6]`, which is not a valid permutation and does not ensure that the final `p_l` is equal to `x`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the binary search and swap operations as described in the problem. The binary search logic is flawed, and the function does not return the correct number of operations and indices to swap. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
