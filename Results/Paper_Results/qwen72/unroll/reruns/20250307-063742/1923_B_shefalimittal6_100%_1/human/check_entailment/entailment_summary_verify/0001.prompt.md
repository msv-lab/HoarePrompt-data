You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, x, k):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))
    distance = 0
    pos = 0
    while pos != len(sorted_indices):
        if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
            return False
        rest = k
        while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
            delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
            rest -= delta
            a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
            if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
                pos += 1
        distance += 1
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `x` from the user input. It then calls `func_1(a, x, k)` and prints 'YES' if the result is `True`, or 'NO' if the result is `False`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the value of `t` remains unchanged. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the results for each test case have been printed.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem based on the given description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Two integers `n` and `k` where `n` is the number of monsters and `k` is the number of bullets you can fire per second.
     - An array `a` of size `n` where `a[i]` is the health of the i-th monster.
     - An array `x` of size `n` where `x[i]` is the initial position of the i-th monster.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, print "YES" if you can kill all monsters before any of them reach your character, otherwise print "NO".

3. **Game Mechanics:**
   - Each second, you can fire up to `k` bullets at the monsters.
   - Each bullet decreases the health of a targeted monster by 1.
   - After you fire the bullets, any monster with health 0 or less dies.
   - All surviving monsters move 1 point closer to you.
   - If any monster reaches your character (position 0), you lose.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1: `func_1(a, x, k)`**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the number of monsters `n`.
   - **Step 2:** Sort the indices of the monsters based on their distance from your character (using `abs(x[i])`).
   - **Step 3:** Initialize `distance` to 0 and `pos` to 0.
   - **Step 4:** Use a while loop to process each monster in the sorted order.
     - **Inner Step 1:** Check if the current monster's distance is equal to the current `distance`. If so, return `False` because the monster has reached your character.
     - **Inner Step 2:** Initialize `rest` to `k` (the number of bullets you can fire this second).
     - **Inner Step 3:** Use another while loop to fire bullets at the current monster until it dies or you run out of bullets.
     - **Inner Step 4:** Decrease the health of the current monster and update the `rest` and `pos` accordingly.
     - **Inner Step 5:** Increment the `distance` by 1 to simulate the monsters moving closer.
   - **Step 5:** If all monsters are killed before any of them reach your character, return `True`.

2. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - **Step 1:** Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - **Step 2:** For each test case:
     - Read `n` and `k`.
     - Read the health array `a`.
     - Read the position array `x`.
     - Call `func_1(a, x, k)` and print "YES" if it returns `True`, otherwise print "NO".

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Sorting by Distance:**
   - The program correctly sorts the monsters by their distance from your character using `sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))`. This ensures that you always target the closest monsters first, which is a valid strategy.

2. **Bullet Firing and Monster Movement:**
   - The program correctly simulates the process of firing bullets and moving monsters closer each second.
   - The inner loop ensures that you fire up to `k` bullets per second, and it correctly updates the health of the monsters and the number of bullets remaining.
   - The program correctly checks if a monster has reached your character by comparing `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]])` with `distance`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where a monster reaches your character by returning `False` immediately.
   - The program correctly processes all test cases and prints the appropriate output.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if you can survive and kill all monsters before any of them reach your character. It follows the problem description and handles all the necessary steps and edge cases.
