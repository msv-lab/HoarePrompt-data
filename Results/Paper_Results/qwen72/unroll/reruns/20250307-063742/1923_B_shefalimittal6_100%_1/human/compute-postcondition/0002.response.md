Output State: **The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has executed `t` times. For each iteration, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` are updated based on user input, and the result of `func_1(a, x, k)` is printed as 'YES' or 'NO'. After the loop, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` will hold the values from the last iteration.**
