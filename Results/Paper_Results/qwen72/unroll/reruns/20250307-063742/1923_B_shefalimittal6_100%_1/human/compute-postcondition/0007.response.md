The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, `x`, and `k`. `a` is a list of integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster, and `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bullets you can fire each second. The lengths of `a` and `x` are equal, and for each index `i`, the health `a[i]` is between 1 and 10^9, and the positions `x[i]` are in strictly increasing order with `x[i]` not equal to 0. The function always returns `True`.
