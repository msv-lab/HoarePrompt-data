### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: `a` (list of monster healths), `x` (list of monster positions), `k` (number of bullets per second).
   - **Logic**:
     - The function first sorts the indices of the monsters based on their distance from the character (i.e., the absolute value of their positions).
     - It then iterates through these sorted indices, attempting to kill the monsters in order of their distance from the character.
     - For each monster, it fires up to `k` bullets, reducing the monster's health accordingly.
     - If a monster's health reaches 0, it is considered dead, and the function moves to the next monster.
     - The `distance` variable is incremented at the end of each second to track how close the monsters are to the character.
     - If any monster reaches the character (i.e., its position becomes 0), the function returns `False` (indicating the character cannot survive).
     - If all monsters are killed before any of them reach the character, the function returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: `t` (number of test cases).
   - **Logic**:
     - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the lists `a` and `x`.
     - It then calls `func_1` with these inputs and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns `True`, or 'NO' otherwise.
     - The loop runs `t` times, and the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` are updated for each test case.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that the input values are within the specified ranges.
   - The sorting of indices based on distance is crucial for the strategy of killing the closest monsters first, which is a valid approach given the problem constraints.
   - The program correctly checks if any monster reaches the character before it is killed, which is a key part of the problem.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound. It correctly simulates the process of firing bullets and moving monsters closer each second.
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases in `func_2`.
   - The program's output matches the expected results for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and follows the problem description and constraints accurately. It correctly determines whether the character can survive and kill all the monsters before any of them reach the character.
