You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the health of each monster, x is a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster, and k is a positive integer representing the number of bullets you can fire each second. The lengths of a and x are equal, and for each i, 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9 and -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n with x[i] != 0.

    n = len(a)
    sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))
    distance = 0
    pos = 0
    while pos != len(sorted_indices):
        if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
            return False

                pos += 1
        
        distance += 1
        
    #State: `pos` is equal to the length of `sorted_indices`, `distance` is the number of iterations the loop has run, and all elements in `a` corresponding to indices in `sorted_indices` are reduced by the total number of bullets fired, with some possibly reduced to 0.
    return True
    #The program returns True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the health of each monster, a list of integers `x` representing the initial positions of each monster, and a positive integer `k` representing the number of bullets you can fire each second. The function attempts to reduce the health of each monster to zero by firing bullets in a specific order based on the distance of the monsters from the origin. If at any point a monster's position matches the current distance, the function returns `False`. If all monsters' health can be reduced to zero without any position matching the current distance, the function returns `True`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has executed `t` times. For each iteration, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` are updated based on user input, and the result of `func_1(a, x, k)` is printed as 'YES' or 'NO'. After the loop, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` will hold the values from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `x` from the user input. It then calls `func_1(a, x, k)` and prints 'YES' if the result is `True`, or 'NO' if the result is `False`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the value of `t` remains unchanged. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the results for each test case have been printed.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works for every potential case:

1. **Sorting by Distance**: The function `func_1` sorts the indices of the monsters based on their absolute distance from the character. This ensures that the closest monsters are targeted first, which is crucial because the closest monsters are the ones that will reach the character the soonest.

2. **Distance and Position Handling**: The program maintains a `distance` variable to keep track of how many seconds have passed, and a `pos` variable to track the current position in the sorted list of monsters. It checks if the current monster's distance is equal to the `distance` variable. If it is, the function returns `False` because it means the monster has reached the character.

3. **Bullet Management**: The program uses a `rest` variable to keep track of the remaining bullets that can be fired in the current second. It iterates through the sorted list of monsters, firing bullets at the current monster until it is killed or the bullets run out. This ensures that the maximum number of bullets are used each second to kill the closest monsters first.

4. **Increment Distance**: After each second, the `distance` variable is incremented, and the program moves to the next monster in the sorted list.

5. **Test Case Handling**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually. It reads the input for each test case, calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters, and prints the result.

The program handles edge cases such as:
- When the number of bullets `k` is 1 and there are multiple monsters.
- When the number of bullets `k` is very large and can kill multiple monsters in one second.
- When the monsters are initially very far away and can be killed before reaching the character.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
