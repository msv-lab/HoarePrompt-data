Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `x` from the user input. It then calls `func_1(a, x, k)` and prints 'YES' if the result is `True`, or 'NO' if the result is `False`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the value of `t` remains unchanged. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the results for each test case have been printed. **
