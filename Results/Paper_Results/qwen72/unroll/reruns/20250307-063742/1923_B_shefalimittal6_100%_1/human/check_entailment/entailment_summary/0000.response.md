### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: `a` (health of monsters), `x` (positions of monsters), `k` (bullets per second).
   - **Behavior**:
     - The function sorts the indices of the monsters based on their distance from the origin (0).
     - It then iterates through these sorted indices, attempting to reduce the health of each monster by firing up to `k` bullets per second.
     - If a monster's position matches the current distance (i.e., the monster has reached the origin), the function returns `False`.
     - If all monsters are killed before any of them reach the origin, the function returns `True`.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly handles the logic of firing bullets and checking if any monster reaches the origin.
     - The sorting of monsters by their distance from the origin ensures that the closest monsters are targeted first, which is a valid strategy to prevent any monster from reaching the origin.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: None (reads from user input).
   - **Behavior**:
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the lists `a` and `x`.
     - It calls `func_1(a, x, k)` for each test case and prints 'YES' if the result is `True`, or 'NO' if the result is `False`.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly processes multiple test cases.
     - It reads the input in the format specified by the problem description.
     - It calls `func_1` with the correct parameters and prints the appropriate output based on the result of `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
- The program as a whole correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
- It handles multiple test cases and processes each test case according to the rules of the game.
- The strategy of targeting the closest monsters first is valid and ensures that the character can survive if it is possible to kill all monsters before any of them reach the origin.

### Correctness:
**True**
