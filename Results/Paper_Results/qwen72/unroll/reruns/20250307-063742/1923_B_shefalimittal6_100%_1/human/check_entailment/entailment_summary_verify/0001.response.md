### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(a, x, k)`**
   - **Sorting by Distance:**
     - The function sorts the indices of the monsters based on their distance from the character using `sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))`. This is a valid approach as it ensures that the closest monsters are processed first, which is crucial for survival.
   - **Bullet Firing and Monster Movement:**
     - The function uses a while loop to simulate each second of the game. It correctly checks if the current monster's distance is equal to the current `distance` (i.e., if the monster has reached the character). If so, it returns `False` immediately, which is the correct behavior.
     - The inner while loop ensures that up to `k` bullets are fired each second, and it correctly updates the health of the monsters and the number of bullets remaining.
     - The function increments the `distance` by 1 to simulate the monsters moving closer each second.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - The function correctly handles the case where a monster reaches the character by returning `False`.
     - It also correctly processes all monsters and returns `True` if all monsters are killed before any of them reach the character.

2. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - **Reading Input:**
     - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
     - For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and the number of bullets per second `k`.
     - It reads the health array `a` and the position array `x`.
   - **Calling `func_1` and Printing Results:**
     - The function calls `func_1(a, x, k)` and prints "YES" if the result is `True`, otherwise it prints "NO".
   - **Input Constraints:**
     - The function adheres to the input constraints provided in the problem description, ensuring that the input is valid and processed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if you can survive and kill all monsters before any of them reach your character. It follows the problem description and handles all the necessary steps and edge cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
