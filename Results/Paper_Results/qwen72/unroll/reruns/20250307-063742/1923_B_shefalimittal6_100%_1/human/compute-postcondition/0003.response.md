The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraint provided indicates that there is an integer `t` such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4, which is likely used within the function. Since the output is not specified, we cannot determine the exact return value. However, based on the given constraint, we can infer that the function might return a value or perform an action that depends on the integer `t` within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but operates based on an integer `t` within the range 1 to 30,000. The specific return value or action is not provided, but it likely depends on the value of `t`.**
