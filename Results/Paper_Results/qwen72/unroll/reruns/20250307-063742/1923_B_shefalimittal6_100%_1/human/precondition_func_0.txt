a is a list of integers representing the health of each monster, x is a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster, and k is a positive integer representing the number of bullets you can fire each second. The lengths of a and x are equal, and for each i, 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9 and -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n with x[i] != 0.
