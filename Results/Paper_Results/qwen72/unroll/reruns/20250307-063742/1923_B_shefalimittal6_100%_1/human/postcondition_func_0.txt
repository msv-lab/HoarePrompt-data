The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the health of each monster, a list of integers `x` representing the initial positions of each monster, and a positive integer `k` representing the number of bullets you can fire each second. The function attempts to reduce the health of each monster to zero by firing bullets in a specific order based on the distance of the monsters from the origin. If at any point a monster's position matches the current distance, the function returns `False`. If all monsters' health can be reduced to zero without any position matching the current distance, the function returns `True`.
