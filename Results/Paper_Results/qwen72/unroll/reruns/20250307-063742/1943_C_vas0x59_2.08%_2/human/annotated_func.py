    #The program returns the index of the largest integer in the list `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty list of integers `l` and returns the index of the largest integer in the list. After the function concludes, the list `l` remains unchanged, and the user receives the index of the largest integer in the list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_2` does not take any parameters, but it reads input from the standard input. The input is expected to be a series of test cases, where each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3) representing the number of vertices in the tree, followed by `n - 1` lines, each containing two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing an edge between vertices `u` and `v`. The function constructs an adjacency list `u2vs` for the tree, where `u2vs[u]` contains a list of vertices connected to vertex `u`.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]

        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

        v -= 1

        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, inclusive, and `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains integers representing the indices of the nodes connected to the node at the corresponding index. Each list in `u2vs` will have at least one element, and the total number of elements across all lists will be `2 * (n - 1)`.

    #State: *`path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` to node `0` in reverse order, and `n` is set to `-1`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples where the first element is `c` (the element at the index `ci` in `path_ba`, where `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2) and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2, up to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`.

    #The program returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from the standard input to construct an adjacency list for a tree. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path between two specific nodes in the tree. Based on the length of this path, it generates a list of operations (`ops`) and prints the number of operations followed by the operations themselves. The function returns `None`.
