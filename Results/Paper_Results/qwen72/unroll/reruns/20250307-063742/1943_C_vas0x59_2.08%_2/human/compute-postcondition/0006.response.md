Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, inclusive; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains integers representing the indices of the nodes connected to the node at the corresponding index, and the total number of elements across all lists is `2 * (n - 1)`; `d` is updated to the distances from node 0 to all other nodes in the graph as computed by the `bfs` function; `previous` is a new list containing the previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes in the graph; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `_` is a variable that has been assigned a value, but its specific value is not relevant.**
