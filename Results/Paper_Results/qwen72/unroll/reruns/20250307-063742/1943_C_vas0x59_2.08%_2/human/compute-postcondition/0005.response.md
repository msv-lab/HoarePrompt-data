Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, inclusive, and `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains integers representing the indices of the nodes connected to the node at the corresponding index. Each list in `u2vs` will have at least one element, and the total number of elements across all lists will be `2 * (n - 1)`. `d` is a list containing the distances from node 0 to all other nodes in the graph. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `_` is a variable that has been assigned a value, but its specific value is not relevant.**
