Output State: **The `path_ba` list contains the shortest path from node `b` to node `0` in reverse order, `n` is -1, `ops` is an empty list, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, and the length of `path_ba` is even.**

Explanation: The value of `c1` is set to `c2 - 1`. Since `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and the length of `path_ba` is even, `c1` will be one less than half the length of `path_ba`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
