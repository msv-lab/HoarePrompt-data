The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n - 1`. If `n - 1` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, inclusive, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be initialized before the loop starts.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `_` is not initialized**
