Output State: **The loop modifies the `path_ba` list to contain the shortest path from node `b` to node `0` in reverse order, and the `n` variable is set to `-1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute until it reaches a node where `previous[n]` is `-1`, which indicates the end of the path (i.e., node `0`).
- In each iteration, the loop appends the previous node in the shortest path to the `path_ba` list.
- The `path_ba` list starts with the value of `b` and ends with `0` when the loop terminates.
- The `n` variable is updated in each iteration to the previous node in the path, and it is set to `-1` when the loop breaks.
