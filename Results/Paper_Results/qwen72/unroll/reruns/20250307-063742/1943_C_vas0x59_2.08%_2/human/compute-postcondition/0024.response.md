Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` to node `0` in reverse order.
- `n` is set to `-1`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
  - `ops` contains tuples where the first element is `c` (the element at the index `ci` in `path_ba`, where `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2) and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even:
  - `ops` contains pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2, up to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`.
- The values of `path_ba`, `n`, `c2`, and `c1` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Length of `path_ba`**:
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the structure of `ops` is different from when the length is even.

2. **Odd Length of `path_ba`**:
   - `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.
   - `ops` contains tuples where the first element is `c` (the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`) and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive.
   - For example, if `path_ba = [5, 3, 1, 0]`, the length is 4 (even), so we don't consider this case.
   - If `path_ba = [5, 3, 1]`, the length is 3 (odd), then `ci = 3 // 2 = 1`.
   - `ops` will be `[(3, 0), (3, 1)]`.

3. **Even Length of `path_ba`**:
   - `ops` contains pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2, up to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`.
   - For example, if `path_ba = [5, 3, 1, 0]`, the length is 4 (even), then `c1` and `c2` are the elements at the middle indices.
   - `c1` is the element at index `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1 = 1` and `c2` is the element at index `len(path_ba) // 2 = 2`.
   - `ops` will be `[(3, 1), (1, 1), (3, 3), (1, 3)]`.

4. **Map Function**:
   - The `map` function applies the lambda function to each tuple in `ops`.
   - The lambda function `lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'` takes each tuple `x` and formats it as a string where the first element is incremented by 1 and the second element remains the same.
   - For example, if `ops = [(3, 0), (3, 1)]`, the output will be `['4 0', '4 1']`.

5. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement will print each formatted string on a new line.

### Example Output:
- **Odd Length Example**:
  - `path_ba = [5, 3, 1]`
  - `ops = [(3, 0), (3, 1)]`
  - `map` function output: `['4 0', '4 1']`
  - Final output: 
    ```
    4 0
    4 1
    ```
- **Even Length Example**:
  - `path_ba = [5, 3, 1, 0]`
  - `ops = [(3, 1), (1, 1), (3, 3), (1, 3)]`
  - `map` function output: `['4 1', '2 1', '4 3', '2 3']`
  - Final output:
    ```
    4 1
    2 1
    4 3
    2 3
    ```

### General Output:
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
  - `ci = len(path_ba) // 2`
  - `ops` will contain tuples of the form `(path_ba[ci], i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive.
  - The output will be:
    ```
    path_ba[ci] + 1 0
    path_ba[ci] + 1 1
    ...
    path_ba[ci] + 1 ci
    ```
- If the length of `path_ba` is even:
  - `c1 = path_ba[len(path_ba) // 2 - 1]`
  - `c2 = path_ba[len(path_ba) // 2]`
  - `ops` will contain pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2, up to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`.
  - The output will be:
    ```
    c1 + 1 1
    c2 + 1 1
    c1 + 1 3
    c2 + 1 3
    ...
    c1 + 1 (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)
    c2 + 1 (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)
    ```

### Final Output:
Output: **(c + 1) i for each tuple (c, i) in `ops` (where `c` is the element at the middle index of `path_ba` if the length is odd, and `c1` and `c2` are the elements at the middle indices if the length is even, and `i` ranges as described in the precondition)**
