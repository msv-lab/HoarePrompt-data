Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, inclusive; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains integers representing the indices of the nodes connected to the node at the corresponding index, and the total number of elements across all lists is `2 * (n - 1)`; `d` is updated to the distances from node 0 to all other nodes in the graph as computed by the `bfs` function; `previous` is a new list containing the previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes in the graph; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `_` is a variable that has been assigned a value, but its specific value is not relevant; `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
