To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions provided:

### Given State:
- `path_ba` list contains the shortest path from node `b` to node `0` in reverse order.
- `n` is -1.
- `ops` is an empty list.
- `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
- `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
- The length of `path_ba` is even.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2)` is not empty.
   - For the range to be non-empty, the stop value `len(path_ba) - c1` must be greater than the start value `1`.

2. **Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `i` is the loop variable.
   - `path_ba` is the list whose length is used in the range.
   - `c1` is a variable that affects the stop value of the range.

3. **Dependent Variables**:
   - `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
   - `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Length of `path_ba`**:
   - The length of `path_ba` is even, so let's denote the length of `path_ba` as `2k` where `k` is an integer.
   - Therefore, `c2` is `k` (since `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`).

2. **Value of `c1`**:
   - `c1` is `c2 - 1`, so `c1` is `k - 1`.

3. **Range Condition**:
   - The stop value of the range is `len(path_ba) - c1`.
   - Substituting the values, the stop value is `2k - (k - 1) = k + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `k + 1` must be greater than `1`.
   - Therefore, `k` must be at least `1`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `k` must be at least `1`, the length of `path_ba` must be at least `2`.
   - The initial state of `i` should be `1` (the start value of the range).

### Final Adjusted State:
- `path_ba` must have a length of at least `2`.
- `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, so `c2` is at least `1`.
- `c1` is `c2 - 1`, so `c1` is at least `0`.
- `i` is `1`.

State: **`path_ba` is a list with a length of at least 2, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is 1**
