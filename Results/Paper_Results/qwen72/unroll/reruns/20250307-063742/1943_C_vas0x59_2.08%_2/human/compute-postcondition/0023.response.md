To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ops))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic that constructs the `ops` list.

### Initial State:
- `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` to node `0` in reverse order.
- `n` is set to `-1`.
- The construction of `ops` depends on the length of `path_ba`:
  - If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
    - `ops` contains tuples where the first element is `c` (the element at the index `ci` in `path_ba`, where `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2) and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive.
  - If the length of `path_ba` is even:
    - `ops` contains pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2, up to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Length of `path_ba`:**
   - Let's denote the length of `path_ba` as `L`.

2. **Case 1: Length of `path_ba` is Odd:**
   - `ci` is calculated as `L // 2`.
   - `ops` will contain tuples of the form `(c, i)` where `c` is `path_ba[ci]` and `i` ranges from 0 to `ci` inclusive.
   - The number of tuples in `ops` will be `ci + 1` (since `i` ranges from 0 to `ci`).

3. **Case 2: Length of `path_ba` is Even:**
   - `c1` and `c2` are not explicitly defined in the precondition, but we can infer that they are elements of `path_ba` at specific indices.
   - `ops` will contain pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2, up to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`.
   - The number of pairs in `ops` will be the number of valid `i` values, which is `(L - c1 - 1) // 2`.

### Calculation:
- **Odd Length:**
  - If `L` is odd, `ci = L // 2`.
  - The number of tuples in `ops` is `ci + 1`.
  - Therefore, `len(ops) = (L // 2) + 1`.

- **Even Length:**
  - If `L` is even, the number of pairs in `ops` is `(L - c1 - 1) // 2`.
  - Since `c1` is not explicitly defined, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `len(ops)` without knowing `c1`.

### Final Output:
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the output will be the number of tuples in `ops`, which is `(L // 2) + 1`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even, the output will be the number of pairs in `ops`, which is `(L - c1 - 1) // 2`.

Since the exact values of `c1` and `c2` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is (L // 2) + 1 if the length of `path_ba` is odd, or (L - c1 - 1) // 2 if the length of `path_ba` is even, and L is the length of `path_ba`)**
