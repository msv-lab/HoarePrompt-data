Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input from the standard input to construct an adjacency list for a tree. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path between two specific nodes in the tree. Based on the length of this path, it generates a list of operations (`ops`) and prints the number of operations followed by the operations themselves. The function returns `None`. **
