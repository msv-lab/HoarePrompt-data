Postcondition: ***`path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` to node `0` in reverse order, and `n` is set to `-1`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples where the first element is `c` (the element at the index `ci` in `path_ba`, where `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2) and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` inclusive. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2, up to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`. The values of `path_ba`, `n`, `c2`, and `c1` remain unchanged.***
