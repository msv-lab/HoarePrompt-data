Output State: **The `path_ba` list contains the shortest path from node `b` to node `0` in reverse order, and the length of `path_ba` is an odd number. The `n` variable is set to `-1`. `ops` is an empty list. `ci` is assigned the value of the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2. `c` is the element at the index `ci` in the `path_ba` list.** 

In natural language: The `path_ba` list still contains the shortest path from node `b` to node `0` in reverse order, and its length remains an odd number. The `n` variable is still set to `-1`, and `ops` remains an empty list. The `ci` variable is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and `c` is now the element in `path_ba` at the index `ci`.
