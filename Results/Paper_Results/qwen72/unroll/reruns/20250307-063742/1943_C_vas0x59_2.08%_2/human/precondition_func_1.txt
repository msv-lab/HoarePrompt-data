The function `func_2` does not take any parameters, but it reads input from the standard input. The input is expected to be a series of test cases, where each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3) representing the number of vertices in the tree, followed by `n - 1` lines, each containing two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing an edge between vertices `u` and `v`. The function constructs an adjacency list `u2vs` for the tree, where `u2vs[u]` contains a list of vertices connected to vertex `u`.
