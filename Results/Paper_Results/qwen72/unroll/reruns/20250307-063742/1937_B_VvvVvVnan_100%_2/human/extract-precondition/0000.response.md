Precondition: **The function `func_1` is intended to solve a problem involving a 2 x n grid and multiple test cases, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters, which are necessary to process the input data. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the integer `n` representing the width of the grid, and the two binary strings representing the rows of the grid.** 

However, based on the problem description, the correct function definition should be something like:
```python
def func_1(t, cases):
```
Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. 

For example:
```python
cases = [(2, "00", "00"), (4, "1101", "1100"), (8, "00100111", "11101101")]
```

This would align with the problem's requirements.
