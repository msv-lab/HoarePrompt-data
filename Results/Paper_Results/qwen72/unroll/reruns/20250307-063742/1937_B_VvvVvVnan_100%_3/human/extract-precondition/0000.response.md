Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n for each test case (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5), and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two binary strings of length n, representing the two rows of the grid. The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(t, n_list, grid_list):
```

Where:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- `n_list` is a list of integers, each representing the width of the grid for a test case.
- `grid_list` is a list of tuples, each containing two binary strings representing the rows of the grid for a test case.
