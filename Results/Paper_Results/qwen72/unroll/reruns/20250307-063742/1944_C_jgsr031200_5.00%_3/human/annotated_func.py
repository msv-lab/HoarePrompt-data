#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 0 \le a_i < n \), and \( n \) is the length of the list \( arr \).
def func_1(arr):
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        
        nums[start] -= 1
        
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1
        else:
            print(start + 1)
            return
        
    #State: The `vis` set contains all the indices that were visited during the loop execution, and the `nums` Counter object has the frequencies of the integers in `arr` decremented by the number of times they were encountered in the loop. The `start` variable will be the last index that was processed, and the loop will print `start + 1` and return.
    print(start)
    #This is printed: start (where start is the last index that was processed in the loop)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list. It processes the list to find and print the smallest integer `start + 1` that is not present in the list, or if all integers are present, it prints the last processed integer `start`. The function modifies a `Counter` object to track the frequencies of the integers in `arr` and a set `vis` to track the visited indices. After the function concludes, the `vis` set contains the indices that were visited, and the `Counter` object reflects the decremented frequencies of the integers encountered during the loop.
