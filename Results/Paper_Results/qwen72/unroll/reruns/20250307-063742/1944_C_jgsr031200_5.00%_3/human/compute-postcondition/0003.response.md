To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while nums.get(start, 0):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop condition checks if `nums.get(start, 0)` is truthy. This means that `nums.get(start, 0)` should return a non-zero value for the loop to execute.

Given the program state right before the loop:
- `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 0 \le a_i < n \).
- `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
- `nums` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`.
- `start` is 0.
- `vis` is an empty set.

The key variable in the loop head is `start`, and the loop condition depends on the value of `nums.get(start, 0)`. Since `start` is 0, the loop will execute if `nums.get(0, 0)` returns a non-zero value. This means that the integer 0 must be present in the list `arr` and have a non-zero frequency count in `nums`.

Let's break it down:
1. `start` is 0.
2. `nums.get(start, 0)` will return the frequency count of 0 in `nums`.
3. For the loop to execute, `nums.get(0, 0)` must be greater than 0.

Given that `nums` is a Counter object derived from `arr`, and `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 0 \le a_i < n \), the only way to ensure that `nums.get(0, 0)` is greater than 0 is to ensure that 0 is present in `arr`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that 0 is present in `arr` and has a non-zero frequency count in `nums`.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 0 \le a_i < n \), and \( n \) is the length of the list \( arr \). `nums` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, and `nums.get(0, 0)` must be greater than 0. `start` is 0. `vis` is an empty set.**
