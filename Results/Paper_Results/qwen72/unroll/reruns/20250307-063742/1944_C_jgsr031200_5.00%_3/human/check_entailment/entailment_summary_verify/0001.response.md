### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where Alice tries to maximize the MEX of the array `c` and Bob tries to minimize it.
   - Alice appends elements to `c` and Bob deletes elements from `a`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the array `arr`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It initializes `start` to 0 and `vis` as an empty set.
   - It enters a loop where it checks if the current `start` value is present in the `nums` counter:
     - If `start` is present, it adds `start` to the set `vis` and decreases its count in `nums`.
     - If `start + 1` is also present in `nums`, it decreases the count of `start + 1` in `nums` and increments `start`.
     - If `start + 1` is not present in `nums`, it prints `start + 1` and returns from the function.
   - If the loop exits without finding a missing integer, it prints `start`.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob is to ensure that Alice always appends the smallest missing integer to `c` and Bob always deletes the smallest missing integer from `a`.
   - The program correctly simulates this strategy by checking the smallest integer `start` and ensuring it is added to `c` if possible, and then checking the next integer.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the array `arr` is empty or contains only one element.
   - It also handles the case where all elements in `arr` are the same.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the smallest missing integer by using the `Counter` to keep track of the occurrences of each integer.
   - The loop ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by always considering the smallest missing integer and adjusting the counts accordingly.

However, there is a subtle issue in the original assessment and the function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` does not explicitly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it directly processes the array to find the MEX of the array `c` that would result from the optimal play of both players.
- The function `func_1` assumes that the MEX can be found by simply iterating through the smallest integers and decrementing their counts. This approach is correct for finding the MEX of the final array `c` but does not explicitly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Optimal Play Simulation**:
  - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the MEX of the final array `c` by checking the smallest missing integer.
  - However, it does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. This is not a problem because the MEX of the final array `c` can be determined without explicitly simulating each turn, as long as the final state of `c` is correctly derived.

- **Correctness of the MEX Calculation**:
  - The function `func_1` uses a `Counter` to track the frequencies of the integers in `arr`.
  - It iterates through the smallest integers and decrements their counts, ensuring that the smallest missing integer is found.
  - This approach is efficient and correct for finding the MEX of the final array `c`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles edge cases correctly:
    - If `arr` is empty, the MEX is 0.
    - If `arr` contains all the same elements, the MEX is the next integer after the repeated element.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly simulates the game and finds the MEX of the array `c` when both players play optimally. The function `func_1` efficiently and correctly identifies the smallest missing integer, which is the MEX of the final array `c`.

Final: **True**
