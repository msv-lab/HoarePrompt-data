The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list. It processes the list to find and print the smallest integer `start + 1` that is not present in the list, or if all integers are present, it prints the last processed integer `start`. The function modifies a `Counter` object to track the frequencies of the integers in `arr` and a set `vis` to track the visited indices. After the function concludes, the `vis` set contains the indices that were visited, and the `Counter` object reflects the decremented frequencies of the integers encountered during the loop.
