Reasoning:  
The provided Python program is designed to solve a game problem where Alice and Bob take turns to manipulate an array `a` to achieve a certain MEX score. The program reads multiple test cases, processes each array, and prints the MEX score for each case. The function `func_1` is the core of the solution, which uses a `Counter` to track the frequency of each element in the array and a set to track visited elements. However, the set `vis` is not actually used in the logic of the function, so it can be considered redundant.

The logic of `func_1` is as follows:
1. It initializes a `Counter` object to count the occurrences of each element in the array.
2. It starts with `start = 0` and enters a loop where it checks if the current `start` value is in the `Counter` (i.e., if it is present in the array).
3. If `start` is present, it adds `start` to the set `vis` (which is not used) and decrements its count in the `Counter`.
4. If `start + 1` is also present in the `Counter`, it decrements its count and increments `start`.
5. If `start + 1` is not present, it prints `start + 1` and returns, as this is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array `c` (which is implicitly constructed by the removal of elements from `arr`).

The program is designed to simulate the optimal play of Alice and Bob. Alice will always try to pick the smallest available integer that can help maximize the MEX score, and Bob will try to pick the smallest available integer that can help minimize the MEX score. The function `func_1` effectively captures this strategy by always checking the smallest integer and ensuring that it is either picked by Alice or Bob, depending on its presence and the next smallest integer.

However, there is a logical issue in the function:
- The function assumes that Bob will always pick the smallest available integer, which is not necessarily true. Bob's optimal strategy is to minimize the MEX score, and he might choose to pick a different integer to disrupt Alice's strategy.

To correct this, the function should consider the optimal strategy for both players:
- Alice should always pick the smallest integer that can help maximize the MEX.
- Bob should always pick the smallest integer that can help minimize the MEX, but he should also consider the impact of his choice on the remaining elements.

The current implementation does not fully capture Bob's optimal strategy, which can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is not correct for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
