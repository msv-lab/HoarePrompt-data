Reasoning:

The given problem involves a game between Alice and Bob where they take turns picking elements from an array `a` and Alice appends her chosen elements to another array `c`. The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` after the game ends, assuming both players play optimally.

### Key Points in the Problem:
1. **MEX Definition**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
2. **Optimal Play**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
3. **Turns**: Alice starts first, and each player picks one element from `a` in their turn. Alice appends the element to `c`, and Bob simply removes the element from `a`.

### Analysis of the Annotated Program:
- **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the array `arr` for each test case.
- **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the array `arr`.

### Function `func_1`:
- **Counter Initialization**: `nums = c.Counter(arr)` creates a frequency counter for the elements in `arr`.
- **Initial MEX Check**: `start = 0` initializes the variable to check for the MEX starting from 0.
- **Loop Execution**:
  - The loop `while nums.get(start, 0):` continues as long as the current `start` value is present in the array.
  - `vis.add(start)` adds the current `start` value to the set `vis` (though `vis` is not used in the final solution, it is not harmful).
  - `nums[start] -= 1` decrements the frequency of the current `start` value.
  - If `start + 1` is present in the array (`if nums.get(start + 1, 0):`), it decrements the frequency of `start + 1` and increments `start`.
  - If `start + 1` is not present, it prints `start + 1` and returns, which is the MEX of the array `c` at that point.

### Correctness of the Algorithm:
- **Optimal Play**: The algorithm correctly simulates the optimal play for both Alice and Bob. Alice will always try to append the smallest available integer to `c` to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to remove the smallest available integer to minimize the MEX.
- **MEX Calculation**: The loop ensures that the smallest integer not present in `c` is found and printed, which is the MEX of `c`.

### Issues:
- **Unused Variables**: The variable `vis` is not used in the final solution, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.
- **Redundant Code**: The commented-out functions `build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, and `dfs` are not used in the solution and can be ignored.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. The core logic in `func_1` is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
