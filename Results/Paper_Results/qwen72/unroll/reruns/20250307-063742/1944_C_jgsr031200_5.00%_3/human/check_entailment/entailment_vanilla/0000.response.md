### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where Alice tries to maximize the MEX of the array `c` and Bob tries to minimize it.
   - Alice appends elements to `c` and Bob deletes elements from `a`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the array `arr`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It initializes `start` to 0 and `vis` as an empty set.
   - It enters a loop where it checks if the current `start` value is present in the `nums` counter:
     - If `start` is present, it adds `start` to the set `vis` and decreases its count in `nums`.
     - If `start + 1` is also present in `nums`, it decreases the count of `start + 1` in `nums` and increments `start`.
     - If `start + 1` is not present in `nums`, it prints `start + 1` and returns from the function.
   - If the loop exits without finding a missing integer, it prints `start`.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice and Bob will play optimally, meaning Alice will always try to append the smallest missing integer to `c` to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to delete the smallest missing integer to minimize the MEX.
   - The program correctly simulates this strategy by checking the smallest integer `start` and ensuring it is added to `c` if possible, and then checking the next integer.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the array `arr` is empty or contains only one element.
   - It also handles the case where all elements in `arr` are the same.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the smallest missing integer by using the `Counter` to keep track of the occurrences of each integer.
   - The loop ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by always considering the smallest missing integer and adjusting the counts accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly simulates the game and finds the MEX of the array `c` when both players play optimally.

Correctness: **True**
