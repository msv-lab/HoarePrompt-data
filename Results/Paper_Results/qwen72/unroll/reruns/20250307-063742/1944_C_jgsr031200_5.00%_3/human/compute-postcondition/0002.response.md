Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 0 \le a_i < n \), and \( n \) is the length of the list \( arr \). `nums` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`. `start` is 0. `vis` is an empty set.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `vis` is now an empty set.
