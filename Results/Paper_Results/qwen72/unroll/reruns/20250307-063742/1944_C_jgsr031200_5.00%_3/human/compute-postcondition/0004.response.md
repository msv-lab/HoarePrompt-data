Output State: **The `vis` set contains all the indices that were visited during the loop execution, and the `nums` Counter object has the frequencies of the integers in `arr` decremented by the number of times they were encountered in the loop. The `start` variable will be the last index that was processed, and the loop will print `start + 1` and return.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as the current `start` index has a non-zero count in the `nums` Counter.
- Each time the loop runs, it adds the current `start` index to the `vis` set.
- It then decrements the count of the integer at the `start` index in the `nums` Counter.
- If the integer at `start + 1` also has a non-zero count, it decrements that count and increments `start` by 1.
- If the integer at `start + 1` has a zero count, the loop prints `start + 1` and returns, effectively ending the loop.
- The `vis` set will contain all the indices that were processed, and the `nums` Counter will reflect the decremented counts of the integers in `arr` that were encountered during the loop execution.
