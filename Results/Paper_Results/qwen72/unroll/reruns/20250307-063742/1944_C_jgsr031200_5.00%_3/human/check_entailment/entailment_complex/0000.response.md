Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. The optimal strategy for Alice is to select elements that will maximize the MEX of `c`, and for Bob, it is to minimize the MEX of `c`.

The provided function `func_1` aims to simulate this process by:
1. Counting the frequencies of each integer in `arr` using `collections.Counter`.
2. Iterating through the integers starting from 0, and for each integer `start`:
   - If `start` is present in `arr`, it is added to the set `vis` and its count in `nums` is decremented.
   - If `start + 1` is also present in `arr`, its count in `nums` is decremented, and `start` is incremented.
   - If `start + 1` is not present in `arr`, the function prints `start + 1` and returns, as this is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `arr`.

However, there are a few issues with the function:
1. The function does not explicitly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it directly processes the array to find the MEX, which is a valid approach but not the same as simulating the game.
2. The function does not handle the case where all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in `arr`. In such a case, the MEX should be `n`, but the function will print the last processed integer `start`, which might not be `n`.

Let's analyze the function step by step:
- The `Counter` object `nums` correctly counts the frequencies of each integer in `arr`.
- The loop iterates through the integers starting from 0, and for each integer `start`, it checks if `start` is present in `arr` and decrements its count.
- If `start + 1` is present, it decrements its count and increments `start`.
- If `start + 1` is not present, it prints `start + 1` and returns, which is the correct MEX.

However, the function does not handle the edge case where all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in `arr`. In this case, the loop will continue until `start` is `n-1`, and it will print `n-1` instead of `n`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the function prints `n` if all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in `arr`.

Corrected function:
```python
import collections as c

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(arr)

def func_1(arr):
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while start < n and nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        nums[start] -= 1
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1
        else:
            print(start + 1)
            return
    print(n)
```

With this correction, the function will handle the edge case correctly and print `n` if all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in `arr`.

Given the original function, it is incorrect due to the edge case handling issue.

Correctness: **False**
