Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` attempts to simulate the game by counting the occurrences of each number in the array and then iterating through the numbers to determine the MEX. However, this approach does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob, which are crucial to solving the problem.

Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Simulation of Turns:**
   - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. It simply iterates through the numbers and decrements their counts, which does not reflect the game's rules where Alice and Bob take turns and Alice wants to maximize the MEX while Bob wants to minimize it.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The MEX calculation in the program is incorrect. The program does not correctly handle the case where Bob might choose a number that affects the MEX in a way that minimizes it. The program assumes a linear progression through the numbers, which is not necessarily the optimal strategy for either player.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob involves more complex decision-making. Alice should always try to add the smallest number that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX, while Bob should try to remove the smallest number that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX. The program does not implement this strategy.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array might have repeated elements or where the array is very small (e.g., `n = 1`).

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed to simulate the optimal strategies of both players. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import collections as c

def find_mex(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    mex = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if nums[i] == 0:
            return i
    return n + 1

def game_score(n, arr):
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    mex = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if nums[i] == 0:
            mex = i
            break
        elif nums[i] == 1:
            nums[i] = 0
            mex = i + 1
            break
    return mex

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(game_score(n, arr))
```

**Explanation of the Corrected Program:**

1. **Counting Elements:**
   - We use a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each number in the array.

2. **Finding the MEX:**
   - We iterate through the numbers from 0 to `n` to find the smallest number that is not in the array. This is the MEX.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - We simulate the game by considering the optimal moves for both players. If a number `i` is not in the array, it becomes the MEX. If a number `i` appears exactly once, Alice will pick it, and the MEX will be `i + 1`.

This corrected program should correctly determine the game's score based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
