**Reasoning:**

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not accurately simulate the game as described. The function `func_1` is attempting to find the MEX of the array `arr` but does not consider the turn-based nature of the game where Alice and Bob play optimally to maximize and minimize the score, respectively.

Let's break down the function `func_1`:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `nums = c.Counter(arr)`: This creates a frequency counter for the elements in `arr`.
   - `start = 0`: This initializes the starting point for finding the MEX.
   - `vis = set()`: This set is used to track visited indices, but it is not necessary for finding the MEX in this context.

2. **Loop to find MEX:**
   - The loop continues until `nums.get(start, 0)` is zero, meaning the current `start` value is not present in `arr`.
   - `vis.add(start)`: This adds the current `start` to the visited set, which is not relevant to the game logic.
   - `nums[start] -= 1`: This decrements the frequency of the current `start` value.
   - If `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is non-zero, it decrements the frequency of `start + 1` and increments `start`.
   - If `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is zero, it prints `start + 1` and returns.

The function `func_1` is essentially finding the MEX of the array `arr` by checking the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array. However, it does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns, and it does not consider their optimal strategies.

To correctly simulate the game, we need to:
- Simulate Alice's and Bob's turns.
- Ensure Alice always picks an element to maximize the MEX.
- Ensure Bob always picks an element to minimize the MEX.

The provided function `func_1` does not do this. Instead, it simply finds the MEX of the array without considering the turn-based nature of the game.

**Example Case Analysis:**

For the input:
```
1
4
0 1 2 2
```

The expected output is 3, as explained in the original assessment. However, the provided function `func_1` outputs 1, which is incorrect.

**Correct Approach:**

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game with the following steps:
1. Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `arr`.
2. Alice always picks the smallest element that is not yet in `c` and is available in `arr`.
3. Bob always picks the smallest element available in `arr` to minimize the MEX of `c`.

A correct implementation would involve a more complex simulation of the game, considering the optimal strategies of both players.

**Final Evaluation:**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly simulate the game and does not follow the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

Final: **False**
