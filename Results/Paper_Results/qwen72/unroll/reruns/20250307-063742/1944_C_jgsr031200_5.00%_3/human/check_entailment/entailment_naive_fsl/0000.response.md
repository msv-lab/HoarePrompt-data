Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob correctly. Instead, it seems to be attempting to find the MEX in a way that does not consider the optimal strategies of both players.

Here is a potential case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0 1 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- Alice can start by picking 2, so `c = [2]` and `a = [0, 1, 2]`.
- Bob picks 0, so `c = [2]` and `a = [1, 2]`.
- Alice picks 1, so `c = [2, 1]` and `a = [2]`.
- Bob picks 2, so `c = [2, 1]` and `a = []`.

The MEX of `c = [2, 1]` is 3, which is the correct output.

However, the provided program outputs 1, which is incorrect. This indicates that the program does not correctly simulate the game and does not follow the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
