To determine what will be printed by the `print(start)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **`vis` set**: This set contains all the indices that were visited during the loop execution.
2. **`nums` Counter object**: This object has the frequencies of the integers in `arr` decremented by the number of times they were encountered in the loop.
3. **`start` variable**: This variable will be the last index that was processed in the loop.

Given these conditions, the `print(start)` statement will print the value of `start`, which is the last index that was processed in the loop.

Since the exact loop logic and the contents of `arr` are not provided, we can only describe `start` in terms of the loop execution. The value of `start` will be the last index that the loop processed before it terminated.

Output: **start (where start is the last index that was processed in the loop)**
