Output State: **The `trumps` list is empty. The `answers` list and the `suits` dictionary remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the `trumps` list is not empty. In each iteration, the loop removes two elements from the `trumps` list using `trumps.pop()`. Since the loop will keep running until `trumps` is empty, after all iterations, the `trumps` list will be empty. The `answers` list and the `suits` dictionary are not modified within the loop, so they retain their initial states.
