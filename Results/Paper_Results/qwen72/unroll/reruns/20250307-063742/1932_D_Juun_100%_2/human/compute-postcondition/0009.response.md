Output State: **The `trumps` list is now sorted in descending order. The `answers` list will still contain the pairs of cards that were matched and removed. The `suits` dictionary will still have `None` for all suits that had at least one card matched and removed, and the remaining unmatched ranks for any suits that did not have a match.**
