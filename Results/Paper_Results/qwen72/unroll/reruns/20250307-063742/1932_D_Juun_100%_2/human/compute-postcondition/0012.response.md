The only objects in the loop head are the variable `answer` and the list `answers`. The loop will execute if the `answers` list is not empty. Since the `trumps` list is empty and does not affect the loop's execution, it does not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute, the `answers` list must contain at least one element. The state of `answer` will be the first element in the `answers` list at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`trumps` list is empty, `answers` list must have at least 1 element, `answer` is the first element in the `answers` list**
