#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept three parameters: the number of rounds `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), the trump suit `trump` (one of "CDHS"), and a list of 2n unique card strings `cards` where each card string is two characters long, the first character being the rank (one of "23456789") and the second character being the suit (one of "CDHS").
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: The `trumps` list contains the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit. The `answers` list contains strings representing pairs of cards that were matched and removed, each string formatted as "rank1 suit rank2 suit". The `suits` dictionary will have `None` for all suits that had at least one card matched and removed, and the remaining unmatched ranks for any suits that did not have a match.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: The `trumps` list will be empty if there were enough trump cards to pair with all remaining ranks in the `suits` dictionary. The `answers` list will contain the pairs of cards that were matched and removed. The `suits` dictionary will have `None` for all suits that had at least one card matched and removed, and the remaining unmatched ranks for any suits that did not have a match.
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: The `trumps` list is empty. The `answers` list and the `suits` dictionary remain unchanged.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The `trumps` list is empty. The `answers` list and the `suits` dictionary remain unchanged. The loop has printed each element in the `answers` list to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from the user to determine the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit `trump`, and a list of 2n unique card strings. It then processes these cards to find pairs of cards that can be matched and removed, either by matching cards of the same suit or by using trump cards. If there are enough trump cards to pair with all remaining unmatched cards, it prints the pairs. If not, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and exits. Finally, it prints any remaining pairs of cards that were matched and removed. The function does not return any value.
