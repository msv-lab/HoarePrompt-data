The only objects in the loop head are the variables `suit` and `rank`, and the dictionary `suits`. For the loop to execute, the dictionary `suits` must contain at least one key-value pair where the value is not `None`. This is because the loop iterates over the key-value pairs of the `suits` dictionary, and if all values are `None`, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the `suits` dictionary to have at least one key with a value that is not `None`.

State: **`trumps` list contains the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit, `answers` list contains strings representing pairs of cards that were matched and removed, `suits` dictionary must have at least one suit with a value that is not `None`, `suit` is the first suit key in the dictionary, `rank` is the first non-`None` value associated with the `suit` key**
