The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `trump`, and `cards`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of rounds, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 16.
- `trump` is a string representing the trump suit, which can be one of "C", "D", "H", or "S".
- `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings, where each card string is two characters long. The first character represents the rank (one of "23456789"), and the second character represents the suit (one of "C", "D", "H", or "S").

The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept these parameters and return a result based on the number of rounds, the trump suit, and the list of unique card strings.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), a string `trump` (one of "C", "D", "H", "S"), and a list of 2n unique card strings `cards` where each card string is two characters long (the first character being the rank and the second character being the suit). The function returns a result based on these inputs.**
