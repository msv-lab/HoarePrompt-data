Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input from the user to determine the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit `trump`, and a list of 2n unique card strings. It then processes these cards to find pairs of cards that can be matched and removed, either by matching cards of the same suit or by using trump cards. If there are enough trump cards to pair with all remaining unmatched cards, it prints the pairs. If not, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and exits. Finally, it prints any remaining pairs of cards that were matched and removed. The function does not return any value. **
