You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept three parameters: the number of rounds `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), the trump suit `trump` (one of "CDHS"), and a list of 2n unique card strings `cards` where each card string is two characters long, the first character being the rank (one of "23456789") and the second character being the suit (one of "CDHS").
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: The `trumps` list contains the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit. The `answers` list contains strings representing pairs of cards that were matched and removed, each string formatted as "rank1 suit rank2 suit". The `suits` dictionary will have `None` for all suits that had at least one card matched and removed, and the remaining unmatched ranks for any suits that did not have a match.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: The `trumps` list will be empty if there were enough trump cards to pair with all remaining ranks in the `suits` dictionary. The `answers` list will contain the pairs of cards that were matched and removed. The `suits` dictionary will have `None` for all suits that had at least one card matched and removed, and the remaining unmatched ranks for any suits that did not have a match.
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: The `trumps` list is empty. The `answers` list and the `suits` dictionary remain unchanged.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The `trumps` list is empty. The `answers` list and the `suits` dictionary remain unchanged. The loop has printed each element in the `answers` list to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), a string `trump` (one of "C", "D", "H", "S"), and a list of 2n unique card strings `cards` where each card string is two characters long (the first character being the rank and the second character being the suit). The function returns a result based on these inputs.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
