The function `func` is designed to process multiple test cases. Each test case consists of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. The function accepts the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and for each test case, it accepts the dimensions of the board `h` and `w` (1 ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9), and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` (1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w) with the guarantee that the initial positions do not coincide (either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b).

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters. However, the specific output for each case is not provided in the constraints and relationships, so we cannot describe the exact return value without that information.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with board dimensions `h` and `w`, and initial chip positions `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. It returns a result for each test case, but the specific output based on the input parameters is not provided.**
