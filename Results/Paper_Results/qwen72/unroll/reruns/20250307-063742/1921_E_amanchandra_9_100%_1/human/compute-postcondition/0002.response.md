Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read six integers from the input and print either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the conditions in the loop. The values of `t`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will be consumed and not retained between iterations. After all iterations, the initial state of the variables outside the loop will remain unchanged.**
