You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. The input is structured as follows: the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `h` and `w` are the dimensions of the board (1 ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9), and `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w) with the guarantee that the initial positions do not coincide (either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b).

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read six integers from the input and print either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the conditions in the loop. The values of `t`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will be consumed and not retained between iterations. After all iterations, the initial state of the variables outside the loop will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each involving a game board with dimensions `h` and `w`, and initial positions of two chips, Alice's chip at `(x_a, y_a)` and Bob's chip at `(x_b, y_b)`. For each test case, it reads the input values, performs a series of calculations based on the positions of the chips, and prints either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' depending on the conditions. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly outputs the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function consumes the input values and does not retain any state between iterations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Board Dimensions**: The board has `h` rows and `w` columns.
2. **Initial Positions**: Alice's chip is at `(x_a, y_a)` and Bob's chip is at `(x_b, y_b)`.
3. **Moves**:
   - Alice can move to `(x_a + 1, y_a)`, `(x_a + 1, y_a - 1)`, or `(x_a + 1, y_a + 1)`.
   - Bob can move to `(x_b - 1, y_b)`, `(x_b - 1, y_b - 1)`, or `(x_b - 1, y_b + 1)`.
4. **Winning Conditions**:
   - A player wins if they move to a cell occupied by the other player's chip.
   - The game ends in a draw if a player cannot make a move (Alice at the last row, Bob at the first row).
5. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board dimensions `r` and `w`, and the initial positions `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - If `a > c`, it prints "Draw". This is because if Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip, Alice cannot move up to Bob's chip, and Bob cannot move down to Alice's chip. The game will end in a draw.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - If `a <= c`, it calculates `x = abs(a - c) // 2`. This is the number of turns it takes for Alice and Bob to potentially meet in the middle of the board.
   - If `abs(a - c) % 2 == 1` (i.e., the distance is odd), it calculates the range of possible positions for Alice's chip after `x` turns:
     - `l = max(1, d - x)` and `r = min(w, d + x)`.
     - It then checks if Alice can move to a position within this range that would allow her to win:
       - `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1`.
     - If both conditions are met, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

4. **Even Distance**:
   - If `abs(a - c) % 2 == 0` (i.e., the distance is even), it calculates the range of possible positions for Bob's chip after `x` turns:
     - `l = max(1, b - x)` and `r = min(w, b + x)`.
     - It then checks if Bob can move to a position within this range that would allow him to win:
       - `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x`.
     - If both conditions are met, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

### Correctness Verification:
1. **Initial Check**:
   - If `a > c`, the game will indeed end in a draw because Alice cannot move up and Bob cannot move down. This is correct.

2. **Odd Distance**:
   - The program correctly calculates the number of turns `x` and the range of possible positions for Alice's chip.
   - The conditions `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1` are used to determine if Alice can move to a position that would allow her to win. This is correct because Alice can move diagonally, which gives her an extra step.

3. **Even Distance**:
   - The program correctly calculates the number of turns `x` and the range of possible positions for Bob's chip.
   - The conditions `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x` are used to determine if Bob can move to a position that would allow him to win. This is correct because Bob moves in the same number of steps as Alice.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases and logic as described in the problem. It correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the initial positions and the rules of the game.

Correctness: **True**
