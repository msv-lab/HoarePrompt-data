Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the outcome of the game is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
6 5 2 2 5 3
```

Expected Output:
```
Alice
```

Actual Output:
```
Draw
```

In this case, Alice starts at (2, 2) and Bob starts at (5, 3). Alice can win by moving to (3, 3) on her first turn, and then Bob will move to (4, 3). Alice can then move to (5, 3) on her next turn, capturing Bob's chip. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" for this input. This indicates that the program's logic for determining the winner is not robust enough to handle all possible scenarios.
