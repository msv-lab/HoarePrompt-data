Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Variable Naming and Usage**: The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are used to represent the coordinates of Alice's and Bob's chips, but they are not consistently named or used. The problem description uses `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`, while the program uses `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. This can lead to confusion and potential errors.

2. **Logic for Determining the Outcome**: The logic for determining the outcome of the game is not entirely correct. The program attempts to calculate the range of possible positions for Alice and Bob, but it does not correctly handle the conditions for a win or a draw.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle edge cases where Alice or Bob cannot make a move. For example, if Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row, the game should end in a draw, but the program does not explicitly check for these conditions.

4. **Incorrect Calculation of Possible Moves**: The program calculates the range of possible moves for Alice and Bob using a formula that does not accurately reflect the game rules. Specifically, the logic for determining if Alice or Bob can move to a position that results in a win is flawed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # If Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row, it's a draw
        if x_a == h or x_b == 1:
            print("Draw")
            continue
        
        # Calculate the number of moves until they meet in the same row
        moves = (x_b - x_a) // 2
        
        # Check if they can meet in the same cell
        if (x_b - x_a) % 2 == 0 and abs(y_a - y_b) <= moves:
            print("Alice")
        elif (x_b - x_a) % 2 != 0 and abs(y_a - y_b) <= moves + 1:
            print("Bob")
        else:
            print("Draw")

func()
```

This corrected version:
- Uses consistent variable names (`x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`).
- Checks for the edge cases where Alice or Bob cannot make a move.
- Correctly calculates the number of moves until Alice and Bob can potentially meet in the same row.
- Determines the outcome based on whether they can meet in the same cell within the calculated number of moves.
