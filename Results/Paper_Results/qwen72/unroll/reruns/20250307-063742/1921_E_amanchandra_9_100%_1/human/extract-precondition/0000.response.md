Precondition: **The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. The input is structured as follows: the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `h` and `w` are the dimensions of the board (1 ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9), and `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w) with the guarantee that the initial positions do not coincide (either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b).**
