The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each involving a game board with dimensions `h` and `w`, and initial positions of two chips, Alice's chip at `(x_a, y_a)` and Bob's chip at `(x_b, y_b)`. For each test case, it reads the input values, performs a series of calculations based on the positions of the chips, and prints either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' depending on the conditions. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly outputs the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function consumes the input values and does not retain any state between iterations.
