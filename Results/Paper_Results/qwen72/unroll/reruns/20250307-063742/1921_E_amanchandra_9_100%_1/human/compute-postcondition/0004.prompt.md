You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. The input is structured as follows: the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `h` and `w` are the dimensions of the board (1 ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9), and `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w) with the guarantee that the initial positions do not coincide (either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if a > c:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2
            if abs(a - c) % 2:
                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= 
                    x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read six integers from the input and print either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the conditions in the loop. The values of `t`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will be consumed and not retained between iterations. After all iterations, the initial state of the variables outside the loop will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each with board dimensions `h` and `w`, and initial chip positions `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. It returns a result for each test case, but the specific output based on the input parameters is not provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
