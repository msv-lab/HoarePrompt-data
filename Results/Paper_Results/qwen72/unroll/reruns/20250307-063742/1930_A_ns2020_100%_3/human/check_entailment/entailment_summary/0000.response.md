### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum possible score by repeatedly selecting two integers from a list, adding the smaller of the two to the score, and then removing both integers. The process is repeated `n` times, where `2n` is the total number of integers on the whiteboard.

The given program works as follows:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of pairs) and a list of `2n` integers `A`.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - It sorts the list `A` in ascending order. Sorting is crucial because it ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together, which maximizes the score.

3. **Summing the Smaller Elements:**
   - It prints the sum of the elements at even indices in the sorted list. This is because, in a sorted list, the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are the smaller elements in each pair.

### Analysis:
- **Optimality:**
  - By sorting the list, the program ensures that the smallest elements are paired together. This is the optimal strategy because it maximizes the number of smaller elements that are added to the score.
  - For example, in the sorted list `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`, the pairs will be `(1, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, and `(3, 3)`, and the score will be `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The algorithm correctly identifies the smaller element in each pair by summing the elements at even indices.
  - This approach is mathematically sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.

- **Input and Output Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles the input format and processes each test case as described.
  - The output is the sum of the smaller elements in each pair, which is the maximum possible score.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy for solving the problem. It correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the maximum possible score.

### Correctness:
**True**
