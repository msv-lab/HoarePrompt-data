The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 5000`. It then enters a loop that runs `t` times. In each iteration of the loop, it reads another integer `n` from the input, where `1 <= n <= 50`, and a list of `2n` integers `A` from the input, where each integer in `A` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^7`. The function sorts the list `A` and prints the sum of the elements at even indices (i.e., the smaller elements in each pair of the sorted list). After `t` iterations, the function completes and the value of `t` is 0. The function does not return any value.
