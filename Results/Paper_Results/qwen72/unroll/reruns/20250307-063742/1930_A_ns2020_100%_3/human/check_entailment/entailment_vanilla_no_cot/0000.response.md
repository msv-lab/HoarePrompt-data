Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of 2n integers `A`.
3. **Sorting the List**: The list `A` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because to maximize the score, you should always pair the smallest numbers together.
4. **Summing the Minimum Values**: The program then sums every second element in the sorted list starting from the first element (`A[::2]`). This is correct because after sorting, the smallest elements will be at the even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), and these are the values that will be added to the score when you pair them with the next smallest elements.
5. **Output**: The sum is printed for each test case, which is the maximum possible score.

The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements, ensuring that the score is maximized by always choosing the smallest available pairs. Therefore, the program is correct.
