You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        A.sort()
        
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each execution, the sum of the smaller elements in each pair of the sorted list `A` has been printed. The value of `t` is now 0, and the values of `n` and `A` are not defined in the final state because they are re-assigned in each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 5000`. It then enters a loop that runs `t` times. In each iteration of the loop, it reads another integer `n` from the input, where `1 <= n <= 50`, and a list of `2n` integers `A` from the input, where each integer in `A` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^7`. The function sorts the list `A` and prints the sum of the elements at even indices (i.e., the smaller elements in each pair of the sorted list). After `t` iterations, the function completes and the value of `t` is 0. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to achieve the maximum score as described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it sorts the list of integers `A`. Sorting ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together, which is optimal for maximizing the score since we always add the minimum of the two chosen numbers.
3. **Summing Every Second Element**: After sorting, the program sums every second element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`). This approach correctly pairs the smallest numbers together, ensuring that the sum of the minimum values in each pair is maximized.
4. **Output**: The program prints the sum for each test case, which is the maximum score achievable.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description:
- It correctly processes the input for multiple test cases.
- It works for the smallest and largest possible values of `n` (1 to 50).
- It handles the case where all numbers are the same.
- It handles the case where the numbers are distinct.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program is correct for all potential cases.
