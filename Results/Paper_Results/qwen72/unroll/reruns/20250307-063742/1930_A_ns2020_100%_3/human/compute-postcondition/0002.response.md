Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each execution, the sum of the smaller elements in each pair of the sorted list `A` has been printed. The value of `t` is now 0, and the values of `n` and `A` are not defined in the final state because they are re-assigned in each iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the initial input integer.
- In each iteration, `n` is read from the input, and a list `A` of `2n` integers is also read from the input.
- The list `A` is sorted, and the sum of the elements at even indices (i.e., the smaller elements in each pair) is printed.
- After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.
- Once the loop finishes, `t` is 0, and the values of `n` and `A` are not retained because they are re-assigned in each iteration.
