The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^7. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these parameters and return a value based on the constraints and relationships between them.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 5000), `n` (an integer between 1 and 50), and `a` (a list of 2n integers, each between 1 and 10^7). It returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.**
