### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given 2n positive integers on a whiteboard.
   - We need to perform n moves, each time selecting two integers and adding the minimum of the two to our score.
   - The goal is to maximize the final score.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available integer with the next smallest available integer.
   - This ensures that we are adding the smallest possible values to our score, which is the optimal way to maximize the sum of the minimums.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - Sort the list of integers.
   - Sum the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2) because these will be the minimum values when paired with the next larger element.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of integers `A`.
   - It sorts the list `A`.
   - It prints the sum of the elements at even indices of the sorted list `A`.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly sorts the list of integers.
   - It correctly sums the elements at even indices, which are the minimum values in each pair.
   - The loop structure and input handling are appropriate for the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for the problem and handles the input and output as required. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
