### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally.
   - Alice's goal is to maximize the MEX, and Bob's goal is to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the array `arr`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Counter Usage:**
     - The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`. This is correct and efficient for keeping track of the elements.
   - **Loop Logic:**
     - The loop starts with `start = 0` and checks if the current `start` value exists in `nums`.
     - If `start` exists, it adds `start` to the set `vis` and decreases the count of `start` in `nums`.
     - The program then checks if `start + 1` exists in `nums`. If it does, it decreases the count of `start + 1` in `nums` and increments `start`.
     - If `start + 1` does not exist, the loop prints `start + 1` and returns. This is because `start + 1` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c`, which is the MEX.

4. **Optimal Play:**
   - The loop logic ensures that Alice and Bob are playing optimally:
     - Alice always tries to include the smallest possible integer in `c` by checking if `start` exists in `nums`.
     - Bob's actions are implicitly handled by the loop's condition checks. If `start + 1` is not available, Bob has effectively prevented Alice from including it.
   - The loop correctly handles the scenario where Bob might remove an integer that Alice needs to maximize the MEX.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:**
     - Input: `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
     - Steps:
       1. Alice picks 0, `c = [0]`, `arr = [0, 1, 1]`
       2. Bob picks 0, `c = [0]`, `arr = [1, 1]`
       3. Alice picks 1, `c = [0, 1]`, `arr = [1]`
       4. Bob picks 1, `c = [0, 1]`, `arr = []`
     - MEX of `c = [0, 1]` is 2.
   - **Example 2:**
     - Input: `arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
     - Steps:
       1. Alice picks 0, `c = [0]`, `arr = [1, 2, 3]`
       2. Bob picks 1, `c = [0]`, `arr = [2, 3]`
       3. Alice picks 2, `c = [0, 2]`, `arr = [3]`
       4. Bob picks 3, `c = [0, 2]`, `arr = []`
     - MEX of `c = [0, 2]` is 1.
   - **Example 3:**
     - Input: `arr = [1, 1]`
     - Steps:
       1. Alice picks 1, `c = [1]`, `arr = [1]`
       2. Bob picks 1, `c = [1]`, `arr = []`
     - MEX of `c = [1]` is 0.

6. **Annotated Code Validation:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The loop logic and the use of the `Counter` ensure that the program correctly identifies the MEX of `c` after both players play optimally.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob and correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

Final: **True**
