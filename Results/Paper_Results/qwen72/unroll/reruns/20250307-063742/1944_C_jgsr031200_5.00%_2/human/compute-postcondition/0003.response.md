The only variables in the loop head are `nums` and `start`. The loop condition `nums.get(start, 0)` checks if the frequency count of the integer `start` in the `nums` Counter object is greater than 0. If it is, the loop will execute.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list.
- `nums` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`.
- `start` is 0.
- `vis` is an empty set.

For the loop to execute the first time, `nums.get(start, 0)` must return a value greater than 0. Since `start` is 0, this means that the integer 0 must be present in the list `arr` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `nums.get(0, 0)` returns a value greater than 0. This can be achieved by ensuring that the integer 0 is present in the list `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `nums` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, and `nums[0]` must be greater than 0. `start` is 0. `vis` is an empty set.**
