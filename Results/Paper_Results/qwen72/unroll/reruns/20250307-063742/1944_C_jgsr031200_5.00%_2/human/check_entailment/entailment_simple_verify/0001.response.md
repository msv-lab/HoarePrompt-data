### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
   - It uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`. This is correct because it helps in determining how many times each integer appears.
   - It initializes `start` to 0 and a set `vis` to keep track of visited elements.

3. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop starts with `start = 0` and checks if `start` exists in `nums`.
   - If `start` exists, it adds `start` to the set `vis` and decreases the count of `start` in `nums`.
   - The program then checks if `start + 1` exists in `nums`. If it does, it decreases the count of `start + 1` in `nums` and increments `start`.
   - If `start + 1` does not exist, the loop prints `start + 1` and returns. This is because `start + 1` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c`, which is the MEX.

4. **Optimal Play:**
   - The logic in the loop ensures that Alice and Bob are playing optimally. Alice always tries to include the smallest possible integer, and Bob's actions are implicitly handled by the loop's condition checks.
   - The loop correctly handles the scenario where Bob might remove an integer that Alice needs to maximize the MEX.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the loop will print the smallest integer `x` such that `x` is not present in `arr` and then return.
   - The `vis` set will contain all integers from 0 up to `x-1` that were present in `arr`.
   - The `nums` Counter will be updated to reflect the decremented counts of these integers, and the count of `x-1` will be 0.
   - The `start` variable will be equal to `x-1` when the loop exits, and the program prints `start + 1`, which is the MEX.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the array `arr` is empty or contains only one element.
   - It also handles the case where all elements in `arr` are the same.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. It ensures that the MEX of `c` is calculated based on the optimal moves of both players. The annotated code supports the original assessment and confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Final: **True**
