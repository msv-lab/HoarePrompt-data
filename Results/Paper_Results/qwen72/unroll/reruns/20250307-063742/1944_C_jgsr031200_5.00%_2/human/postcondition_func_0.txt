The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers, where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. It prints the smallest integer `x` such that `x` is not present in `arr`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `vis` set will contain all integers from 0 up to `x-1` that were present in `arr`, and the `nums` Counter will be updated to reflect the decremented counts of these integers, with the count of `x-1` being 0. The `start` variable will be equal to `x-1` when the loop exits.
