### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
   - It uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`. This is correct because it helps in determining how many times each integer appears.
   - It initializes `start` to 0 and a set `vis` to keep track of visited elements.
   - It enters a loop where it checks if the current `start` value exists in `nums` (the counter).
   - If `start` exists, it adds `start` to the set `vis` and decreases the count of `start` in `nums`.
   - If `start + 1` also exists in `nums`, it decreases the count of `start + 1` in `nums` and increments `start`.
   - If `start + 1` does not exist in `nums`, it prints `start + 1` and returns.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, so she should try to include as many small integers as possible in `c`.
  - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`, so he should try to prevent Alice from including small integers in `c`.

- **Counter Usage:**
  - The `Counter` is used to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`. This is correct because it helps in determining how many times each integer appears.

- **Loop Logic:**
  - The loop starts with `start = 0` and checks if `start` exists in `nums`.
  - If `start` exists, Alice can append it to `c` and remove it from `arr`.
  - The program then checks if `start + 1` exists in `nums`. If it does, Alice can append it to `c` and remove it from `arr`, and `start` is incremented.
  - If `start + 1` does not exist, the loop prints `start + 1` and returns. This is because `start + 1` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c`, which is the MEX.

- **Optimal Play:**
  - The logic in the loop ensures that Alice and Bob are playing optimally. Alice always tries to include the smallest possible integer, and Bob's actions are implicitly handled by the loop's condition checks.
  - The loop correctly handles the scenario where Bob might remove an integer that Alice needs to maximize the MEX.

### Challenges to the Original Assessment:

- **Function `func_1` Implementation:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` by checking the smallest integer that is not present in `arr` and ensuring that both Alice and Bob play optimally.
  - The use of the `Counter` and the loop logic is sound and aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases well, such as when the array `arr` contains only one element or when all elements are the same.
  - The loop ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated even when there are multiple occurrences of the same integer.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. It ensures that the MEX of `c` is calculated based on the optimal moves of both players. The function `func_1` and the overall logic are accurate and handle the problem as described.

Final: **True**
