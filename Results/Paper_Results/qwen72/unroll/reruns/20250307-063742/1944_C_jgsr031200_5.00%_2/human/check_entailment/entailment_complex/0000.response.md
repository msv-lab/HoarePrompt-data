### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the resulting array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the array and the array `arr` itself.
   - The function `func_1` is called with `arr` as an argument.
   - Inside `func_1`:
     - A `Counter` object `nums` is created to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
     - A `set` `vis` is initialized to keep track of visited elements.
     - A variable `start` is initialized to 0.
     - The program enters a loop where it checks if the current `start` value is present in `nums`:
       - If `start` is present in `nums`, it is added to `vis`, and its count in `nums` is decremented.
       - If `start + 1` is also present in `nums`, its count is decremented, and `start` is incremented.
       - If `start + 1` is not present in `nums`, the program prints `start + 1` and returns.
     - If the loop exits without finding `start + 1` in `nums`, it prints `start`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning Alice will always try to pick the smallest available integer that can help maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to pick the smallest available integer that can help minimize the MEX.
   - The function `func_1` essentially simulates this optimal strategy by iterating through the integers starting from 0 and checking if they are present in the array. If both `start` and `start + 1` are present, Alice and Bob will pick them in their respective turns, and the loop continues. If `start + 1` is not present, the MEX is `start + 1`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been removed from `a`.
   - The use of the `Counter` object `nums` ensures that the counts of each integer are accurately tracked.
   - The loop correctly simulates the turns of Alice and Bob by decrementing the counts of the integers they pick.
   - The final output is the smallest integer `x` such that `x` is not present in `arr`, which is the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
