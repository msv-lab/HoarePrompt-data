Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the MEX of an array `c` after Alice and Bob play their game optimally. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. The key to solving this problem is understanding that Alice and Bob will always pick the smallest available number in the array `a` to influence the MEX of `c` in their favor.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each number in `arr`.
   - It initializes `start` to 0 and a set `vis` to keep track of the numbers that have been added to `c`.

3. **Loop to Determine MEX:**
   - The loop continues as long as the current `start` number is present in `arr` (i.e., `nums.get(start, 0)` is non-zero).
   - Alice and Bob will always pick the smallest available number to add to `c` or remove from `a`. This is simulated by decrementing the count of `start` in `nums` and adding `start` to `vis`.
   - If the next number (`start + 1`) is also present in `arr`, Alice will pick it, and the process continues.
   - If `start + 1` is not present, Bob will pick the current `start` number, and the loop will print `start + 1` as the MEX and return.

4. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - If the loop exits without finding a missing number, it prints `start`, which is the largest number in `arr` that was present.

### Correctness:

- **Optimal Play:**
  - The program correctly simulates the optimal play of Alice and Bob. Alice will always pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX, and Bob will always pick the next smallest number to minimize the MEX.
  - The use of the `Counter` and the `vis` set ensures that the program keeps track of the numbers that have been added to `c` and the numbers that are still available in `a`.

- **MEX Calculation:**
  - The MEX is calculated correctly by checking the smallest missing number in the sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the array `arr` contains all numbers from 0 to `n-1` or when it contains only a few numbers.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally.

Correctness: **True**
