Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to play the game. The function `func_1` is supposed to simulate the game and determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. However, the logic in the function does not accurately reflect the optimal play for both players.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Simulation of Bob's Turn**: The function does not simulate Bob's turn correctly. According to the problem description, Bob should also pick an element from the array `a` and delete it, but the function only simulates Alice's turn and does not account for Bob's actions.

2. **MEX Calculation**: The function calculates the MEX by decrementing the count of elements in the `nums` counter and checking if the next element is available. This approach does not ensure that the MEX is calculated correctly after both players have played optimally.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
- **Expected Output**: 1
- **Actual Output**: 4

In this case, the optimal play would be:
1. Alice picks 0, `a = [1, 2, 3]`, `c = [0]`.
2. Bob picks 1, `a = [2, 3]`, `c = [0]`.
3. Alice picks 2, `a = [3]`, `c = [0, 2]`.
4. Bob picks 3, `a = []`, `c = [0, 2]`.

The MEX of `c = [0, 2]` is 1, but the program outputs 4, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement, and it fails to handle the optimal play for both Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
