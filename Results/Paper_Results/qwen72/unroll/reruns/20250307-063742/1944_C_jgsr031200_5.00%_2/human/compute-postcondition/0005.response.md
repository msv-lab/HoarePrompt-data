To determine what will be printed by the `print(start)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the behavior of the loop:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - The loop will print the smallest integer `x` such that `x` is not present in `arr`.
   - The `vis` set will contain all integers from 0 up to `x-1` that were present in `arr`.
   - The `nums` Counter will be updated to reflect the decremented counts of these integers, and the count of `x-1` will be 0.
   - The `start` variable will be equal to `x-1` when the loop exits.

2. **Behavior of the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates through integers starting from 0 and checks if each integer is present in `arr`.
   - The first integer `x` that is not present in `arr` is printed.
   - The `vis` set is updated to include all integers from 0 to `x-1` that were present in `arr`.
   - The `nums` Counter is updated to decrement the counts of these integers, and the count of `x-1` is set to 0.
   - The `start` variable is set to `x-1` when the loop exits.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - When the loop exits, `start` is set to `x-1`, where `x` is the smallest integer not present in `arr`.
   - Therefore, `start` will be the largest integer in `arr` that is present, or the largest integer less than `x`.

Given this information, the `print(start)` statement will output the value of `start`, which is the largest integer in `arr` that is present, or the largest integer less than the smallest integer not present in `arr`.

Output: **start (where start is the largest integer in `arr` that is present, or the largest integer less than the smallest integer not present in `arr`)**
