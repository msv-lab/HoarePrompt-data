Output State: **The loop will print the smallest integer `x` such that `x` is not present in `arr` and then return. The `vis` set will contain all integers from 0 up to `x-1` that were present in `arr`. The `nums` Counter will be updated to reflect the decremented counts of these integers, and the count of `x-1` will be 0. The `start` variable will be equal to `x-1` when the loop exits.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` is non-zero, meaning `start` is an integer present in `arr`.
- In each iteration, `start` is added to the `vis` set, and the count of `start` in `nums` is decremented.
- If `start + 1` is also present in `arr`, its count is decremented, and `start` is incremented.
- If `start + 1` is not present in `arr`, the loop prints `start + 1` and returns.
- The loop will eventually find the smallest integer `x` that is not in `arr`, print `x`, and return.
- The `vis` set will contain all integers from 0 up to `x-1` that were present in `arr`.
- The `nums` Counter will have the counts of these integers decremented, and the count of `x-1` will be 0.
- The `start` variable will be equal to `x-1` when the loop exits.
