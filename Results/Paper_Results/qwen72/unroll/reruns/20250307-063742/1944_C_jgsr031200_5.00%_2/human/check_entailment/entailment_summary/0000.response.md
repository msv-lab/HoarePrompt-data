Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the game between Alice and Bob where the goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` after all elements of `a` have been removed, with Alice trying to maximize the MEX and Bob trying to minimize it. The function `func_1` is the core logic that processes each test case.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Counter Initialization**: The `nums` Counter is initialized to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - **MEX Calculation**: The `start` variable is used to track the current MEX candidate. The loop continues as long as `start` is present in `nums` (i.e., `nums[start] > 0`).
   - **Alice's Move**: Alice will always pick the smallest available integer that is not already in `c` (or has been picked before and is still in `nums`). This is done by decrementing the count of `start` in `nums`.
   - **Bob's Move**: Bob will try to minimize the MEX by picking the next smallest integer if it is available. This is done by checking if `start + 1` is in `nums` and decrementing its count if it is. If `start + 1` is not available, the loop exits, and the MEX is `start + 1`.

3. **Output**: The function prints the MEX value for each test case, which is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array `c` after all elements of `a` have been removed.

4. **Optimal Play**: The logic in `func_1` ensures that both players play optimally:
   - Alice always picks the smallest available integer to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob always picks the next smallest integer to minimize the MEX, if possible.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `arr` contains only one element, the function correctly prints `0` because the MEX of a single-element array is always `0`.
   - If `arr` contains multiple elements, the function correctly handles the scenario where Alice and Bob take turns, and the MEX is calculated based on the optimal moves.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

Correctness: **True**
