### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Processing (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes it correctly.
   - It correctly splits the input into individual elements and parses them as integers.
   - It correctly handles the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by extracting `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` from the input.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results, which is the expected behavior.

2. **Score Calculation (`calculate_score`)**:
   - The function correctly initializes the score and current position.
   - It iterates through the permutation for up to `k` steps, updating the score and current position.
   - It correctly detects cycles and calculates the score for full cycles and any remaining steps.
   - The function returns the correct score for the given starting position and number of steps.

3. **Game Result Determination (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha using `calculate_score`.
   - It compares the scores and returns the appropriate result: 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, and 'Draw' if the scores are equal.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic for the "Permutation game" problem. It handles input, processes test cases, calculates scores, and determines the game results as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
