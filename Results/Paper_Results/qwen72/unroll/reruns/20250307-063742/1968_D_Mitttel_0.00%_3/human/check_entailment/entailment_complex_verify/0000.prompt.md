You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

Each test case consists of integers `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, and two lists of integers `p` and `a`, each of length `n`. It processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the provided parameters and collects the results. After processing all test cases, it prints each result to the console. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it is considered correct:

1. **Input Handling (func_2)**:
   - The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to extract the necessary values for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the input format and iterates over each test case.

2. **Score Calculation (calculate_score)**:
   - The function `calculate_score` correctly simulates the game for a given starting position.
   - It keeps track of the score and the current position, and it uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles.
   - When a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by leveraging the cycle length and score, which is an efficient way to handle large values of `k`.

3. **Game Result Determination (func_1)**:
   - The function `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha to determine their final scores.
   - It compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

The program handles all edge cases, including cycles and large values of `k`, and it correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
