The function `calculate_score` accepts a positive integer `start_pos` and returns the sum of the values in the array `a` starting from the position `start_pos` and moving through the permutation `p` for a total of `k` steps. If a cycle is detected during the traversal, the function adjusts the score to account for the full cycles and any remaining steps. If no cycle is detected, the function simply returns the sum of the values over the `k` steps.
