### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` reads the input and processes multiple test cases. It correctly parses the input and initializes the variables `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` for each test case.
   - The input is read using `sys.stdin.read` and split into a list of strings, which is then used to extract the necessary values for each test case.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - `calculate_score` is responsible for calculating the score for a given starting position. It correctly handles the following:
     - **Initial Score and Position**: Initializes the score to 0 and the current position to the starting position.
     - **Cycle Detection**: Uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles in the permutation. If a cycle is detected, it calculates the length of the cycle and the score gained within one cycle.
     - **Cycle Handling**: If a cycle is detected, it calculates the number of full cycles that can be completed within the remaining steps and updates the score accordingly. It then handles the remaining steps after the full cycles.
     - **No Cycle**: If no cycle is detected, it simply continues to the end of the `k` steps.

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - `func_1` compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and returns the appropriate result (`Bodya`, `Sasha`, or `Draw`).
   - The results are collected in a list and printed at the end of `func_2`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as:
     - When `k` is 1.
     - When the starting positions are the same.
     - When the permutation is a single element.
     - When the permutation has cycles.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient in handling large inputs (up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) elements in the permutation and array, and up to \(10^9\) turns) by detecting cycles and using cycle properties to avoid unnecessary iterations.

### Correctness:
Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" and handle all edge cases and large inputs efficiently.

**Correctness: **True****
