The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. It calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha based on the positions `PB` and `PS` in the permutation `p` and the values in the list `a`. The function returns 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is greater than Sasha's score, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is greater than Bodya's score, and 'Draw' if both scores are equal.
