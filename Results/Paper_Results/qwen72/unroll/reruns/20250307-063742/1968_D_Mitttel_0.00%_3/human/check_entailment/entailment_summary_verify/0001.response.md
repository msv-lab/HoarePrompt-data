### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in a permutation and an array.
   - Each player can either stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation.
   - The game lasts for `k` turns, and the player with the higher score after `k` turns wins.
   - The score is calculated by summing the values in the array `a` at the positions visited by the player.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the length of the permutation `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (`PB` and `PS`), the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.
   - The function is logically correct as it follows the problem's requirements.

3. **Function 2: `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to track the positions visited and the step at which they were visited.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the player visits a position they have already visited), the function calculates the score for the remaining steps by considering the cycle length and the score accumulated within the cycle.
   - The function correctly handles the cycle detection and the calculation of the score for the remaining steps.
   - The function is logically correct and follows the problem's requirements.

4. **Function 3: `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The function collects the results and prints them at the end.
   - The function is logically correct and follows the problem's requirements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the game lasts for a large number of turns (`k` up to \(10^9\)) by efficiently detecting cycles and calculating the score for the remaining steps.
   - The program also handles the case where the players start at the same position and the permutation and array are large (up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\)).
   - The program correctly handles the case where the permutation and array are small (e.g., `n = 1`).

6. **Input and Output**:
   - The input is read correctly and parsed into the necessary variables.
   - The output is generated correctly for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Cycle Detection**:
  - The `calculate_score` function uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles. This is an efficient approach to avoid unnecessary repeated calculations.
  - When a cycle is detected, the function calculates the score for the remaining steps by leveraging the cycle length and the score accumulated within the cycle. This ensures that the function can handle large values of `k` efficiently.

- **Score Calculation**:
  - The function correctly accumulates the score for each player by summing the values in the array `a` at the positions visited.
  - The function handles the case where the player stays at the same position by not moving to `p_x` if it is the same as `x`.

- **Test Case Handling**:
  - The `func_2` function reads multiple test cases and processes each one independently.
  - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
  - The results are collected and printed at the end, ensuring that the output format matches the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the game mechanics, including cycle detection and score calculation, and processes multiple test cases efficiently. There are no logical errors or edge cases that are not handled properly.

Final: **True**
