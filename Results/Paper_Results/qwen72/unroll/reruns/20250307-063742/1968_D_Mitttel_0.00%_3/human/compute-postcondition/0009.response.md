The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`. For the loop to execute, `results` must be a non-empty list. The state of `index` and `t` do not affect the execution of the loop, as they are not part of the loop head. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `results` to ensure it contains at least one element. The state of `result` will be the first element of `results` at the start of the loop.

State: **`index` is 2 + 4 * t + 2 * n * t, `t` is the initial value of `data[0]`, `func_2()` is set up to read input from `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing at least one element, `result` is the first element in `results`**
