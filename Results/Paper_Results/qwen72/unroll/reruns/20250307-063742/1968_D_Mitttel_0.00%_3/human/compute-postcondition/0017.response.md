The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `remainder_steps`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `remainder_steps`. If `remainder_steps` is at least 1, the loop will execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `score` is `score + full_cycles * cycle_score`
- `steps` remains unchanged
- `current_pos` remains unchanged
- `cycle_start` remains unchanged
- `cycle_length` remains unchanged
- `cycle_score` is the sum of the values in `a` over the cycle
- `cycle_pos` is the position after the cycle completes
- `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`
- `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`
- `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`

To ensure the loop executes, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`score` is `score + full_cycles * cycle_score`, `steps` remains unchanged, `current_pos` remains unchanged, `cycle_start` remains unchanged, `cycle_length` remains unchanged, `cycle_score` is the sum of the values in `a` over the cycle, `cycle_pos` is the position after the cycle completes, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0**
