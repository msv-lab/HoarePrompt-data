Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from `sys.stdin`. Each test case consists of integers `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, and two lists of integers `p` and `a`, each of length `n`. It processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the provided parameters and collects the results. After processing all test cases, it prints each result to the console. The function does not return any value. **
