Postcondition: ***`score` is the sum of the values in `a` from the initial position over `k` steps or up to the point where a cycle is detected. `steps` is the number of steps taken (either `k` or the number of steps before a cycle was detected). `current_pos` is the position after `k` steps or the position where the cycle was detected. If a cycle is detected (`cycle_start` is not -1), `score` is updated to `score + full_cycles * cycle_score + sum(a[current_pos - 1] for _ in range(remainder_steps))`, `steps` remains unchanged, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]` after `remainder_steps` iterations, `cycle_start`, `cycle_length`, `cycle_score`, and `cycle_pos` remain unchanged, and `remaining_steps` is `0`. If no cycle is detected (`cycle_start` is -1), the variables remain unchanged.***
