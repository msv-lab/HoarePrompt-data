Output State: **`score` remains unchanged, `steps` remains unchanged, `current_pos` remains unchanged, `cycle_start` remains unchanged, `cycle_length` remains unchanged, `cycle_score` is the sum of the values in `a` over the cycle, `cycle_pos` is the position after the cycle completes, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`.** 

The code snippet calculates the difference between `k` and `steps` and assigns this value to `remaining_steps`. The other variables (`score`, `steps`, `current_pos`, `cycle_start`, `cycle_length`, `cycle_score`, and `cycle_pos`) remain unchanged.
