Output State: **`score` is `score + full_cycles * cycle_score + sum(a[current_pos - 1] for _ in range(remainder_steps))`, `steps` remains unchanged, `current_pos` is `p[current_pos - 1]` after `remainder_steps` iterations, `cycle_start` remains unchanged, `cycle_length` remains unchanged, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `remaining_steps` is `0`.**
