Output State: **`score` is `score + full_cycles * cycle_score`, `steps` remains unchanged, `current_pos` remains unchanged, `cycle_start` remains unchanged, `cycle_length` remains unchanged, `cycle_score` is the sum of the values in `a` over the cycle, `cycle_pos` is the position after the cycle completes, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`.**

The value of `score` is updated by adding the product of `full_cycles` and `cycle_score` to the original `score`. All other variables remain unchanged.
