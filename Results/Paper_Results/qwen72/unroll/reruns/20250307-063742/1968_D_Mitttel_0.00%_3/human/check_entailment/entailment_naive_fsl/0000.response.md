Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it is considered correct:

1. **Input Handling (func_2)**:
   - The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to extract the necessary values for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the input format and iterates over each test case.

2. **Score Calculation (calculate_score)**:
   - The function `calculate_score` correctly simulates the game for a given starting position.
   - It keeps track of the score and the current position, and it uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles.
   - When a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by leveraging the cycle length and score, which is an efficient way to handle large values of `k`.

3. **Game Result Determination (func_1)**:
   - The function `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha to determine their final scores.
   - It compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

The program handles all edge cases, including cycles and large values of `k`, and it correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
