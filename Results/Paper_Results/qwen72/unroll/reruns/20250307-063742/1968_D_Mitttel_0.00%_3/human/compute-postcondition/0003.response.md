Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `func_2()` is set up to read input from `sys.stdin`, and `data` is a list of strings.** 

The value of `index` has been incremented from 0 to 1, and `t` is now the integer value of the first element in the `data` list. The function `func_2()` and the `data` list remain unchanged.
