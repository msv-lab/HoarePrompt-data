Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (func_2)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to extract the necessary values for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the input format and iterates over each test case.
   - The function correctly updates the index to point to the next set of values for each test case.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results to the console.

2. **Score Calculation (calculate_score)**:
   - The function `calculate_score` correctly simulates the game for a given starting position.
   - It initializes the score to 0 and the current position to the starting position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to keep track of positions and the step at which they were visited, which helps in detecting cycles.
   - When a cycle is detected, it calculates the cycle length and the total score for one complete cycle.
   - It then calculates the number of full cycles that can be completed within the remaining steps and adds the corresponding score.
   - Finally, it adds the score for the remaining steps after the full cycles.

3. **Game Result Determination (func_1)**:
   - The function `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha to determine their final scores.
   - It compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").
   - The comparison logic is straightforward and correct.

4. **Cycle Detection and Handling**:
   - The cycle detection logic in `calculate_score` is crucial for handling large values of `k` efficiently.
   - The function correctly identifies when a cycle is detected and calculates the score for the remaining steps using the cycle length and score.
   - This ensures that the function can handle very large values of `k` without running into performance issues.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when the starting positions are the same, when the permutation is a single element, and when the game duration `k` is very large.
   - The cycle detection and handling logic ensures that the program can handle any permutation and any value of `k` within the given constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases and large inputs efficiently.

Final: **True**
