### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in a permutation and an array.
   - Each player can either stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation.
   - The game lasts for `k` turns, and the player with the higher score after `k` turns wins.
   - The score is calculated by summing the values in the array `a` at the positions visited by the player.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the length of the permutation `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (`PB` and `PS`), the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.
   - The function is logically correct as it follows the problem's requirements.

3. **Function 2: `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to track the positions visited and the step at which they were visited.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the player visits a position they have already visited), the function calculates the score for the remaining steps by considering the cycle length and the score accumulated within the cycle.
   - The function correctly handles the cycle detection and the calculation of the score for the remaining steps.
   - The function is logically correct and follows the problem's requirements.

4. **Function 3: `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The function collects the results and prints them at the end.
   - The function is logically correct and follows the problem's requirements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the game lasts for a large number of turns (`k` up to \(10^9\)) by efficiently detecting cycles and calculating the score for the remaining steps.
   - The program also handles the case where the players start at the same position and the permutation and array are large (up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\)).
   - The program correctly handles the case where no cycle is detected, and the player simply follows the permutation for `k` steps.

6. **Input and Output**:
   - The input is read correctly and parsed into the necessary variables.
   - The output is generated correctly for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis of Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**:
  - The program starts by calling `func_2()`, which reads the input and processes multiple test cases.

- **Function 1: `func_1`**:
  - The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
  - It calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function.
  - The scores are compared, and the appropriate result is returned.
  - The annotations confirm that the function correctly calculates the scores and returns the correct result based on the comparison.

- **Function 2: `calculate_score`**:
  - The function `calculate_score` is called with the starting position `start_pos`.
  - It initializes `score`, `current_pos`, `steps`, `visited`, and `cycle_start`.
  - The function enters a loop that runs until `steps` reaches `k` or a cycle is detected.
  - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the cycle length and cycle score, then updates the score for the remaining steps.
  - The annotations confirm that the function correctly handles cycle detection and score calculation for the remaining steps.

- **Function 3: `func_2`**:
  - The function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
  - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - The results are collected and printed at the end.
  - The annotations confirm that the function correctly reads and processes the input, and it correctly calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the game mechanics, including cycle detection and score calculation, and it efficiently handles large inputs and multiple test cases. The annotations confirm that the program's state and behavior are as expected at key points in the code.

Final: **True**
