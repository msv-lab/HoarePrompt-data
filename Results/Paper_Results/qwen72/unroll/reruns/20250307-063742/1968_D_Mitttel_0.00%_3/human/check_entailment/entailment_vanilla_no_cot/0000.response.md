Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic for the "Permutation game" as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function.
   - It compares the scores and returns the appropriate result: "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if both scores are equal.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position `start_pos`.
   - It initializes the score to 0 and the current position to `start_pos`.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to keep track of the positions visited and the step at which they were visited.
   - It iterates up to `k` steps, adding the score from the current position and moving to the next position according to the permutation `p`.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the current position is already in `visited`), it calculates the cycle length and the total score for one cycle.
   - It then adds the score for the remaining steps, considering full cycles and the remainder of the steps after the full cycles.
   - Finally, it returns the total score.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It initializes the index and reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` to determine the winner for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

The program handles the input and output correctly, and the logic for calculating the scores and determining the winner is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
