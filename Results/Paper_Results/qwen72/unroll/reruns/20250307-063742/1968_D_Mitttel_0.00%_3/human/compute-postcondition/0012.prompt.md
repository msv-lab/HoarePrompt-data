You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2()`. The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves integers `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS` and two lists of integers `p` and `a` of length `n`.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        
        PB = int(data[index + 2])
        
        PS = int(data[index + 3])
        
        index += 4
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `index` is 2 + 4 * t + 2 * n * t, `t` is the initial value of `data[0]`, `func_2()` is set up to read input from `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration of the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The `index` remains 2 + 4 * t + 2 * n * t, `t` remains the initial value of `data[0]`, `func_2()` remains set up to read input from `sys.stdin`, `data` remains a list of strings, and `results` remains a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration of the loop. The loop has printed each element of `results` to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads multiple test cases from `sys.stdin`, each containing integers `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, and two lists of integers `p` and `a` of length `n`. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
