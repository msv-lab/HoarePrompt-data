Output State: **The `index` remains 2 + 4 * t + 2 * n * t, `t` remains the initial value of `data[0]`, `func_2()` remains set up to read input from `sys.stdin`, `data` remains a list of strings, and `results` remains a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration of the loop. The loop has printed each element of `results` to the console.**
