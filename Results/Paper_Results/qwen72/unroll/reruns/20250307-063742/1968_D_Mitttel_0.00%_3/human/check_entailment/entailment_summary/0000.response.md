Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for determining the winner of the game by comparing the scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It calls `calculate_score` for both starting positions `PB` and `PS` to get the final scores.
   - It correctly returns 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is greater, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is greater, and 'Draw' if both scores are equal.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position `start_pos` over `k` turns.
   - It initializes the score to 0 and the current position to `start_pos`.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to track the steps at which each position is visited to detect cycles.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the length and score of the cycle and adjusts the total score to account for full cycles and any remaining steps.
   - If no cycle is detected, it simply sums the values in `a` for the `k` steps.
   - The function correctly handles the cycle detection and score calculation, ensuring that the score is computed accurately even in the presence of cycles.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input data and extracts the necessary parameters for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - It prints the results for each test case after processing all of them.
   - The function handles the input and output as required by the problem statement.

Given that all functions are implemented correctly and handle the problem requirements, the program should work as intended for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
