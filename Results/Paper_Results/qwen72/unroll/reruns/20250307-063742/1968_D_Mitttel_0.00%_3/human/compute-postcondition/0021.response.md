The function `calculate_score` accepts a parameter `start_pos`. `start_pos` is a positive integer such that 1 <= start_pos <= n, where n is the length of the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

If a cycle is detected during the traversal of the array `a` starting from `start_pos` over `k` steps, the function returns the value of `score` updated as `score + full_cycles * cycle_score + sum(a[current_pos - 1] for _ in range(remainder_steps))`. If no cycle is detected, the function returns the value of `score`, which is the sum of the values in `a` over the `k` steps.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `start_pos` and returns the sum of the values in `a` from the initial position over `k` steps. If a cycle is detected, it returns the sum adjusted by the number of full cycles and the remaining steps. If no cycle is detected, it returns the sum of the values over the `k` steps.**
