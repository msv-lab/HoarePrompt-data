Output State: **The function `func_2()` is now set up to read input from `sys.stdin`. No variables are passed to the function, and it will process multiple test cases. Each test case involves integers `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS` and two lists of integers `p` and `a` of length `n`. The initial state remains unchanged, and the function is ready to execute.**
