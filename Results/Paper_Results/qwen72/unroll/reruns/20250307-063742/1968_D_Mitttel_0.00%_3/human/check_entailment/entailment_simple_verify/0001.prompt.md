You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in a permutation and an array.
   - Each player can either stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation.
   - The game lasts for `k` turns, and the player with the higher score after `k` turns wins.
   - The score is calculated by summing the values in the array `a` at the positions visited by the player.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the length of the permutation `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (`PB` and `PS`), the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.
   - The function is logically correct as it follows the problem's requirements.

3. **Function 2: `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to track the positions visited and the step at which they were visited.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the player visits a position they have already visited), the function calculates the score for the remaining steps by considering the cycle length and the score accumulated within the cycle.
   - The function correctly handles the cycle detection and the calculation of the score for the remaining steps.
   - The function is logically correct and follows the problem's requirements.

4. **Function 3: `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The function collects the results and prints them at the end.
   - The function is logically correct and follows the problem's requirements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the game lasts for a large number of turns (`k` up to \(10^9\)) by efficiently detecting cycles and calculating the score for the remaining steps.
   - The program also handles the case where the players start at the same position and the permutation and array are large (up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\)).

6. **Input and Output**:
   - The input is read correctly and parsed into the necessary variables.
   - The output is generated correctly for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program is logically correct and follows the problem's requirements. It efficiently handles the game mechanics, including cycle detection and score calculation, and correctly processes multiple test cases.

Correctness: **True**
