### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in a permutation and an array.
   - Each player can either stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation.
   - The game lasts for `k` turns, and the player with the higher score after `k` turns wins.
   - The score is calculated by summing the values in the array `a` at the positions visited by the player.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the length of the permutation `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (`PB` and `PS`), the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.
   - The function is logically correct as it follows the problem's requirements.

3. **Function 2: `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to track the positions visited and the step at which they were visited.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the player visits a position they have already visited), the function calculates the score for the remaining steps by considering the cycle length and the score accumulated within the cycle.
   - The function correctly handles the cycle detection and the calculation of the score for the remaining steps.
   - The function is logically correct and follows the problem's requirements.

4. **Function 3: `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The function collects the results and prints them at the end.
   - The function is logically correct and follows the problem's requirements.

5. **Cycle Detection and Score Calculation**:
   - The `calculate_score` function efficiently detects cycles and calculates the score for the remaining steps by using the cycle length and cycle score.
   - This is crucial for handling large values of `k` (up to \(10^9\)) without running into performance issues.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the game lasts for a large number of turns (`k` up to \(10^9\)) by efficiently detecting cycles and calculating the score for the remaining steps.
   - The program also handles the case where the players start at the same position and the permutation and array are large (up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\)).
   - The program correctly handles the case where the permutation is a single element (i.e., `n = 1`).

7. **Input and Output**:
   - The input is read correctly and parsed into the necessary variables.
   - The output is generated correctly for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
The given program is logically correct and follows the problem's requirements. It efficiently handles the game mechanics, including cycle detection and score calculation, and correctly processes multiple test cases.

Final: **True**
