Output State: **`score` remains unchanged, `steps` remains unchanged, `current_pos` remains unchanged, `cycle_start` remains unchanged, `cycle_length` remains unchanged, `cycle_score` is the sum of the values in `a` over the cycle, `cycle_pos` is the position after the cycle completes, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`.**

The code snippet calculates the value of `remainder_steps` as the remainder when `remaining_steps` is divided by `cycle_length`. All other variables remain unchanged.
