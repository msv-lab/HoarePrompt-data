It seems there is a mismatch between the problem description and the annotated program. The provided Python program `generate_files_for_html_in_range` is designed to generate Python files for HTML files in subfolders whose names fall within a specified range. However, the annotated program `func` is a completely different program that appears to be solving a different problem, likely related to string manipulation and input validation.

Given the context, I will evaluate the correctness of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function based on the problem description and the comments provided.

### Problem Description:
- The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` should:
  - Get the current directory.
  - List all subfolders in the current directory.
  - For each subfolder, check if its name is a digit and falls within the specified range `[start, end]`.
  - If the subfolder name is within the range, list all `.html` files in that subfolder.
  - For each `.html` file, create two new files: one with `-ac.py` appended to the base name and another with `-wa.py` appended to the base name.
  - Print the number of HTML files in each subfolder and the names of the generated files.

### Annotated Program:
```python
import os

def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):
    # 获取当前目录下的所有子文件夹
    current_dir = os.getcwd()
    subfolders = [f.path for f in os.scandir(current_dir) if f.is_dir()]
    
    for folder in subfolders:
        # 检查文件夹名称是否在指定范围内
        folder_name = os.path.basename(folder)
        if folder_name.isdigit() and start <= int(folder_name) <= end:
            # 获取子文件夹中的所有.html文件
            html_files = [f for f in os.listdir(folder) if f.endswith('.html')]
            print(f"Folder '{folder}' contains {len(html_files)} HTML files.")
            
            # 为每个.html文件生成对应的文件
            for html_file in html_files:
                base_name = os.path.splitext(html_file)[0]
                ac_file = os.path.join(folder, f"{base_name}-ac.py")
                wa_file = os.path.join(folder, f"{base_name}-wa.py")
                
                # 创建文件
                open(ac_file, 'w').close()
                open(wa_file, 'w').close()
                print(f"Generated files: {ac_file}, {wa_file}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # 指定目录范围
    start_range = 1951
    end_range = 1980
    generate_files_for_html_in_range(start_range, end_range)
```

### Reasoning:
1. **Current Directory and Subfolders:**
   - The program correctly gets the current directory using `os.getcwd()`.
   - It lists all subfolders in the current directory using a list comprehension with `os.scandir()` and `f.is_dir()`.

2. **Subfolder Name Check:**
   - The program checks if the subfolder name is a digit and falls within the specified range `[start, end]` using `folder_name.isdigit()` and `start <= int(folder_name) <= end`.

3. **HTML Files in Subfolders:**
   - The program lists all `.html` files in the subfolder using a list comprehension with `f.endswith('.html')`.

4. **File Generation:**
   - The program generates two new files for each `.html` file: one with `-ac.py` and another with `-wa.py`.
   - It uses `os.path.splitext()` to get the base name of the `.html` file and `os.path.join()` to construct the full path for the new files.
   - The files are created using `open(file, 'w').close()`, which is a correct way to create empty files.

5. **Main Execution:**
   - The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block correctly specifies the range and calls the function.

### Conclusion:
The program `generate_files_for_html_in_range` appears to correctly implement the described functionality. There are no obvious logical or syntactical errors in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
