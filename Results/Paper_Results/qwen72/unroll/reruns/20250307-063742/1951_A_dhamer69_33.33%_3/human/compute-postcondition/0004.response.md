Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `s` from the user input. The function checks if the string `s` meets certain conditions based on the value of `n` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` is set to 0. **
