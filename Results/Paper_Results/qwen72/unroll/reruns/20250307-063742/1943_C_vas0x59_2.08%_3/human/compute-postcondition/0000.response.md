Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3, and the edges are pairs of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v, representing the vertices connected by an edge.** 

The value of `n` has been assigned from the input, and it is now an integer within the range 1 to 2000. The information about the edges remains unchanged and is still valid.
