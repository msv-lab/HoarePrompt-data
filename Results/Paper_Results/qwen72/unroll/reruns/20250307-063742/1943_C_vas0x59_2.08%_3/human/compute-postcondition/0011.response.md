Output State: **The `path_ba` list contains the indices of the vertices in the shortest path from vertex `b` to vertex `0`, in reverse order (from `b` to `0`). The `previous` list remains unchanged. The `d` list remains unchanged. The `_` variable remains unchanged. The `a` and `b` variables remain unchanged. The `ops` list is now an empty list.**

The `ops` list has been initialized to an empty list, while all other variables and their values remain unchanged.
