Output State: The `ops` list now contains tuples where the first element is the middle element `c` of the `path_ba` list, and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` (inclusive). The length of the `ops` list is `ci + 1`. The `path_ba`, `previous`, `d`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `ci`, and `c` variables remain unchanged.
