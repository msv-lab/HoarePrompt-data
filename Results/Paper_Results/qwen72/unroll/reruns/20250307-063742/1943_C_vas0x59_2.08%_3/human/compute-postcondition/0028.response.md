The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters in its function signature. It reads input values for `n` and the edges of the tree directly from `stdin`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3, and the edges are pairs of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v, representing the vertices connected by an edge. The function returns `None`.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a list of edges from standard input, where `n` is the number of vertices in a tree and each edge is a pair of integers representing connected vertices. The function does not return any value.**
