Output State: **The `path_ba` list contains the indices of the vertices in the shortest path from vertex `b` to vertex `0`, in reverse order (from `b` to `0`). The `previous` list remains unchanged. The `d` list remains unchanged. The `_` variable remains unchanged. The `a` and `b` variables remain unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as the last element in `path_ba` has a valid predecessor in the `previous` list (i.e., `previous[path_ba[-1]]` is not `-1`).
- In each iteration, the loop appends the predecessor of the last vertex in `path_ba` to the `path_ba` list.
- When the loop reaches a vertex with no predecessor (i.e., the vertex `0`), it breaks.
- As a result, `path_ba` will contain the indices of the vertices in the shortest path from vertex `b` to vertex `0`, starting from `b` and ending at `0`, in reverse order.
- The other variables (`previous`, `d`, `_`, `a`, and `b`) are not modified by the loop, so they remain in their initial state.
