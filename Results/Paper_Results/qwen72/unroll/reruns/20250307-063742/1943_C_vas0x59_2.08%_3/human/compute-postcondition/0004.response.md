Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices (0-based) of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex by an edge. The length of each list in `u2vs` will be the degree of the corresponding vertex. `d` is a list of distances from vertex 0 to all other vertices, and `_` is a variable that has been assigned a value, but it is not used.**
