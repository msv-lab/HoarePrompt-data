No variables are passed in the function signature. The function reads input values for n and the edges of the tree directly from stdin. n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3, and the edges are pairs of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v, representing the vertices connected by an edge.
