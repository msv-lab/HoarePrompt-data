To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `i`: This is the loop index.
   - `len(path_ba)`: This is the length of the `path_ba` list.
   - `c1`: This is a variable that is derived from `c2`, which is half the length of `path_ba`.

2. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if the range function generates at least one value for `i`.
   - The range function `range(start, stop, step)` generates values starting from `start` up to, but not including, `stop`, with a step size of `step`.

3. **Range Function Analysis:**
   - `start` is 1.
   - `stop` is `len(path_ba) - c1`.
   - `step` is 2.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes:**
   - For the loop to execute, `stop` must be greater than `start`.
   - Therefore, `len(path_ba) - c1` must be greater than 1.
   - Given that `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, we can express `c1` as `c2 - 1`.
   - Substituting `c1` in the condition, we get: `len(path_ba) - (c2 - 1) > 1`.
   - Simplifying, we get: `len(path_ba) - c2 + 1 > 1`.
   - Further simplifying, we get: `len(path_ba) - c2 > 0`.
   - Since `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, we can substitute `c2` with `len(path_ba) / 2`.
   - Therefore, `len(path_ba) - len(path_ba) / 2 > 0`.
   - Simplifying, we get: `len(path_ba) / 2 > 0`.
   - This implies that `len(path_ba)` must be greater than 0 and even.

5. **Initial State Adjustments:**
   - The length of `path_ba` must be greater than 0 and even.
   - `c2` must be half the length of `path_ba`.
   - `c1` must be `c2 - 1`.
   - `i` must start at 1.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`path_ba` is a list of even length greater than 0, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is 1**
