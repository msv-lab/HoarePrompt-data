To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `path_ba` is a list containing the indices of the vertices in the shortest path from vertex `b` to vertex `0`, in reverse order.
- `previous`, `d`, `_`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- `ops` is populated based on the length of `path_ba`:
  - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples where the first element is the middle element `c` of the `path_ba` list, and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` (inclusive), with the length of the `ops` list being `ci + 1`.
  - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of `2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Length of `path_ba`**:
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` will contain tuples of the form `(c, i)` where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` ranges from 0 to `ci` (inclusive).
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` will contain pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of `2`.

2. **Map Function**:
   - The `map` function applies the lambda function `lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'` to each element in `ops`.
   - This lambda function takes a tuple `x` and formats it as a string where the first element of the tuple is incremented by 1 and the second element remains the same.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` function will print each formatted string on a new line, as specified by `sep='\n'`.

### Output Calculation:
- **Odd Length of `path_ba`**:
  - Suppose `path_ba` has an odd length, and the middle element is `c`. The `ops` list will contain tuples `(c, i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `ci`.
  - The `print` statement will output:
    ```
    c + 1 0
    c + 1 1
    ...
    c + 1 ci
    ```

- **Even Length of `path_ba`**:
  - Suppose `path_ba` has an even length, and the middle elements are `c1` and `c2`. The `ops` list will contain pairs `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of `2`.
  - The `print` statement will output:
    ```
    c1 + 1 1
    c2 + 1 1
    c1 + 1 3
    c2 + 1 3
    ...
    c1 + 1 (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)
    c2 + 1 (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)
    ```

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `path_ba`, `c`, `c1`, and `c2` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(c + 1 0
c + 1 1
...
c + 1 ci) (if the length of `path_ba` is odd) or (c1 + 1 1
c2 + 1 1
c1 + 1 3
c2 + 1 3
...
c1 + 1 (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)
c2 + 1 (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)) (if the length of `path_ba` is even)**

This output format describes the possible values that will be printed based on the given conditions.
