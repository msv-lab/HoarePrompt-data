The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is not used in the loop head. The state of `u2vs` and the edges are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
