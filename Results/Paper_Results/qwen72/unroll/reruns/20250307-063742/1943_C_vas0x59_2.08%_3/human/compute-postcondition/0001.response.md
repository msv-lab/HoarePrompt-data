Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3, and the edges are pairs of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v, representing the vertices connected by an edge. `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list containing `n` empty lists. Each element in `u2vs` is an empty list, and the length of `u2vs` is `n`. The initial state of `n` and the edges remains unchanged.
