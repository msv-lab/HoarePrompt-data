To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ops))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions that define the `ops` list:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `path_ba` is a list of indices of vertices in the shortest path from vertex `b` to vertex `0`, in reverse order.
   - `previous`, `d`, `_`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
   - The `ops` list is populated based on the length of `path_ba`.

2. **Conditions for `ops` List:**
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
     - The `ops` list contains tuples where the first element is the middle element `c` of the `path_ba` list, and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` (inclusive).
     - The length of the `ops` list is `ci + 1`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even:
     - The `ops` list contains pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of `2`.
     - The length of the `ops` list is `len(path_ba) - c1`.

3. **Determining the Length of `ops`:**
   - We need to consider the length of `path_ba` to determine the length of `ops`.
   - If `path_ba` has an odd length, the middle element `c` is used to create tuples, and the length of `ops` is `ci + 1`.
   - If `path_ba` has an even length, the length of `ops` is `len(path_ba) - c1`.

Let's analyze both cases:

### Case 1: `path_ba` has an odd length
- Suppose `path_ba` has a length of `n` where `n` is odd.
- The middle element `c` is at index `n // 2`.
- The `ops` list will contain `ci + 1` tuples, where `ci` is the value of the middle element `c`.
- Therefore, the length of `ops` will be `ci + 1`.

### Case 2: `path_ba` has an even length
- Suppose `path_ba` has a length of `n` where `n` is even.
- The `ops` list will contain pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of `2`.
- The length of `ops` will be `len(path_ba) - c1`.

Since the exact length of `path_ba` and the values of `c`, `c1`, and `c2` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output
- If `path_ba` has an odd length, the output will be `ci + 1`.
- If `path_ba` has an even length, the output will be `len(path_ba) - c1`.

Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is `ci + 1` if the length of `path_ba` is odd, and `len(path_ba) - c1` if the length of `path_ba` is even)**
