You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed in the function signature. The function reads input values for n and the edges of the tree directly from stdin. n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3, and the edges are pairs of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v, representing the vertices connected by an edge.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices (0-based) of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex by an edge. The length of each list in `u2vs` will be the degree of the corresponding vertex.

    #State: The `path_ba` list contains the indices of the vertices in the shortest path from vertex `b` to vertex `0`, in reverse order (from `b` to `0`). The `previous` list remains unchanged. The `d` list remains unchanged. The `_` variable remains unchanged. The `a` and `b` variables remain unchanged.

            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: Output State: The `ops` list now contains tuples where the first element is the middle element `c` of the `path_ba` list, and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` (inclusive). The length of the `ops` list is `ci + 1`. The `path_ba`, `previous`, `d`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `ci`, and `c` variables remain unchanged.
    else :
        c2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        c1 = c2 - 1

        #State: Output State: The `ops` list contains pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of `2`. The `path_ba` list, `previous` list, `d` list, `_` variable, `a` variable, and `b` variable remain unchanged. `c1` and `c2` also remain unchanged.
    #State: The `path_ba` list contains the indices of the vertices in the shortest path from vertex `b` to vertex `0`, in reverse order (from `b` to `0`). The `previous` list remains unchanged. The `d` list remains unchanged. The `_` variable remains unchanged. The `a` and `b` variables remain unchanged. The `ops` list is now populated based on the length of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the `ops` list contains tuples where the first element is the middle element `c` of the `path_ba` list, and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` (inclusive), with the length of the `ops` list being `ci + 1`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, the `ops` list contains pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of `2`. The `c1` and `c2` variables remain unchanged.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: len(ops) (where len(ops) is `ci + 1` if the length of `path_ba` is odd, and `len(path_ba) - c1` if the length of `path_ba` is even)

    #c1 + 1 3
    #c2 + 1 3
    #...
    #c1 + 1 (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)
    #c2 + 1 (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)) (if the length of `path_ba` is even)
    return None
    #The program returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads an integer `n` and a list of edges from standard input, where `n` is the number of vertices in a tree and each edge is a pair of integers representing connected vertices. The function does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
