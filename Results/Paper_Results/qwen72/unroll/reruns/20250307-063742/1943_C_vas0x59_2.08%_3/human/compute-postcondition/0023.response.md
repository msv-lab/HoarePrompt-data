Output State: The `ops` list contains pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of `2`. The `path_ba` list, `previous` list, `d` list, `_` variable, `a` variable, and `b` variable remain unchanged. `c1` and `c2` also remain unchanged.
