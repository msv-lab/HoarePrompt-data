Postcondition: **The `path_ba` list contains the indices of the vertices in the shortest path from vertex `b` to vertex `0`, in reverse order (from `b` to `0`). The `previous` list remains unchanged. The `d` list remains unchanged. The `_` variable remains unchanged. The `a` and `b` variables remain unchanged. The `ops` list is now populated based on the length of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the `ops` list contains tuples where the first element is the middle element `c` of the `path_ba` list, and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` (inclusive), with the length of the `ops` list being `ci + 1`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, the `ops` list contains pairs of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` in the range from `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of `2`. The `c1` and `c2` variables remain unchanged.**
