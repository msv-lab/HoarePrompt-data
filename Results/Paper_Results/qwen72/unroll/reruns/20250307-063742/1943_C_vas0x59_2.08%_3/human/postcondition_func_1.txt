The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and a list of edges from standard input, where `n` is the number of vertices in a tree and each edge is a pair of integers representing connected vertices. It constructs an adjacency list `u2vs` for the tree. The function then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from vertex `0` to find a vertex `a` with the maximum distance from `0`. Another BFS is performed starting from vertex `a` to find a vertex `b` with the maximum distance from `a`. The function computes the shortest path from `b` to `0` and populates a list `ops` based on the length of this path. If the length of the path is odd, `ops` contains tuples where the first element is the middle vertex of the path, and the second element is the index ranging from 0 to the middle index. If the length is even, `ops` contains pairs of tuples where the first elements are the two middle vertices of the path, and the second element is the index ranging from 1 to the length of the path minus the first middle index, in steps of 2. The function prints the length of `ops` and the contents of `ops` in a specific format, and returns `None`.
