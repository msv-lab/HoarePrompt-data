Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices (0-based) of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex by an edge. The length of each list in `u2vs` will be the degree of the corresponding vertex. `d` is the list of distances from vertex 0 to all other vertices after the BFS execution. `previous` is the list of previous vertices in the shortest path tree from vertex 0 to all other vertices. `_` is a variable that has been assigned a value, but it is not used. `a` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`. `b` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
