Output State: **The `path_ba` list contains the indices of the vertices in the shortest path from vertex `b` to vertex `0`, in reverse order (from `b` to `0`). The length of `path_ba` is an odd number. The `previous` list remains unchanged. The `d` list remains unchanged. The `_` variable remains unchanged. The `a` and `b` variables remain unchanged. The `ops` list is now an empty list. `ci` is the middle index of the `path_ba` list.**

Explanation: The variable `ci` is assigned the value of the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, which gives the middle index of the list since its length is an odd number. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
