The function `func_1` accepts an integer `d` within the range 0 to n-1 (inclusive), where n is the number of vertices in the graph. It prints a query string in the format `? [d]` to the standard output and then reads a line of input from the user, expecting two integers separated by a space. The function returns these two integers as a tuple `(v, u)`. After the function concludes, the program state includes the printed query and the returned tuple of integers `(v, u)` provided by the user input.
