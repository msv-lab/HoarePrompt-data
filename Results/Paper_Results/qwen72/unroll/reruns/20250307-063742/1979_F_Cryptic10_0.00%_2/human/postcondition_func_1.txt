The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^5) representing the number of vertices in a graph. It constructs a path by iteratively selecting vertices and adding them to the path until all vertices are included. The function then prints the path as a sequence of space-separated vertex numbers and flushes the output buffer. After the function concludes, the `path` contains a sequence of all vertices, and the `remaining_vertices` set is empty.
