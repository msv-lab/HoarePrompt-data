### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices, from which \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed.
   - The goal is to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using at most \( n \) queries.
   - Each query of the form `? d` returns a vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) that is not connected to \( v \). If no such vertex \( v \) exists, the response is `0 0`.
   - The strategy is to iteratively find and remove vertices with the highest possible degree to construct the Hamiltonian path.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function correctly sends a query to the interactor with the given degree \( d \).
     - It reads the response and returns the pair \( (v, u) \).
     - The function handles the query and response format correctly.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function initializes an empty path and a set of remaining vertices.
     - It iterates over possible degrees \( d \) from \( n-1 \) down to 0.
     - For each degree \( d \), it queries the interactor to find a vertex \( v \) with degree at least \( d \).
     - If \( v \) is found and is in the set of remaining vertices, it adds \( v \) to the path and removes \( v \) from the set of remaining vertices.
     - This process continues until all vertices are removed from the set of remaining vertices.
     - Finally, it prints the constructed path.

3. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach of querying from the highest degree to the lowest degree is a reasonable strategy to ensure that we are always selecting the vertex with the highest degree first, which helps in avoiding getting stuck in a suboptimal path.
   - By removing the vertex \( v \) and its edges after each query, the program effectively reduces the graph size and ensures that the remaining vertices still form a valid graph.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the interactor returns `0 0` for a degree \( d \) that does not exist in the graph.
   - The program ensures that each vertex is added to the path exactly once and in the correct order to form a Hamiltonian path.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( n = 2 \), the graph is a single edge, and the program correctly handles this by querying `? 0` and constructing the path.
   - For \( n = 3 \), the graph has one edge removed, and the program should be able to find the Hamiltonian path by querying the appropriate degrees.
   - For larger \( n \), the program should be able to handle the removal of \( n - 2 \) edges and still find a Hamiltonian path within the query limit.

5. **Query Limit**:
   - The program makes at most \( n \) queries, which is within the allowed limit.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where the interactor returns `-1` for an incorrect query or more than \( n \) queries. However, the problem description states that the interactor will return `0 0` if no vertex with the required degree is found, and the program correctly handles this.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the constructed path is a Hamiltonian path, but the problem guarantees that a Hamiltonian path always exists under the given constraints, and the program's approach should correctly construct it.

### Final Evaluation:
The program appears to correctly follow the problem constraints and logic. It queries the interactor in a way that ensures the construction of a Hamiltonian path, and it handles the responses appropriately. The approach of querying from the highest degree to the lowest degree is sound and should work for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
