Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a Hamiltonian path in a graph where exactly \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed from a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices. The solution involves making queries to identify vertices and their connections, and then constructing the path based on these queries.

### Function Analysis

1. **`func_1(d)`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function sends a query to the interactor asking for a vertex with a degree at least \( d \) and another vertex that is not connected to it.
   - **Behavior**: It prints the query `? d` and reads the response, which is a tuple `(v, u)`.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly formats the query and handles the input. It returns the tuple `(v, u)` as expected.

2. **`func_2(n)`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function constructs a Hamiltonian path by iteratively querying the graph and removing vertices.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices of the Hamiltonian path.
     - It initializes a set `remaining_vertices` with all vertices from 1 to \( n \).
     - It enters a loop that continues until `remaining_vertices` is empty.
     - Inside the loop, it iterates over possible degrees \( d \) from \( n-1 \) down to 0.
     - For each degree \( d \), it calls `func_1(d)` to get a vertex \( v \) with degree at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) that is not connected to \( v \).
     - If \( v \) is 0, it continues to the next degree.
     - If \( v \) is found in `remaining_vertices`, it adds \( v \) to the path and removes \( v \) from `remaining_vertices`.
     - The loop breaks once a valid vertex \( v \) is found and added to the path.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly uses `func_1` to query the graph.
     - It iterates over the degrees in descending order, which is a reasonable strategy to find vertices with the highest degrees first.
     - It ensures that each vertex is added to the path only once and is removed from the set of remaining vertices.
     - After constructing the path, it prints the path in the required format and flushes the output buffer.

### Interactive Constraints and Query Limit
- The function `func_2` ensures that it makes no more than \( n \) queries by breaking out of the loop once a valid vertex is found and added to the path.
- The function correctly handles the case where the interactor returns "0 0" by continuing to the next degree.

### Hamiltonian Path Construction
- The strategy of iteratively selecting vertices with the highest degree and removing them is effective because it ensures that the remaining graph is still connected and that the path can be extended.
- The function correctly constructs the path by adding vertices one by one and ensuring that all vertices are included.

### Conclusion
Given the problem constraints and the behavior of the functions, the program appears to correctly construct a Hamiltonian path in the graph using the allowed number of queries. The functions handle the interaction with the interactor and the construction of the path as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
