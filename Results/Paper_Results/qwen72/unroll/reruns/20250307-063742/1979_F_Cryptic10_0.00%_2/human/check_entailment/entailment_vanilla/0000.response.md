### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices, from which \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed.
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using at most \( n \) queries.
   - Each query of the form `? d` returns a vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) that is not connected to \( v \). If no such vertex \( v \) exists, the response is `0 0`.
   - The goal is to construct a Hamiltonian path by removing vertices and edges as we go.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function sends a query to the interactor with the given degree \( d \).
     - It reads the response and returns the pair \( (v, u) \).
     - The function correctly handles the query and response format.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function initializes an empty path and a set of remaining vertices.
     - It iterates over possible degrees \( d \) from \( n-1 \) down to 0.
     - For each degree \( d \), it queries the interactor to find a vertex \( v \) with degree at least \( d \).
     - If \( v \) is found and is in the set of remaining vertices, it adds \( v \) to the path and removes \( v \) from the set of remaining vertices.
     - This process continues until all vertices are removed from the set of remaining vertices.
     - Finally, it prints the constructed path.

3. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach of querying from the highest degree to the lowest degree ensures that we are always selecting the vertex with the highest degree first, which is a good strategy to avoid getting stuck in a suboptimal path.
   - By removing the vertex \( v \) and its edges after each query, we are effectively reducing the graph size and ensuring that the remaining vertices still form a valid graph.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the interactor returns `0 0` for a degree \( d \) that does not exist in the graph.
   - The program ensures that each vertex is added to the path exactly once and in the correct order to form a Hamiltonian path.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( n = 2 \), the graph is a single edge, and the program correctly handles this by querying `? 0` and constructing the path.
   - For \( n = 3 \), the graph has one edge removed, and the program should be able to find the Hamiltonian path by querying the appropriate degrees.

5. **Query Limit**:
   - The program makes at most \( n \) queries, which is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly follow the problem constraints and logic. It queries the interactor in a way that ensures the construction of a Hamiltonian path, and it handles the responses appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
