### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding a Hamiltonian path in a graph with \( n \) vertices and \( n - 2 \) edges removed.
   - We can use at most \( n \) queries to find the path.
   - Each query `? d` returns a vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) not connected to \( v \). If no such vertex \( v \) exists, the response is `0 0`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function sends a query to the interactor with the given degree \( d \).
     - It reads the response and returns the pair \( (v, u) \).
     - The function correctly handles the query and response format, ensuring that the input is split into two integers and returned as a tuple.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function initializes an empty path and a set of remaining vertices.
     - It iterates over possible degrees \( d \) from \( n-1 \) down to 0.
     - For each degree \( d \), it queries the interactor to find a vertex \( v \) with degree at least \( d \).
     - If \( v \) is found and is in the set of remaining vertices, it adds \( v \) to the path and removes \( v \) from the set of remaining vertices.
     - This process continues until all vertices are removed from the set of remaining vertices.
     - Finally, it prints the constructed path.

3. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - **Query Strategy**:
     - The program queries from the highest degree to the lowest degree. This strategy ensures that we are always selecting the vertex with the highest degree first, which helps in avoiding getting stuck in a suboptimal path.
     - However, this strategy might not always be optimal. For example, if the graph is such that the vertex with the highest degree is not part of the Hamiltonian path, the program might still select it, leading to incorrect paths.

   - **Handling Responses**:
     - The program correctly handles the case where the interactor returns `0 0` for a degree \( d \) that does not exist in the graph.
     - The program ensures that each vertex is added to the path exactly once and in the correct order to form a Hamiltonian path.

   - **Edge Cases**:
     - For \( n = 2 \), the graph is a single edge, and the program correctly handles this by querying `? 0` and constructing the path.
     - For \( n = 3 \), the graph has one edge removed, and the program should be able to find the Hamiltonian path by querying the appropriate degrees.

4. **Query Limit**:
   - The program makes at most \( n \) queries, which is within the allowed limit.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Suboptimal Vertex Selection**:
     - The program might select a vertex with a high degree that is not part of the Hamiltonian path. For example, if the graph is such that the vertex with the highest degree is not connected to the remaining vertices in a way that forms a Hamiltonian path, the program might fail.
     - A more robust approach would be to ensure that the selected vertex \( v \) is always part of the Hamiltonian path. This can be done by checking the connectivity of \( v \) with the remaining vertices and ensuring that it forms a valid path.

6. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly sends queries and handles responses.
   - The program maintains the state of the remaining vertices and constructs the path accordingly.
   - However, the annotations do not address the potential issue of suboptimal vertex selection, which could lead to incorrect paths in certain graph configurations.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the problem constraints and logic but might not always construct the correct Hamiltonian path due to its strategy of selecting vertices based on the highest degree. This strategy can lead to suboptimal selections, especially in graphs where the vertex with the highest degree is not part of the Hamiltonian path. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct in all cases.

Final: **False**
