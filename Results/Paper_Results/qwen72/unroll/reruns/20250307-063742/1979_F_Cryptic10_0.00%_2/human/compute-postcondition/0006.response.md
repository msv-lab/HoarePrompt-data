The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, representing the number of vertices in the graph. Since the output is not specified, we can only describe the input parameter and the general expectation that the function will return some value or perform some operation related to a graph with `n` vertices.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5. The function returns a value or performs an operation related to the graph with `n` vertices.**
