Output State: **`path` contains a sequence of vertices, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `path` list will contain a sequence of vertices that were selected and added during each iteration of the loop. The `remaining_vertices` set, which initially contained all vertices from 1 to `n`, will be empty because each vertex that was in the set has been removed and added to the `path` list. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
