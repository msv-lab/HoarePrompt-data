### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires recovering a palindrome array `a` of size `n` given all but one of its subarray sums.
   - The subarray sums provided are in arbitrary order, and the missing sum can be any of the \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\) possible subarray sums.
   - The solution must ensure that the array `a` is a palindrome and that the missing subarray sum is correctly identified.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a)`**:
     - This function computes all possible subarray sums of the input list `a` and returns them in a sorted list.
     - It is used to generate the subarray sums of a candidate palindrome array.
     - The function is correct and behaves as expected.

   - **`func_2(cts)`**:
     - This function identifies the unique elements in `cts` that appear an odd number of times.
     - It is used to filter out the sums that are likely to be the missing subarray sum.
     - The function is correct and behaves as expected.

   - **`func_3(odds, n)`**:
     - This function constructs a palindrome array `a` of length `n` based on the unique sums in `odds`.
     - It fills the array symmetrically, ensuring that the middle element (if `n` is odd) is correctly set.
     - The function is correct and behaves as expected.

   - **`func_4(bigList, smallList)`**:
     - This function compares the trailing elements of `bigList` and `smallList`, removing matching elements until a mismatch is found or `smallList` is empty.
     - It is used to identify the missing subarray sum by comparing the generated subarray sums with the provided subarray sums.
     - The function is correct and behaves as expected, but it assumes that `bigList` will not become empty, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem constraints.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the array and the subarray sums.
   - It sorts the subarray sums to facilitate the identification of the missing sum.
   - It uses `func_2` to identify the unique sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - Depending on the length of the `odds` list, it either:
     - Constructs a candidate palindrome array `b` of length `n + 2` or `n - 2` using `func_3`.
     - Generates the subarray sums of `b` using `func_1`.
     - Identifies the missing sum using `func_4`.
   - The missing sum is then added to the `odds` list, and the final palindrome array `a` is constructed using `func_3`.
   - The constructed palindrome array is printed.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the missing subarray sum by leveraging the properties of palindromic arrays and the unique sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - The construction of the palindrome array using `func_3` ensures that the array is symmetric and meets the problem requirements.
   - The program handles the edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the problem requirements. It correctly identifies the missing subarray sum and constructs a valid palindrome array `a` for each test case.
