Reasoning:

The program aims to recover a hidden palindromic array `a` from the given sums of all but one of its subarrays. Let's break down the logic and correctness of the program step by step:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the list of subarray sums `subarraySums`.

2. **Sorting Subarray Sums:**
   - The subarray sums are sorted to facilitate further processing. This is a necessary step as the order of the sums is not guaranteed.

3. **Identifying Unique Sums (func_2):**
   - `func_2` is designed to identify the unique sums that appear an odd number of times in the list of subarray sums. This is crucial because in a palindromic array, the sums of subarrays that include the middle element (if `n` is odd) or any element in the middle of the array (if `n` is even) will appear an odd number of times.
   - The function works by iterating through the sorted list and removing pairs of identical sums, leaving only the unique sums that appear an odd number of times.

4. **Determining the Missing Sum:**
   - The program checks if the number of unique sums (`odds`) is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`. If it is, it further processes the sums to determine the missing sum.
   - If there are both even and odd unique sums, the missing sum is chosen based on the length of the lists of even and odd sums.
   - If there are no even sums, it constructs a candidate array `b` using `func_3` and calculates the subarray sums of `b` using `func_1`. It then determines the missing sum by comparing these sums with the given subarray sums.

5. **Constructing the Palindromic Array (func_3):**
   - `func_3` constructs the palindromic array `a` from the list of unique sums (`odds`). It fills the array symmetrically, ensuring that the array remains a palindrome.
   - If `n` is odd, the middle element of `a` is set to the middle element of `odds`.
   - If `n` is even, the elements are filled symmetrically based on the differences between consecutive elements in `odds`.

6. **Finding the Last Unique Sum (func_4):**
   - `func_4` is used to find the last unique sum by removing trailing matching elements from `bigList` and `smallList` until they no longer match.
   - This function is used to identify the missing sum by comparing the subarray sums of the candidate array with the given subarray sums.

7. **Final Output:**
   - The program appends the missing sum to the list of unique sums, sorts it, and then constructs the final palindromic array `a` using `func_3`.
   - The constructed array `a` is printed as the output.

### Key Points:
- **Correctness of `func_2`:** This function correctly identifies the unique sums that appear an odd number of times, which is essential for determining the missing sum.
- **Correctness of `func_3`:** This function correctly constructs a palindromic array from the unique sums, ensuring that the array is symmetric.
- **Correctness of `func_4`:** This function correctly identifies the missing sum by comparing the subarray sums of the candidate array with the given subarray sums.

### Potential Issues:
- The program assumes that the missing sum can be determined by the logic in the `if` and `else` blocks. This assumption is based on the problem constraints and the properties of palindromic arrays.
- The program does not explicitly handle the case where `n` is even, but the logic in `func_3` should still work correctly by filling the array symmetrically.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem constraints and the logical steps taken by the program, the program appears to be correct in its approach to recovering a palindromic array from the given subarray sums.

Correctness: **True**
