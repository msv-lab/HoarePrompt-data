#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `cts` of integers and returns a list `odds` containing the unique elements from `cts` that appear an odd number of times, in the order they first appeared. Elements that appear an even number of times in `cts` are not included in `odds`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `odds` and an odd integer `n` (3 <= n <= 1000). It returns a list `a` of length `n` where the elements are symmetrically filled based on the values in `odds`. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `a` is set to the middle element of `odds`. The elements on either side of the middle element (if any) are filled with half the difference between consecutive elements of `odds`. The final state of the program is that `a` is a symmetric list of length `n`, and the input parameters `odds` and `n` remain unchanged.

    #The program returns the last element of `bigList` after trailing matching elements between `bigList` and `smallList` have been removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two parameters, `bigList` and `smallList`, both of which are lists of integers, with `smallList` being a subsequence of `bigList`. It removes trailing elements from both lists that match, stopping when either `smallList` is empty or the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` no longer match. The function returns the last element of `bigList` after this process. If `bigList` becomes empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`.
