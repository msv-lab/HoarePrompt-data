To ensure the loop executes for the first time, we need to consider the conditions in the loop head: `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.

1. **`len(smallList) > 0`**: This condition requires that `smallList` is not empty. If `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`, it can be empty or non-empty. To ensure the loop executes, `smallList` must have at least one element.

2. **`bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`**: This condition requires that the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`. Since `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`, it is possible that the last elements are equal, but it is not guaranteed. To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the last element of `bigList` is the same as the last element of `smallList`.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the state to ensure both conditions are met. Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers, `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`, `smallList` has at least one element, and the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`**.
