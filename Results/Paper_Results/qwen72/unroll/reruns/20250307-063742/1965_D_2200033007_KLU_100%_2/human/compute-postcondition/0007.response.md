The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `odds` and `n`. `odds` is a list of integers, and `n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000. The length of `odds` is (n + 1) // 2, and each element in `odds` is a positive integer. The function returns a list `a` of length `n`, where the elements are symmetrically filled. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `a` is the middle element of `odds`. The elements on the left and right sides of the middle element are filled with half the difference between consecutive elements of `odds`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `odds` and an odd integer `n` (3 <= n <= 1000). It returns a list `a` of length `n` where the elements are symmetrically filled based on `odds`. The middle element of `a` is the middle element of `odds`, and the elements on either side are filled with half the difference between consecutive elements of `odds`.**
