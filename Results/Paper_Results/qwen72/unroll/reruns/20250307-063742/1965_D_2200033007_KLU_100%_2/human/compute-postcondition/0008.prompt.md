You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers, and n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000. The length of odds is (n + 1) // 2, and each element in odds is a positive integer.
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        
        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: `a` is a list of length `n` where the elements are symmetrically filled with the values calculated from the elements of `odds`. The middle element of `a` (if `n` is odd) is set to the middle element of `odds`. The elements on the left and right sides of the middle element are filled with half the difference between consecutive elements of `odds`. `prev` is set to the last element of `odds`. `idx` is -1.
    return a
    #The program returns the list `a` of length `n`, where the elements are symmetrically filled. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `a` is the middle element of `odds`. The elements on the left and right sides of the middle element are filled with half the difference between consecutive elements of `odds`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `odds` and an odd integer `n` (3 <= n <= 1000). It returns a list `a` of length `n` where the elements are symmetrically filled based on `odds`. The middle element of `a` is the middle element of `odds`, and the elements on either side are filled with half the difference between consecutive elements of `odds`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `a` of length `n`, where the elements are symmetrically filled. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `a` is the middle element of `odds`. The elements on the left and right sides of the middle element are filled with half the difference between consecutive elements of `odds`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
