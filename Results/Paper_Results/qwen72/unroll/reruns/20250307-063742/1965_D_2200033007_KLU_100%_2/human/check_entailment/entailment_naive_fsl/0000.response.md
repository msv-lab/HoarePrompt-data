Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_4` is not used in the main logic of the program, and the overall structure of the program does not clearly show how the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are combined to solve the problem. Additionally, the logic in `func_3` for reconstructing the palindrome array `a` from the `odds` list may not always produce a valid palindrome, especially when the input sums are not correctly handled.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
3
1 2 3 4 1
```
The expected output is a palindrome array such as `[1, 2, 1]`. However, the provided functions do not clearly show how they would reconstruct this array from the given input. The function `func_3` may not correctly handle the distribution of values to ensure the array is a palindrome.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
