Reasoning:

1. **func_1**: This function computes the sums of all possible contiguous subarrays of the input list `a` and returns them sorted. It correctly handles the requirement to generate all subarray sums for a given palindrome array `a`.

2. **func_2**: This function identifies the unique elements from the list `cts` that appear an odd number of times. It correctly removes elements that appear an even number of times, leaving only those that appear an odd number of times. This is useful for identifying the missing subarray sum, as the missing sum will be the one that does not have a matching pair in the list of subarray sums.

3. **func_3**: This function reconstructs a palindrome array `a` from the list `odds`. It correctly fills the array symmetrically, ensuring that the array `a` is a palindrome. The function handles the middle element appropriately when `n` is odd.

4. **func_4**: This function compares the trailing elements of `bigList` and `smallList`, removing matching elements until a mismatch is found or `smallList` is empty. It returns the last element of `bigList` after this process. This is used to find the missing subarray sum by comparing the generated subarray sums with the given subarray sums.

5. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic correctly identifies the missing subarray sum by using the `func_2` and `func_4` functions.
   - It then reconstructs the palindrome array `a` using the `func_3` function.
   - The program ensures that the final array `a` is a palindrome and meets the problem's requirements.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the missing sum is an even number or an odd number.
   - It correctly reconstructs the palindrome array for both even and odd lengths of `n`.

7. **Input and Output**:
   - The program reads the input as specified and processes each test case independently.
   - The output is formatted correctly, printing the reconstructed palindrome array for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output requirements, reconstructs the palindrome array, and identifies the missing subarray sum.

Correctness: **True**
