The function `func_4` accepts two parameters, `bigList` and `smallList`, both of which are lists of integers, with `smallList` being a subsequence of `bigList`. It removes trailing elements from both lists that match, stopping when either `smallList` is empty or the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` no longer match. The function returns the last element of `bigList` after this process. If `bigList` becomes empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`.
