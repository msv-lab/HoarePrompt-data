You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two parameters, `bigList` and `smallList`, both of which are lists of integers, with `smallList` being a subsequence of `bigList`. It removes trailing elements from both lists that match, stopping when either `smallList` is empty or the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` no longer match. The function returns the last element of `bigList` after this process. If `bigList` becomes empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: We are given the sums of all but one of the subarrays of a hidden palindromic array `a`.
2. **Output**: We need to recover any possible palindromic array `a` that matches the given subarray sums.
3. **Constraints**: The array `a` is a palindrome, and the input is chosen such that there is always at least one valid solution.

### Program Analysis:

#### Function 1: `func_1(a)`
- **Purpose**: Generate all subarray sums of the array `a` and return them sorted.
- **Steps**:
  - Initialize an empty list `cts` to store the subarray sums.
  - Use nested loops to generate subarray sums:
    - Outer loop iterates over the starting index `i` of the subarray.
    - Inner loop iterates over the ending index `j` of the subarray, starting from `i`.
    - Calculate the sum of the subarray from `i` to `j` and append it to `cts`.
  - Sort the list `cts` and return it.
- **Correctness**: This function correctly generates and sorts all subarray sums of the array `a`.

#### Function 2: `func_2(cts)`
- **Purpose**: Identify the subarray sums that appear an odd number of times in the list `cts`.
- **Steps**:
  - Initialize an empty list `odds` to store the sums that appear an odd number of times.
  - Iterate over each sum `ct` in `cts`:
    - If `odds` is not empty and the last element in `odds` is equal to `ct`, remove the last element from `odds`.
    - Otherwise, append `ct` to `odds`.
  - Return the list `odds`.
- **Correctness**: This function correctly identifies the sums that appear an odd number of times. In a palindromic array, the missing subarray sum will be the one that appears an odd number of times.

#### Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`
- **Purpose**: Reconstruct the palindromic array `a` using the sums that appear an odd number of times.
- **Steps**:
  - Initialize an array `a` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
  - Initialize `prev` to 0 and `idx` to the middle index of `a`.
  - Iterate over each sum `x` in `odds`:
    - If `idx` is the middle index (i.e., `idx == n - 1 - idx`), set `a[idx]` to `x`.
    - Otherwise, set `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` to `(x - prev) // 2`.
    - Update `prev` to `x` and decrement `idx`.
  - Return the array `a`.
- **Correctness**: This function correctly reconstructs the palindromic array `a` by using the sums that appear an odd number of times. The logic ensures that the array is symmetric around the middle.

#### Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`
- **Purpose**: Find the missing subarray sum by comparing the sorted list of all subarray sums with the sorted list of given subarray sums.
- **Steps**:
  - While both lists are not empty and the last elements of both lists are equal, pop the last elements from both lists.
  - Return the last element of `bigList`.
- **Correctness**: This function correctly identifies the missing subarray sum by comparing the lists and removing the common elements from the end.

### Overall Program Correctness:
1. **Generate All Subarray Sums**: `func_1(a)` correctly generates and sorts all subarray sums of the array `a`.
2. **Identify Odd Sums**: `func_2(cts)` correctly identifies the sums that appear an odd number of times.
3. **Reconstruct Palindromic Array**: `func_3(odds, n)` correctly reconstructs the palindromic array `a` using the identified odd sums.
4. **Find Missing Sum**: `func_4(bigList, smallList)` correctly finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the lists.

Given that the input is chosen such that there is always at least one valid solution, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
