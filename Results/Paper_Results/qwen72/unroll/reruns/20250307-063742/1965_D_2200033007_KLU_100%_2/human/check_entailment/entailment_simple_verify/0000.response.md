### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to recover a palindrome array `a` from the given sums of all but one of its subarrays.
   - The input guarantees that there is always at least one valid solution.

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**
   - **`func_1(a)`:**
     - This function calculates all possible sums of contiguous subarrays of the array `a` and returns them in a sorted list.
     - The state annotations confirm that `a` remains a palindrome, and `cts` contains all subarray sums.
   - **`func_2(cts)`:**
     - This function identifies the unique elements in `cts` that appear an odd number of times.
     - The state annotations confirm that `odds` contains these unique elements.
   - **`func_3(odds, n)`:**
     - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the `odds` list.
     - The state annotations confirm that `a` is symmetrically filled based on the values in `odds`.
   - **`func_4(bigList, smallList)`:**
     - This function finds the first element in `bigList` that is not in `smallList` by removing trailing matching elements.
     - The state annotations confirm that the function returns the last element of `bigList` after removing matching elements.

3. **Main Logic Analysis:**
   - The main logic of the program iterates over each test case.
   - It sorts the given subarray sums and uses `func_2` to find the unique elements that appear an odd number of times.
   - Depending on the length of `odds`, it either:
     - Handles the case where `odds` is longer than expected by splitting into odd and even values and determining the missing sum.
     - Handles the case where `odds` is shorter than expected by reconstructing a potential palindrome and determining the missing sum.
   - The missing sum is then added to `odds`, and `func_2` is called again to ensure the list is correctly processed.
   - Finally, `func_3` is used to reconstruct the palindrome array `a` from the updated `odds` list.

4. **Challenging the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that `func_4` is not used in the main logic, but it is indeed used to determine the missing sum.
   - The overall structure of the program does show how the functions are combined to solve the problem:
     - `func_1` is used to generate subarray sums for a potential palindrome.
     - `func_2` is used to identify unique elements that appear an odd number of times.
     - `func_3` is used to reconstruct the palindrome array.
     - `func_4` is used to find the missing sum.
   - The logic in `func_3` for reconstructing the palindrome array is correct. It ensures that the array is symmetrically filled based on the values in `odds`.

5. **Testing the Program:**
   - The provided test cases in the problem description are correctly handled by the program.
   - For example, for the input:
     ```
     1
     3
     1 2 3 4 1
     ```
     The program correctly outputs `[1, 2, 1]`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was inaccurate. The program correctly handles the problem description and produces valid palindrome arrays for the given inputs. The functions are combined in a logical manner to solve the problem, and the logic in `func_3` ensures the array is a palindrome.

Final: **True**
