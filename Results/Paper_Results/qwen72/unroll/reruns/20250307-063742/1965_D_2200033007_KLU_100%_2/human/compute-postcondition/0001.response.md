Output State: **bigList and smallList will have their trailing matching elements removed, and the loop will stop when either smallList is empty or the last elements of bigList and smallList no longer match.**

In natural language, this means that the loop will continue to remove the last elements from both `bigList` and `smallList` as long as they are the same and `smallList` is not empty. Once `smallList` becomes empty or the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` no longer match, the loop will stop. The remaining elements in `bigList` and `smallList` will be those that do not match at the end, or `smallList` may be empty if all its elements matched and were removed.
