Functionality: ** The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `odds` and an odd integer `n` (3 <= n <= 1000). It returns a list `a` of length `n` where the elements are symmetrically filled based on the values in `odds`. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `a` is set to the middle element of `odds`. The elements on either side of the middle element (if any) are filled with half the difference between consecutive elements of `odds`. The final state of the program is that `a` is a symmetric list of length `n`, and the input parameters `odds` and `n` remain unchanged. **
