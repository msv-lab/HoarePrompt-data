a is a list of positive integers, and the length of a is n (3 ≤ n ≤ 1000). The input also includes the sums of \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) distinct subarrays of a, where each sum \(s_i\) is a positive integer (1 ≤ \(s_i\) ≤ \(10^9\)). The array a is guaranteed to be a palindrome, and there is always at least one valid solution.
