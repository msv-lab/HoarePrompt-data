The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function interacts with the following variables: `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000.
- `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers of length `n`, where for each `i` (0 <= i < n), -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9.
- `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n`, initially all set to `False`.
- `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`.

The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns. However, the function is likely to perform some operations on these lists and return a result based on the data provided.

Functionality: **The function interacts with variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`. It is expected to process these variables and return a result, but the specific return value is not provided in the constraints.**
