Output State: **n is an input integer, 1 <= n <= 1000; x is a list of None values of length n; y is a list of None values of length n; r is a list of None values of length n; visited is a list of False values of length n; coef is a list of None values of length n.**

The code reinitializes the `visited` list to contain `False` values for all its elements, which matches the initial state. Therefore, the only variable that is affected is `visited`, and it is now a list of `False` values of length `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
