The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is a simple string output that does not depend on any variables or objects.
- The initial state provides information about several variables and lists (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The variable `ok` is explicitly stated to be `False`, which might indicate that the graph is not bipartite or no node was visited during any DFS call. However, this does not affect the `print` statement directly.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will simply output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
