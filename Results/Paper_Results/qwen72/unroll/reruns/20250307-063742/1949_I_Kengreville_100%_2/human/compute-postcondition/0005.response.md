Output State: **n is an input integer, 1 <= n <= 1000; x is a list of None values of length n; y is a list of None values of length n; r is a list of None values of length n; visited is a list of False values of length n; coef is a list of None values of length n.**

The code `coef = [None] * n` reassigns the variable `coef` to a new list of `None` values of length `n`. Since the initial state already specifies that `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, the state of `coef` remains unchanged. All other variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`) and the value of `n` remain the same as in the initial state.
