Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and `n` sets of integers (x, y, r) from the input. It then processes these sets using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to determine if the graph represented by these sets is bipartite and if at least one node was visited. If any DFS call finds the graph to be bipartite and visits at least one node, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After the function concludes, `n` remains the same, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list where each element is `True` if the corresponding index was visited during the DFS, otherwise `False`, `coef` is a list where each element is `1` if the corresponding index was visited during the DFS, otherwise `None`, `tot` is the total number of nodes visited during the last DFS call, `bipartite` is the result of the last DFS call indicating whether the graph is bipartite, and `ok` is `True` if any DFS call found the graph to be bipartite and visited at least one node, otherwise `False`. **
