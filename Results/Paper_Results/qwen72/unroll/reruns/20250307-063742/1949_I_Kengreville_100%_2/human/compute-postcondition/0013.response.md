Output State: `n` is an input integer, 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of integers of length n; `y` is a list of integers of length n; `r` is a list of integers of length n; `visited` is a list where each element is True if the corresponding index was visited during the DFS, otherwise False; `coef` is a list where each element is 1 if the corresponding index was visited during the DFS, otherwise None; `tot` is the total number of nodes visited during the last DFS call; `bipartite` is the result of the last DFS call indicating whether the graph is bipartite; `ok` is True if any DFS call found the graph to be bipartite and visited at least one node, otherwise False.
