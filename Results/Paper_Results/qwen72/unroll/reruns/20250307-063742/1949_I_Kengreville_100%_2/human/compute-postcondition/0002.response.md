Output State: **n is an input integer, 1 <= n <= 1000; x is a list of None values of length n; y is a list of None values of length n; r is a list of integers of length n, where for each i (0 <= i < n), 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9; visited is a list of boolean values of length n, initially all set to False; coef is a list of None values of length n.**

The code snippet `y = [None] * n` reassigns the list `y` to a new list of `None` values of length `n`. The initial values of `y` (which were integers) are replaced by `None`. The other variables (`x`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`) remain unchanged. The value of `n` and the constraints on `r` and `visited` are still valid.
