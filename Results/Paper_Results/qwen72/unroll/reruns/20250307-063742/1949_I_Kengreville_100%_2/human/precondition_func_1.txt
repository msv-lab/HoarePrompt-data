i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. The variables x, y, r, visited, coef, tot, and bipartite are defined in the outer scope. x and y are lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the disk centers, respectively. r is a list of positive integers representing the radii of the disks. visited is a list of booleans indicating whether a disk has been visited during the DFS traversal. coef is a list of integers (1 or -1) indicating the current group of the disk in the bipartite check. tot is an integer representing the total sum of the coefficients of the visited disks. bipartite is a boolean indicating whether the graph formed by the disks can be divided into two groups such that no two disks in the same group are tangent.
