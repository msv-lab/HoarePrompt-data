Output State: **n is an input integer, 1 <= n <= 1000; x is a list of None values of length n; y is a list of None values of length n; r is a list of None values of length n; visited is a list of boolean values of length n, initially all set to False; coef is a list of None values of length n.**

The code snippet `r = [None] * n` reassigns the variable `r` to a new list of `None` values of length `n`. The previous state of `r` (which was a list of integers) is overwritten. All other variables remain unchanged.
