Output State: **n is an input integer, 1 <= n <= 1000; x is a list of integers of length n; y is a list of integers of length n; r is a list of integers of length n; visited is a list of False values of length n; coef is a list of None values of length n; tot is 0.**

The variable `tot` is initialized to 0, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
