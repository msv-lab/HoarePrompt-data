Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. It reads pairs of integers from an external source (e.g., standard input) until a line does not contain exactly two integers. Each pair of integers represents an edge in a tree. The function returns a list `numbers` containing all the pairs of integers read, where each pair represents an edge in the tree. The values of `n`, `t`, and `u_1` (if they exist in the calling context) remain unchanged. **
