You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to be used in a context where the input is provided externally, such as through standard input or a file, and is not directly passed as arguments to the function. The input consists of the number of nodes `n` in the tree, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, and the number of rounds `t` which is fixed at 1. The tree is represented by `n-1` edges, each connecting two nodes `u` and `v` where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. The tree has exactly two leaves. The starting node for the round is given as an integer `u_1` where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.
def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: The `numbers` list contains all the pairs of integers read from the input, each pair representing an edge in the tree. The loop terminates when an input line does not contain exactly two integers. The values of `n`, `t`, and `u_1` remain unchanged.
    return numbers
    #The program returns the list `numbers` which contains all pairs of integers read from the input, where each pair represents an edge in the tree. The loop terminates when an input line does not contain exactly two integers. The values of `n`, `t`, and `u_1` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. It reads the number of nodes `n` in a tree and the starting node `u_1` from an external source. It then reads pairs of integers representing edges in the tree until a line does not contain exactly two integers. The function returns a list `numbers` containing all the pairs of integers read, representing the edges of the tree. The values of `n`, `t`, and `u_1` remain unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `numbers` which contains all pairs of integers read from the input, where each pair represents an edge in the tree. The loop terminates when an input line does not contain exactly two integers. The values of `n`, `t`, and `u_1` remain unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
