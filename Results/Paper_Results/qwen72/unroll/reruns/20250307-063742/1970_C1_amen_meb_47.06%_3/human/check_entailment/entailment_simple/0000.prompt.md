Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to be used in a context where the input is provided externally, such as through standard input or a file, and is not directly passed as arguments to the function. The input consists of the number of nodes `n` in the tree, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, and the number of rounds `t` which is fixed at 1. The tree is represented by `n-1` edges, each connecting two nodes `u` and `v` where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. The tree has exactly two leaves. The starting node for the round is given as an integer `u_1` where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.
def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: The `numbers` list contains all the pairs of integers read from the input, each pair representing an edge in the tree. The loop terminates when an input line does not contain exactly two integers. The values of `n`, `t`, and `u_1` remain unchanged.
    return numbers
    #The program returns the list `numbers` which contains all pairs of integers read from the input, where each pair represents an edge in the tree. The loop terminates when an input line does not contain exactly two integers. The values of `n`, `t`, and `u_1` remain unchanged.
