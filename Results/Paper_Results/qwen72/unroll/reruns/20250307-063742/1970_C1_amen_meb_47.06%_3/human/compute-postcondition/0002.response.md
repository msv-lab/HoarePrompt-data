Output State: **The `numbers` list contains all the pairs of integers read from the input, each pair representing an edge in the tree. The loop terminates when an input line does not contain exactly two integers. The values of `n`, `t`, and `u_1` remain unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop reads input lines, splits each line into two integers, and appends these integers as a pair to the `numbers` list.
- The loop continues to do this until it encounters an input line that does not contain exactly two integers.
- After the loop finishes, the `numbers` list will contain all the pairs of integers that were read, where each pair represents an edge in the tree.
- The variables `n`, `t`, and `u_1` are not modified by the loop and will retain their initial values.
