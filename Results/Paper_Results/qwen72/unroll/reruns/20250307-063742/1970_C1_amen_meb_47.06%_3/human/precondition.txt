This function does not take any input parameters. However, for the problem to be solved, it is expected that the input is provided in the format described: the first line contains two integers n and t (where t is always 1 and 2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5), followed by n-1 lines describing the edges of the tree, and the last line contains the initial node where the stone is placed (1 \leq u_1 \leq n).
