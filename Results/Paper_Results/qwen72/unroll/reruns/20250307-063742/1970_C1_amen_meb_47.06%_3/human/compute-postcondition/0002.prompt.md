Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func_1` is intended to be used in a context where the input is provided externally, such as through standard input or a file, and is not directly passed as arguments to the function. The input consists of the number of nodes `n` in the tree, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, and the number of rounds `t` which is fixed at 1. The tree is represented by `n-1` edges, each connecting two nodes `u` and `v` where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. The tree has exactly two leaves. The starting node for the round is given as an integer `u_1` where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. `numbers` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    nums = input().split()
    if len(nums) != 2:
        break
    num1 = int(nums[0])
    num2 = int(nums[1])
    numbers.append([num1, num2])



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
