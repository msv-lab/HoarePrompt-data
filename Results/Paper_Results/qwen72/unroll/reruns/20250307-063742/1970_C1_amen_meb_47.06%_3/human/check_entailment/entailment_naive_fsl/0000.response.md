Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game described in the problem. The function `func_1()` reads pairs of integers from the input, which are supposed to represent the edges of the tree, but it does not construct the tree or determine the starting node for the game. Additionally, the program does not simulate the game or determine the winner based on the starting node. The logic in the main part of the program is also incorrect, as it compares the numbers in the edges and counts them, which is not relevant to the game described.

A correct implementation would need to:
1. Construct the tree from the input edges.
2. Identify the two leaves of the tree.
3. Determine the starting node for the game.
4. Simulate the game to determine the winner based on optimal play.

The provided program fails to meet these requirements, and thus it is incorrect.
