Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. It reads the number of nodes `n` in a tree and the starting node `u_1` from an external source. It then reads pairs of integers representing edges in the tree until a line does not contain exactly two integers. The function returns a list `numbers` containing all the pairs of integers read, representing the edges of the tree. The values of `n`, `t`, and `u_1` remain unchanged.**
