#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to be used in a context where the input is provided externally, such as through standard input or a file, and is not directly passed as arguments to the function. The input consists of the number of nodes `n` in the tree, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, and the number of rounds `t` which is fixed at 1. The tree is represented by `n-1` edges, each connecting two nodes `u` and `v` where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. The tree has exactly two leaves. The starting node for the round is given as an integer `u_1` where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.
def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: The `numbers` list contains all the pairs of integers read from the input, each pair representing an edge in the tree. The loop terminates when an input line does not contain exactly two integers. The values of `n`, `t`, and `u_1` remain unchanged.
    return numbers
    #The program returns the list `numbers` which contains all pairs of integers read from the input, where each pair represents an edge in the tree. The loop terminates when an input line does not contain exactly two integers. The values of `n`, `t`, and `u_1` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. It reads pairs of integers from an external source (e.g., standard input) until a line does not contain exactly two integers. Each pair of integers represents an edge in a tree. The function returns a list `numbers` containing all the pairs of integers read, where each pair represents an edge in the tree. The values of `n`, `t`, and `u_1` (if they exist in the calling context) remain unchanged.
