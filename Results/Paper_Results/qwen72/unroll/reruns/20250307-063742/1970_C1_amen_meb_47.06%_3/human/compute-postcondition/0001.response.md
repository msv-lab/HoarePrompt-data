For the given `while True:` loop, the loop condition is always `True`, meaning the loop is designed to run indefinitely unless there is a break statement within the loop body. Since the loop condition does not depend on any specific state variables, no adjustments are necessary to ensure that the loop can execute at least once.

State: **The function `func_1` is intended to be used in a context where the input is provided externally, such as through standard input or a file, and is not directly passed as arguments to the function. The input consists of the number of nodes `n` in the tree, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, and the number of rounds `t` which is fixed at 1. The tree is represented by `n-1` edges, each connecting two nodes `u` and `v` where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. The tree has exactly two leaves. The starting node for the round is given as an integer `u_1` where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. `numbers` is an empty list.**
