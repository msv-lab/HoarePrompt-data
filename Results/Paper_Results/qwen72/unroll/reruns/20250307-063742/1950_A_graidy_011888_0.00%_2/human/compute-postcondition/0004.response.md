Functionality: ** The function `func` generates and processes 1000 iterations of three random digits (x, y, z) between 1 and 9. For each iteration, it prints the three digits, followed by a string that is either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none', based on the conditions: 'peak' if x < y and y > z, 'stair' if x < y and y < z, and 'none' otherwise. After 1000 iterations, the function completes without returning any value. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` (if they exist in the calling context) remain unchanged. **
