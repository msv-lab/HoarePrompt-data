#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called within a loop that processes t test cases, where t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, the input consists of three digits a, b, and c, where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: The loop has executed 1000 iterations, and for each iteration, three random digits (x, y, z) between 1 and 9 have been generated and printed, followed by the string 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' based on the conditions. The variable `i` is now 1001, and the variable `res` holds the result of the last iteration. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` generates and processes 1000 iterations of three random digits (x, y, z) between 1 and 9. For each iteration, it prints the three digits, followed by a string that is either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none', based on the conditions: 'peak' if x < y and y > z, 'stair' if x < y and y < z, and 'none' otherwise. After 1000 iterations, the function completes without returning any value. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` (if they exist in the calling context) remain unchanged.
