You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Annotated Code: 
from random import randint

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called within a loop that processes t test cases, where t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, the input consists of three digits a, b, and c, where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: The loop has executed 1000 iterations, and for each iteration, three random digits (x, y, z) between 1 and 9 have been generated and printed, followed by the string 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' based on the conditions. The variable `i` is now 1001, and the variable `res` holds the result of the last iteration. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x == y` or `y == z`. According to the problem description, the digits should be checked to form a stair (`a < b < c`), a peak (`a < b > c`), or neither. However, the program does not account for the equality conditions, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 2`, the program will output "none" instead of "stair" (since `1 < 1 < 2` is not a valid stair, but the program should still consider the possibility of `x < y < z` and `x < y > z` without ignoring the equality cases). Additionally, the program generates random inputs instead of reading from a predefined input, which does not match the problem description.
