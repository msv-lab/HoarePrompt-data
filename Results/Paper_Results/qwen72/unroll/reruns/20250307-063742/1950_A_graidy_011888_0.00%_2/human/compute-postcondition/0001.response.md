The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to 1000, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, which is already less than or equal to 1000. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **The function should be called within a loop that processes t test cases, where t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, the input consists of three digits a, b, and c, where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. `i` is 1.**
