Output State: **The value of `t` is 0, and the list `a` contains the computed values for each test case, which are printed in reverse order as a space-separated string. The initial list `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 each time until `t` becomes 0.
- For each iteration, the loop reads an integer `n` and a space-separated list of integers `T` from the user.
- It then constructs the list `a` by starting with `[1000]` and appending the result of `a[i-1] - T[i-1]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
- The list `a` is then reversed and printed as a space-separated string.
- After all iterations, `t` is 0, and the list `a` for each test case has been printed. The initial list `x` remains unchanged because it is not used or modified within the loop.
