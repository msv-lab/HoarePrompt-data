Precondition: **The function should take a list of integers `x` as input, where `x` has a length of `n-1` and each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, the length `n` of the array `a` must satisfy 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and the sum of all `n` values across test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def find_array(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the `n-1` integers `x_2, ..., x_n` for a test case.
