You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
        a = a[::-1]
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `T` of length `n-1`, where each element `T_i` satisfies 1 ≤ T_i ≤ 500. It then computes a new list `a` of length `n` such that `a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]` for `1 ≤ i < n`, starting with `a[0] = 1000`. The list `a` is reversed and printed as a space-separated string. After processing all test cases, the value of `t` is 0, and the function does not return any value. The function does not modify any input parameters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given an array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \).
- We need to find an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that:
  - \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \le i \le n \).
  - \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements \( n \) in the array \( a \).
   - It then reads the elements \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \) and stores them in a list \( T \).

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes the list \( a \) with a single element \( 1000 \). This is a fixed value and not necessarily the correct choice for \( a_1 \).

3. **Constructing the Array \( a \):**
   - The program iterates from \( i = 1 \) to \( n-1 \) and appends \( a[i-1] - T[i-1] \) to the list \( a \).
   - This step is incorrect because \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) should equal \( x_i \), not \( a_{i-1} - x_i \).

4. **Reversing the Array:**
   - The program reverses the array \( a \) before printing it. This is unnecessary and does not affect the correctness of the solution.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array \( a \) as a space-separated string.

### Correctness Issues:
- **Initialization of \( a_1 \):**
  - The program initializes \( a_1 \) with a fixed value of \( 1000 \). This is not a valid approach because \( a_1 \) should be chosen such that the subsequent values \( a_i \) can satisfy the modulo conditions.

- **Construction of \( a_i \):**
  - The program incorrectly constructs \( a_i \) by subtracting \( T[i-1] \) from \( a[i-1] \). This does not satisfy the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \).

### Correct Approach:
- To satisfy \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \), we can choose \( a_i \) such that \( a_i = k \cdot a_{i-1} + x_i \) for some integer \( k \). A simple choice is \( k = 1 \), so \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1]  # Initialize a_1 with 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])  # Correct construction of a_i
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly construct the array \( a \) to satisfy the modulo conditions. The correct approach should involve adding \( x_i \) to \( a_{i-1} \) to ensure the modulo condition is met.

Correctness: **False**
