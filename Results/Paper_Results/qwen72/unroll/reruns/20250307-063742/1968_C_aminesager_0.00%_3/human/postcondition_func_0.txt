The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `T` of length `n-1`, where each element `T_i` satisfies 1 ≤ T_i ≤ 500. It then computes a new list `a` of length `n` such that `a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]` for `1 ≤ i < n`, starting with `a[0] = 1000`. The list `a` is reversed and printed as a space-separated string. After processing all test cases, the value of `t` is 0, and the function does not return any value. The function does not modify any input parameters.
