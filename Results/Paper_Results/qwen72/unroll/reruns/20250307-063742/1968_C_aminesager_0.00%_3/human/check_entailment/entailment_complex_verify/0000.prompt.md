You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a list of integers `x` as input, where `x` has a length of `n-1` and each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, the length `n` of the array `a` must satisfy 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and the sum of all `n` values across test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    t = int(input())

        t = t - 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        line = input('')
        
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        
        a = [1000]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
        
        a = a[::-1]
        
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: The value of `t` is 0, and the list `a` contains the computed values for each test case, which are printed in reverse order as a space-separated string. The initial list `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `T` of length `n-1`, where each element `T_i` satisfies 1 ≤ T_i ≤ 500. It then computes a new list `a` of length `n` such that `a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]` for `1 ≤ i < n`, starting with `a[0] = 1000`. The list `a` is reversed and printed as a space-separated string. After processing all test cases, the value of `t` is 0, and the function does not return any value. The function does not modify any input parameters.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the construction of the array `a` to satisfy the conditions given in the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to construct the array `a` is flawed. The program initializes `a` with a fixed value of 1000 and then tries to construct the array by subtracting the elements of `T` from the previous elements of `a`. This approach can lead to negative values in `a`, which is not allowed according to the problem constraints (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
2 4 1
```
The program will construct the array `a` as follows:
- Initialize `a` with `[1000]`.
- For `i = 1`, `a.append(1000 - 2)`, so `a` becomes `[1000, 998]`.
- For `i = 2`, `a.append(998 - 4)`, so `a` becomes `[1000, 998, 994]`.
- For `i = 3`, `a.append(994 - 1)`, so `a` becomes `[1000, 998, 994, 993]`.

The final array `a` is `[1000, 998, 994, 993]`, but this does not satisfy the condition `x_3 = a_3 % a_2` (i.e., `994 % 998` should be `4`, but it is `994`).

A correct approach would involve ensuring that each `a_i` is constructed such that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` while also ensuring that `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. One possible correct approach is to set `a_1` to a value greater than `x_2` and then construct subsequent `a_i` values accordingly.
