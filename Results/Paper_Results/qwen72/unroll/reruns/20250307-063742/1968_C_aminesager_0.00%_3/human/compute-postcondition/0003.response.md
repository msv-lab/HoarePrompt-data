The function `func` accepts a list of integers `x` and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the length `n` of the array `a` must satisfy 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and the sum of all `n` values across test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each element `x_i` in the list `x` must satisfy 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500. The function processes each test case and returns the result based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `x` and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes the list `x` and returns a result based on the constraints and relationships between the elements of `x` and the length `n` of the array `a`.**
