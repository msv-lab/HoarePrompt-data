### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The program should handle multiple test cases, each with different values of \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - The function reads \(n\) and \(m\) from input.
     - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
     - It iterates over `x` from 1 to the square root of \(n\).
     - For each `x`, it iterates over `y` from 1 to the point where \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
     - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) (i.e., \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime).
     - If they are coprime, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(n // ((x + y) \cdot x)\) and \(m // ((x + y) \cdot y)\).
     - Finally, it prints `cnt`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - The function reads the number of test cases \(t\).
     - It iterates over each test case and calls `func_1` for each one.

3. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because `cnt` is not reset between test cases.
   - This is a valid concern. However, let's verify if this is indeed the case by analyzing the program flow.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - **State Before `func_1` Call**:
     - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).
   - **State After `func_1` Call**:
     - `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
     - `cnt` is the total count of pairs \((x, y)\) where \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, and both \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\) hold true.
     - `cnt` is printed for the current test case.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - **Reset of `cnt`**:
     - In `func_1`, `cnt` is initialized to 0 at the start of each function call.
     - Since `func_1` is called for each test case in `func_2`, `cnt` is reset to 0 for each new test case.
   - **Multiple Test Cases**:
     - `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases \(t\) and calling `func_1` for each one.
     - Each call to `func_1` processes a new pair of \(n\) and \(m\) and prints the result for that test case.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment was incorrect in stating that `cnt` is not reset between test cases. `cnt` is indeed reset to 0 at the beginning of each call to `func_1`.
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the correct number of valid pairs for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
