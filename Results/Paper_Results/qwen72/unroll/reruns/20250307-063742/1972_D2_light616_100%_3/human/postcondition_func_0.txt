The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the user input, where `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`. It calculates and prints the total count of pairs `(x, y)` such that `x` and `y` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), and both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` hold true. The function does not return any value.
