Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to solve a single test case, but the problem description requires handling multiple test cases. The function `func_2` is supposed to call `func_1` for each test case, but it does not reset the `cnt` variable between test cases, leading to incorrect results for subsequent test cases.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
1 1
2 3
```
The expected output is:
```
0
1
```
However, the program will output:
```
0
1
```
for the first test case, but the `cnt` variable will not be reset, so the second test case will start with `cnt` already set to 1, leading to an incorrect output of:
```
0
2
```
This violates the problem description, which requires the correct number of valid pairs for each test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
