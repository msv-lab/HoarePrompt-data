To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
   - `cnt` is the total count of pairs `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are coprime, and both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` hold true.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `x` is determined by the square root of `n`. For example, if `n = 10`, then `x` would be `4` because `sqrt(10) â‰ˆ 3.16`, and the smallest integer greater than `3.16` is `4`.
   - `cnt` is the count of pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy the given conditions. The pairs must be coprime, and both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` must hold true.

3. **Conditions for Pairs `(x, y)`:**
   - **Coprime:** Two integers `x` and `y` are coprime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is `1`.
   - **Condition 1:** `(x + y) * x <= n`
   - **Condition 2:** `(x + y) * y <= m`

4. **Calculating `cnt`:**
   - To find `cnt`, we need to iterate over possible values of `y` and check if the pair `(x, y)` satisfies both conditions and if `x` and `y` are coprime.
   - The exact value of `cnt` depends on the specific values of `n` and `m`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, based on the given conditions, the print statement will output the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the total count of pairs (x, y) such that x and y are coprime, and both (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m hold true)**
