Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for a given `n` and `m`.
   - It iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` such that `1 <= x <= n` and `1 <= y <= m`.
   - The condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` is checked by ensuring that `gcd(x, y) == 1` and then counting the valid pairs.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The loop structure ensures that all possible pairs `(x, y)` are considered.
   - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that `x` and `y` are coprime, which is necessary for the pair to be valid.
   - The count is incremented by the minimum of the number of valid `a` and `b` values that satisfy the conditions.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the count of valid pairs for each test case, which matches the problem requirements.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
