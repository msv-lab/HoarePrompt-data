The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters based on the provided signature. However, the output is dependent on the values of `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. Since the function signature does not include these parameters, it is assumed that `n` and `m` are either defined within the function or are global variables. The function returns a value based on the relationship between `n` and `m`, but the specific output conditions are not provided in the example.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It returns a value based on the relationship between two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6), but the specific return conditions are not provided.**
