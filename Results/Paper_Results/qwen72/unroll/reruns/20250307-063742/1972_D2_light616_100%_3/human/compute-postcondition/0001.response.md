The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is not used to control the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
