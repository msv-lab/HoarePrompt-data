### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description and Input Handling:**
   - The problem requires handling multiple test cases, each with its own values of `n` and `m`.
   - The input format is such that the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, and each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` reads `n` and `m` from the input and calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates over `x` from 1 to the square root of `n` (inclusive).
   - For each `x`, it iterates over `y` from 1 to the largest `y` such that both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` hold true.
   - It checks if `gcd(x, y) == 1` and, if so, increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
   - Finally, it prints `cnt`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then calls `func_1` `t` times, each time handling a new test case.
   - The `cnt` variable is reset to 0 at the beginning of each call to `func_1`.

4. **Original Assessment Challenge:**
   - The original assessment states that `cnt` is not reset between test cases, leading to incorrect results.
   - However, the annotated code and the actual implementation of `func_1` show that `cnt` is initialized to 0 at the beginning of each call to `func_1`.
   - This means that `cnt` is reset for each test case, and the program should handle each test case independently.

5. **Verification of Example Input:**
   - For the input:
     ```
     2
     1 1
     2 3
     ```
   - The expected output is:
     ```
     0
     1
     ```
   - The program will correctly output:
     ```
     0
     1
     ```
   - This is because `cnt` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each call to `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program correctly handles multiple test cases by resetting the `cnt` variable at the beginning of each call to `func_1`. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
