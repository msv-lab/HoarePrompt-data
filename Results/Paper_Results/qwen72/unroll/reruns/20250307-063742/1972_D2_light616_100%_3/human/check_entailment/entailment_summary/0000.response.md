### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
   - It iterates over all possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) (i.e., \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime).
   - If they are coprime, it counts the number of valid pairs \((x, y)\) by adding the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\) to the count.
   - Finally, it prints the count of valid pairs.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads an integer \(t\) from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` exactly \(t\) times, each time processing a new test case.

4. **Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find pairs \((x, y)\) where \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime and the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\) is satisfied.
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases \(t\) and calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - The constraints \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\) are respected in the function `func_1` by the conditions in the while loops.
   - The function `func_1` prints the result for each test case, and `func_2` ensures that this is done for all test cases.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the case where \(n\) and \(m\) are small (e.g., \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\)).
   - The function `func_1` also correctly handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it meets the problem description and handles all the given constraints and edge cases.

**Correctness: True**
