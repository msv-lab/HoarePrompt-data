### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of valid pairs \((x, y)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The loop `while x * x <= n` ensures that \(x\) is iterated up to the square root of \(n\), which is a common optimization for problems involving divisors.
   - Inside the loop, \(y\) is iterated starting from 1.
   - The condition `while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` ensures that both \(a\) and \(b\) are within the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1` condition checks if \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).
   - The `cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` line increments the count by the minimum of the two possible values, which ensures that both \(a\) and \(b\) are within their respective bounds.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases \(t\) and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to compute the number of valid pairs and print the result.
   - The state of `t` remains unchanged after the loop, which is correct as it is only used to control the number of test cases.

4. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case.
   - The conditions and constraints are respected, and the program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
