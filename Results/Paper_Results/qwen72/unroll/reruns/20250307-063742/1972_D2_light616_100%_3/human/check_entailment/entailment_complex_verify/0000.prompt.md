You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`, `cnt` is the total count of pairs `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are coprime, and both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` hold true.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the total count of pairs (x, y) such that x and y are coprime, and both (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m hold true)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the user input, where `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`. It calculates and prints the total count of pairs `(x, y)` such that `x` and `y` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), and both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` hold true. The function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, and then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to solve a single test case, but the problem description requires handling multiple test cases. The function `func_2` is supposed to call `func_1` for each test case, but it does not reset the `cnt` variable between test cases, leading to incorrect results for subsequent test cases.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
1 1
2 3
```
The expected output is:
```
0
1
```
However, the program will output:
```
0
1
```
for the first test case, but the `cnt` variable will not be reset, so the second test case will start with `cnt` already set to 1, leading to an incorrect output of:
```
0
2
```
This violates the problem description, which requires the correct number of valid pairs for each test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
