### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \equiv 0 \pmod{a + b}\) implies that \(a + b\) must divide \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem for a single test case.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates over possible values of `x` such that \(x \cdot x \le n\). This ensures that `x` is at most \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` such that \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\). This ensures that both \(a\) and \(b\) are within their respective bounds.
   - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), which means \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.
   - If \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, it calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a = (x + y) \cdot x\) and \(b = (x + y) \cdot y\) and adds this count to `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints the count `cnt`.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` is designed to handle multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to solve the problem for that test case.
   - The function does not return any value, and it correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is based on the idea that if \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, then \(a = (x + y) \cdot x\) and \(b = (x + y) \cdot y\) will satisfy the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \equiv 0 \pmod{a + b}\).
   - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are in their simplest form, and the multiplication by \((x + y)\) ensures that \(a\) and \(b\) are within the bounds \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
   - The count of valid pairs is correctly calculated using the `min` function to ensure that both \(a\) and \(b\) are within their respective bounds.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The nested loops ensure that all possible pairs \((x, y)\) are considered.
   - The condition \(x \cdot x \le n\) limits the number of iterations for `x`, making the solution efficient for the given constraints.
   - The inner loop also ensures that the pairs \((a, b)\) are within the bounds, further optimizing the solution.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where \(n\) and \(m\) are small (e.g., \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\)).
   - The function also handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) as specified in the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem for multiple test cases. The nested loops and the use of the `gcd` function ensure that all valid pairs are counted, and the solution is efficient for the given constraints.

Final: **True**
