Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_2` correctly handles the input for multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Pair Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the user input.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of `x` and `y`:
     - The outer loop runs while `x * x <= n`, which ensures that `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
     - The inner loop runs while both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true, which ensures that the pairs `(x, y)` are within the bounds of `n` and `m`.
     - Inside the inner loop, it checks if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, which means `x` and `y` are coprime.
     - If `x` and `y` are coprime, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. This is correct because it counts the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `a = (x + y) * x` and `b = (x + y) * y`.

3. **Output**: The function `func_1` prints the count of valid pairs `cnt` for each test case. This matches the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the test case `(1, 1)`, the function correctly prints `0` because no pairs satisfy the conditions.
   - For the test case `(2, 3)`, the function correctly prints `1` because the pair `(2, 2)` satisfies the conditions.
   - For the test case `(10, 8)`, the function correctly prints `6` because the pairs `(2, 2)`, `(3, 6)`, `(4, 4)`, `(6, 3)`, `(6, 6)`, and `(8, 8)` satisfy the conditions.

5. **Efficiency**: The nested loops ensure that the function efficiently counts the valid pairs by leveraging the properties of coprime numbers and the constraints of the problem.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem and handles the input and output as specified.

Correctness: **True**
