You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, and then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \equiv 0 \pmod{a + b}\) implies that \(a + b\) must divide \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem for a single test case.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates over possible values of `x` such that \(x \cdot x \le n\).
   - For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` such that \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), which means \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.
   - If \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, it calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a = (x + y) \cdot x\) and \(b = (x + y) \cdot y\) and adds this count to `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints the count `cnt`.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` is designed to handle multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to solve the problem for that test case.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is based on the idea that if \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, then \(a = (x + y) \cdot x\) and \(b = (x + y) \cdot y\) will satisfy the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \equiv 0 \pmod{a + b}\).
   - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) ensures that \(a\) and \(b\) are in their simplest form, and the multiplication by \((x + y)\) ensures that \(a\) and \(b\) are within the bounds \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
   - The count of valid pairs is correctly calculated using the `min` function to ensure that both \(a\) and \(b\) are within their respective bounds.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The nested loops ensure that all possible pairs \((x, y)\) are considered.
   - The condition \(x \cdot x \le n\) limits the number of iterations for `x`, making the solution efficient for the given constraints.
   - The inner loop also ensures that the pairs \((a, b)\) are within the bounds, further optimizing the solution.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where \(n\) and \(m\) are small (e.g., \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\)).
   - The function also handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) as specified in the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem for multiple test cases. The nested loops and the use of the `gcd` function ensure that all valid pairs are counted, and the solution is efficient for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
