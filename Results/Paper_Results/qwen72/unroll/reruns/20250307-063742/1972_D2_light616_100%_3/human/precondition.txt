The function should accept two parameters, n and m, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases should not exceed 2 * 10^6.
