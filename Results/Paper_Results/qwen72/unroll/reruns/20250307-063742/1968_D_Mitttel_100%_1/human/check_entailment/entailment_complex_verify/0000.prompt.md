You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and p are lists of integers of the same length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n. s is a list of two integers [P_B, P_S] representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively, such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n. k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1

    #State: The loop will terminate when either `k` becomes 0 or `vis[s]` becomes 1. The final values of `vis`, `mx`, `cur`, and `k` will depend on the specific values of `a`, `p`, `s`, and the initial `k`.
    return mx
    #The program returns the value of `mx`, which is the maximum value encountered during the execution of the loop, based on the specific values of `a`, `p`, `s`, and the initial `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a` (a list of integers), `p` (a list of integers), `s` (a list of two integers representing starting positions), and `k` (a positive integer). It returns the maximum value encountered during the execution of a loop, which is calculated as the maximum of `cur + k * a[s]` at each iteration, where `cur` is the cumulative sum of elements in `a` accessed by the positions in `p` starting from the positions in `s`, and `k` is decremented with each iteration. The loop terminates when either `k` becomes 0 or a position in `s` is revisited (i.e., `vis[s]` becomes 1). The function does not modify the input parameters `a`, `p`, or `s`, but it updates the internal state variables `vis`, `mx`, `cur`, and `k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are the same. According to the problem description, if both players start at the same position, they should follow the same sequence of moves and end up with the same score, resulting in a draw. However, the function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score for each player independently, which can lead to incorrect results if both players start at the same position.

Example case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
4 2 3 3
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6

Expected Output:
Draw

Actual Output:
Bodya or Sasha (depending on the implementation of func_1)
```

In this case, both Bodya and Sasha start at position 3, and they should end up with the same score, leading to a draw. However, the program might incorrectly determine a winner.
