### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where Bodya and Sasha start at the same position. However, this assessment is based on a misunderstanding of the function `func_1`.

Let's break down the function `func_1` and its behavior:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mx` is initialized to 0.
   - `cur` is initialized to 0.
   - `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n`.

2. **Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as the current position `s` has not been visited (`vis[s]` is 0) and `k` is greater than 0.
   - In each iteration:
     - The current position `s` is marked as visited (`vis[s] = 1`).
     - `mx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`.
     - `cur` is incremented by `a[s]`.
     - `k` is decremented by 1.
     - The player moves to the position `p[s]`.

3. **Return**:
   - The function returns the maximum score `mx` calculated during the loop.

### Analysis:

- **Same Starting Position**:
  - If Bodya and Sasha start at the same position, they will follow the same sequence of moves and accumulate the same score.
  - The function `func_1` will be called with the same starting position and the same `k` for both players.
  - Since the function `func_1` is deterministic and the inputs are identical, the function will return the same score for both players.
  - Therefore, the program will correctly output "Draw" when both players start at the same position.

- **Different Starting Positions**:
  - If Bodya and Sasha start at different positions, they will follow different sequences of moves and accumulate different scores.
  - The function `func_1` will be called with different starting positions and the same `k` for both players.
  - The function will return different scores for each player based on their respective sequences of moves.
  - The program will correctly determine the winner based on the higher score.

### Example Case:

Consider the example case provided in the original assessment:
```
Input:
1
4 2 3 3
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

- **Bodya and Sasha start at position 3**:
  - `func_1(a, p, 3 - 1, 2)` is called for both players.
  - The sequence of moves for both players will be:
    - Start at position 2 (0-indexed).
    - First turn: Move to position 2, score increases by `a[2] = 5`.
    - Second turn: Stay at position 2, score increases by `a[2] = 5`.
  - Both players will have a final score of 10.
  - The program will output "Draw".

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is incorrect. The program correctly handles the case where Bodya and Sasha start at the same position by calling `func_1` with the same inputs, which ensures that both players will have the same score and the program will output "Draw".

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
