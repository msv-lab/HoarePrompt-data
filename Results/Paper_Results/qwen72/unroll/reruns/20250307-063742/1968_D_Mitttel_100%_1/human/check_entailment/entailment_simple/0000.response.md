### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 from each element to convert them to 0-based indexing, which is a common practice in Python.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the game for a single player starting at position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score the player can achieve.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score.
   - It initializes a list `vis` of length `n` with all elements set to 0, which will keep track of visited positions to detect cycles.
   - The loop continues as long as the current position `s` has not been visited (`vis[s] == 0`) and `k` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - The current position `s` is marked as visited.
     - The maximum score `mx` is updated to be the maximum of the current `mx` and the score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns (`cur + k * a[s]`).
     - The current score `cur` is increased by the value at the current position `a[s]`.
     - The number of remaining turns `k` is decremented by 1.
     - The player moves to the next position `p[s]`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The scores for Bodya and Sasha are calculated by calling `func_1` with their respective starting positions.
   - The program then compares the scores and prints the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".

### Analysis of the Function `func_1`:
- **Cycle Detection:**
  - The loop terminates when either `k` becomes 0 or the current position `s` has been visited (`vis[s] == 1`).
  - This ensures that the function correctly handles cycles in the permutation, preventing infinite loops.

- **Score Calculation:**
  - The score is updated in two ways:
    - `mx` is updated to the maximum possible score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns.
    - `cur` is updated to the current score after each turn.
  - The final score returned is the maximum score encountered during the execution of the loop.

### Potential Issues:
- **Index Adjustment:**
  - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1, which is correct for converting 1-based indices to 0-based indices.
  - However, the function `func_1` is called with `pb - 1` and `ps - 1`, which is also correct.

- **Score Calculation Logic:**
  - The logic for updating `mx` with `cur + k * a[s]` is intended to account for the maximum possible score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns.
  - This logic is correct because it considers the best possible score for the remaining turns.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly simulate the game and determine the winner based on the given problem description. The logic for handling cycles and updating scores is sound.
