Output State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n. `s` is a list of two integers [P_B, P_S] representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively, such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n. `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is 0.**

The variable `mx` is initialized to 0, and the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.
