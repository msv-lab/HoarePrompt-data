To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to evaluate the conditions in the loop head: `not vis[s]` and `k > 0`.

1. **Condition `not vis[s]`:**
   - `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0.
   - `s` is a list of two integers `[P_B, P_S]` representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - For the loop to execute, `vis[s]` must be `False`. Since `vis` is initialized with all elements as 0, `vis[s]` will be `False` as long as `s` contains valid indices (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n).

2. **Condition `k > 0`:**
   - `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
   - For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0. Since `k` is already a positive integer, this condition is already satisfied.

Given these conditions, the only state that needs to be ensured is that `s` contains valid indices (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n) and that `vis[s]` is `False`. Since `vis` is initialized with all elements as 0, `vis[s]` will be `False` as long as `s` contains valid indices.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be:
State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n. `s` is a list of two integers [P_B, P_S] representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively, such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n. `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is 0. `cur` is 0. `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0.**
