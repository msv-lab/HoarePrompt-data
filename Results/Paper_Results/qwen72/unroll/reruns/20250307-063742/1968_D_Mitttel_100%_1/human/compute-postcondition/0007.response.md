The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, `p`, `s`, and `k`. 

- `a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `p` is a list of integers of the same length `n`, where each element `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n.
- `s` is a list of two integers `[P_B, P_S]` representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively, such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.

The function returns the maximum value encountered during the execution of the loop, based on the specific values of `a`, `p`, `s`, and the initial `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `a`, `p`, `s`, and `k`. It returns the maximum value encountered during the execution of the loop, based on the specific values of these parameters.**
