a and p are lists of integers of the same length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), where each element of p is a unique integer from 1 to n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) and each element of a is a positive integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). s is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n). k is a positive integer representing the number of turns (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).
