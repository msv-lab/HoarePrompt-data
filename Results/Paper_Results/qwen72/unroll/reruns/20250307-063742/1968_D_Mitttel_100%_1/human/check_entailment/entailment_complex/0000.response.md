### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the inputs for each test case.
   - It converts the starting positions `pb` and `ps` to 0-based indices by subtracting 1, which is necessary because Python lists are 0-based.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the game for a single player starting from position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It initializes a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops.
   - The loop runs as long as the current position `s` has not been visited and `k` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop, it updates the maximum score `mx` by considering the current score `cur` plus the remaining turns `k` times the score at the current position `a[s]`.
   - It then adds the score at the current position `a[s]` to `cur` and moves to the next position `p[s]`.
   - The loop terminates when either `k` becomes 0 or the current position `s` is revisited.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score for each player by considering the best strategy (staying or moving) at each step.
   - The final score is the maximum value encountered during the loop, which is stored in `mx`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 1 and the starting positions are the same.
   - It also handles the case where the permutation is a cycle and the game lasts for a large number of turns (`k` up to \(10^9\)).

### Potential Issues:
- **Indexing Error:** The program subtracts 1 from the elements of `a` and `p` in the loop, which is incorrect. The elements of `a` and `p` should not be modified in this way. The subtraction should only be applied to the starting positions `pb` and `ps`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1  # Convert permutation to 0-based index
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    return mx
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as shown above.
- **False** if the program is not corrected and the elements of `a` and `p` are incorrectly modified.

Given the corrected code, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect modification of `a` and `p` elements in the loop).
