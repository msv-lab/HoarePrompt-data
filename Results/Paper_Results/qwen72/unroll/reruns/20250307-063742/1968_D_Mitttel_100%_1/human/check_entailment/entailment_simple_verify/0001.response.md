### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 from each element. This is incorrect because the elements of `p` and `a` should remain as they are, and only the starting positions `pb` and `ps` should be adjusted by subtracting 1.
   - The starting positions `pb` and `ps` are correctly adjusted by subtracting 1.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the game for a given starting position `s` and a number of turns `k`.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score the player can achieve.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score.
   - It initializes a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions in the permutation to avoid infinite loops.

4. **Game Simulation:**
   - The function uses a while loop to simulate the game. The loop continues as long as the current position `s` has not been visited and there are still turns left (`k > 0`).
   - Inside the loop, it marks the current position `s` as visited.
   - It updates `mx` to the maximum of its current value and the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns.
   - It adds the score at the current position `a[s]` to `cur`.
   - It decrements `k` by 1 to account for the turn taken.
   - It moves the player to the next position `p[s]`.

5. **Output:**
   - After simulating the game for both Bodya and Sasha, the program compares their final scores.
   - If the scores are equal, it prints "Draw".
   - If Bodya's score is greater, it prints "Bodya".
   - If Sasha's score is greater, it prints "Sasha".

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The function `func_1` correctly simulates the game by considering the score at each position and the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns.
- The use of the `vis` list ensures that the function does not get stuck in an infinite loop, which is a common issue when dealing with permutations.
- The logic of updating `mx` to the maximum of its current value and the potential score if the player stays at the current position is correct, as it accounts for the possibility of the player staying at a high-scoring position for multiple turns.

### Potential Issues:
- The program incorrectly adjusts the elements of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1. This is a significant error because it changes the values of the permutation and the array, leading to incorrect results.
- The starting positions `pb` and `ps` are correctly adjusted by subtracting 1, but the elements of `p` and `a` should remain unchanged.

### Corrected Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pb -= 1
    ps -= 1
    A = func_1(a, p, pb, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s] - 1  # Adjust the position to 0-based index
    return mx
```

### Final Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in adjusting the elements of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1, which is incorrect.
- The corrected program should work as intended.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying the logical error in the program. The program is indeed incorrect due to the unnecessary and incorrect adjustment of the elements of `p` and `a`.

Final: **False**
