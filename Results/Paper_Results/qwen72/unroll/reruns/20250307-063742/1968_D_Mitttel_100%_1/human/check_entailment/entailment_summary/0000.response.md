Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to solve the "Permutation game" problem described. The program reads multiple test cases, each with a permutation `p`, an array `a`, and starting positions for Bodya and Sasha. It then calculates the maximum possible score for each player using the function `func_1` and determines the winner based on these scores.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Parameters**:
  - `a`: The array of scores.
  - `p`: The permutation array.
  - `s`: The starting position (0-indexed).
  - `k`: The number of turns.

- **Initialization**:
  - `n = len(p)`: Length of the permutation array.
  - `mx = 0`: Variable to store the maximum score.
  - `cur = 0`: Variable to store the current cumulative score.
  - `vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]`: A list to keep track of visited positions.

- **Loop**:
  - The loop runs as long as the current position `s` has not been visited (`not vis[s]`) and `k` is greater than 0.
  - `vis[s] = 1`: Mark the current position as visited.
  - `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`: Update the maximum score considering the current cumulative score and the remaining turns.
  - `cur += a[s]`: Add the score at the current position to the cumulative score.
  - `k -= 1`: Decrement the number of turns.
  - `s = p[s]`: Move to the next position in the permutation.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Adjustment of `a` and `p`**:
   - The program subtracts 1 from each element in `a` and `p` to convert them to 0-indexed. However, this is incorrect because `a` should not be adjusted in this way. The elements of `a` represent scores, and subtracting 1 from them would change their values, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Loop Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when a position is revisited (`vis[s]` becomes 1) or when `k` becomes 0. This is correct because revisiting a position means the player is in a cycle, and the score can be calculated based on the cycle.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The score calculation `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` is intended to find the maximum possible score by considering the remaining turns and the current position's score. However, this might not always be the correct approach, especially if the player is in a cycle. The correct approach should consider the total score accumulated in the cycle and the number of complete cycles that can be made within the remaining turns.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct. Specifically, the incorrect adjustment of `a` and `p` and the potentially flawed score calculation logic can lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
