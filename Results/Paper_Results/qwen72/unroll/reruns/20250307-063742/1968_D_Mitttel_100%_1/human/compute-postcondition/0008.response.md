Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a` (a list of integers), `p` (a list of integers), `s` (a list of two integers representing starting positions), and `k` (a positive integer). It returns the maximum value encountered during the execution of a loop, which is calculated as the maximum of `cur + k * a[s]` at each iteration, where `cur` is the cumulative sum of elements in `a` accessed by the positions in `p` starting from the positions in `s`, and `k` is decremented with each iteration. The loop terminates when either `k` becomes 0 or a position in `s` is revisited (i.e., `vis[s]` becomes 1). The function does not modify the input parameters `a`, `p`, or `s`, but it updates the internal state variables `vis`, `mx`, `cur`, and `k`. **
