Output State: **The loop will terminate when either `k` becomes 0 or `vis[s]` becomes 1. The final values of `vis`, `mx`, `cur`, and `k` will depend on the specific values of `a`, `p`, `s`, and the initial `k`.**

### Explanation:
- **`vis[s]`**: This list will have 1s at the positions that Bodya and Sasha have visited during the loop execution. The loop will terminate if `s` (the current position of either Bodya or Sasha) has already been visited.
- **`mx`**: This variable will store the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop execution. It will be updated each time the loop runs.
- **`cur`**: This variable will be the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` at the positions visited by `s`.
- **`k`**: This variable will be decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The loop will terminate when `k` reaches 0 or when `vis[s]` becomes 1.
- **`s`**: This variable will be updated to the value of `p[s]` in each iteration, representing the next position to visit.

The final state of these variables will depend on the specific values of `a`, `p`, `s`, and the initial `k`. If `k` reaches 0 before `vis[s]` becomes 1, the loop will terminate with `k` being 0. If `vis[s]` becomes 1 before `k` reaches 0, the loop will terminate with `vis[s]` being 1. The values of `mx` and `cur` will be the maximum and cumulative sums encountered up to that point, respectively.
