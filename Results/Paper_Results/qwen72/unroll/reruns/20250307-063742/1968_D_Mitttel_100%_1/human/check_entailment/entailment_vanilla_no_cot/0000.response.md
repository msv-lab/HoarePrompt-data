Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Adjustment of Arrays `a` and `p`:**
   - The program adjusts the elements of `a` and `p` by subtracting 1 from each element. This is incorrect because the elements of `p` and `a` are already 1-indexed, and the positions `pb` and `ps` are also 1-indexed. The correct adjustment should only be applied to `pb` and `ps` to convert them to 0-indexed positions.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Score:**
   - The function `func_1` aims to calculate the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` over `k` turns. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. The variable `mx` is updated to the maximum of `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]`, which is not the correct way to simulate the game. The score should be accumulated based on the actual moves and the values in `a` at each position.

3. **Cycle Detection and Handling:**
   - The program does not correctly handle cycles in the permutation. If a player enters a cycle, the score should be calculated based on the number of complete cycles and the remaining moves. The current implementation does not account for this.

### Corrected Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:

1. **Adjust the starting positions to 0-indexed:**
   - Convert `pb` and `ps` to 0-indexed positions by subtracting 1.

2. **Simulate the game for each player:**
   - Track the score and the position for each player over `k` turns.
   - Use a loop to simulate each turn, updating the score and the position based on the rules of the game.
   - If a player enters a cycle, calculate the score for the complete cycles and the remaining moves separately.

3. **Compare the final scores:**
   - After simulating the game for both players, compare their final scores to determine the winner.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def simulate_game(a, p, start, k):
    n = len(p)
    score = 0
    pos = start
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    cycle_start = -1
    cycle_sum = 0
    cycle_length = 0
    
    for i in range(k):
        score += a[pos]
        if vis[pos] == 0:
            vis[pos] = i + 1
            pos = p[pos]
        else:
            cycle_start = vis[pos] - 1
            cycle_length = i + 1 - cycle_start
            cycle_sum = sum(a[p[j] - 1] for j in range(cycle_start, i + 1))
            break
    
    if cycle_start != -1:
        remaining_turns = k - cycle_start
        full_cycles = remaining_turns // cycle_length
        score += full_cycles * cycle_sum
        remaining_turns %= cycle_length
        for _ in range(remaining_turns):
            score += a[pos]
            pos = p[pos]
    
    return score

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1  # Convert permutation to 0-indexed
    pb -= 1  # Convert starting positions to 0-indexed
    ps -= 1  # Convert starting positions to 0-indexed
    
    A = simulate_game(a, p, pb, k)
    B = simulate_game(a, p, ps, k)
    
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Function `simulate_game`:**
   - This function simulates the game for a player starting at position `start` for `k` turns.
   - It uses a `vis` array to track visited positions and detect cycles.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the complete cycles and the remaining moves separately.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - For each test case, it reads the input, converts the permutation and starting positions to 0-indexed, and simulates the game for both players.
   - It then compares the final scores and prints the result.

This corrected program should handle all the test cases correctly.
