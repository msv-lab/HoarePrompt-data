Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are the same. According to the problem description, if both players start at the same position, they should follow the same sequence of moves and end up with the same score, resulting in a draw. However, the function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score for each player independently, which can lead to incorrect results if both players start at the same position.

Example case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
4 2 3 3
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6

Expected Output:
Draw

Actual Output:
Bodya or Sasha (depending on the implementation of func_1)
```

In this case, both Bodya and Sasha start at position 3, and they should end up with the same score, leading to a draw. However, the program might incorrectly determine a winner.
