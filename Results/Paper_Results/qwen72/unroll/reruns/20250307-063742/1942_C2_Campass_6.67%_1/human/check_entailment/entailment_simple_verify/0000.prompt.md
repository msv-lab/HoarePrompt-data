You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, n is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), x is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), and y is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x). The list of x vertices chosen by Bessie contains distinct integers from 1 to n. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it processes the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input. The variable `cons` is calculated based on the values in the list `l` and the variables `x` and `y`. After all iterations, the final value of `t` is 0, and the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are the last set of values read from the input. The list `l` and the variable `cons` are reinitialized and recalculated for each iteration, so their final values are based on the last iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. One specific issue is that the logic for calculating the number of triangles formed by the chosen vertices and the additional vertices you can choose is flawed. The program attempts to calculate the number of segments between chosen vertices and then tries to maximize the number of triangles by adding additional vertices, but it does not correctly account for the constraints and the geometric properties of the polygon.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5 2 1
1 3
```
- **n = 5**: The cake is a pentagon.
- **x = 2**: Bessie has chosen vertices 1 and 3.
- **y = 1**: You can choose 1 additional vertex.

**Expected Output:**
The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out is 3. You can choose vertex 2, and the triangles formed are (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 4), and (1, 3, 5).

**Actual Output:**
The program outputs 2, which is incorrect.

### Explanation of the Failure:
- The program calculates the segments between the chosen vertices (1 and 3) and finds that there are two segments: one of length 1 (between 1 and 3) and one of length 1 (between 3 and 1, considering the polygon's cyclic nature).
- The program then tries to add additional vertices to these segments, but it does not correctly handle the cyclic nature of the polygon and the possibility of forming multiple triangles by adding a single vertex.

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
