Output State: **The function `R` is defined as a lambda function that maps the input values (split by spaces) to integers. The initial state variables `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and the list of x vertices chosen by Bessie still contains distinct integers from 1 to n. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5.**

The lambda function `R` is now defined to read input values, split them by spaces, and convert them to integers. This function can be used to read multiple integer values from a single input line. The initial state variables and conditions remain valid and unchanged.
