The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of sides of a polygon `n`, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen `x`, and the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose `y`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of non-adjacent vertices that can be chosen from the remaining vertices, ensuring that the total number of chosen vertices does not exceed `n - 2`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ends with `t` set to 0, and the last processed values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are the final values of these variables.
