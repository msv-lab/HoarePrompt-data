Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Handling of Diagonals and Triangles:**
   - The program attempts to count the number of segments between chosen vertices and then tries to add additional vertices to maximize the number of triangles. However, it does not correctly handle the formation of non-intersecting diagonals and the resulting triangles.

2. **Logic for Adding Vertices:**
   - The logic for adding vertices to maximize the number of triangles is flawed. The program sorts the segments and tries to add vertices in a way that does not guarantee the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles.

3. **Calculation of `sx`:**
   - The variable `sx` is used to count the number of segments of length 1, but it is not correctly used to form triangles. The program adds segments to `sx` without considering the constraints and the correct way to form triangles.

4. **Final Calculation of `cons`:**
   - The final calculation of `cons` is incorrect. The program subtracts 2 from the sum of `x` and `sx`, but this does not correctly account for the number of triangles that can be formed.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
1. **Identify the Segments:**
   - Identify the segments between the chosen vertices and calculate the number of triangles that can be formed within each segment.
2. **Add Vertices:**
   - Add vertices in a way that maximizes the number of non-intersecting triangles. This involves a more sophisticated approach to ensure that the added vertices do not cause intersections.
3. **Count Triangles:**
   - Count the total number of triangles that can be formed by the chosen and added vertices, ensuring that the diagonals do not intersect.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
Here is a more correct approach to solve the problem:

```python
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        vertices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        vertices.sort()
        vertices.append(vertices[0] + n)
        
        segments = [vertices[i] - vertices[i-1] - 1 for i in range(1, x + 1)]
        segments.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Initial number of triangles from the chosen vertices
        triangles = x - 2
        
        # Add vertices to maximize the number of triangles
        for segment in segments:
            if y == 0:
                break
            if segment >= 2:
                add_vertices = min(segment - 1, y)
                triangles += add_vertices
                y -= add_vertices
        
        print(triangles)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
1. **Identify Segments:**
   - The program identifies the segments between the chosen vertices and appends the first vertex shifted by `n` to handle the circular nature of the polygon.
2. **Sort Segments:**
   - The segments are sorted in descending order to prioritize larger segments for adding vertices.
3. **Initial Triangles:**
   - The initial number of triangles is calculated as `x - 2` because a polygon with `x` vertices can be divided into `x - 2` triangles.
4. **Add Vertices:**
   - The program iterates through the segments and adds vertices to maximize the number of triangles, ensuring that the added vertices do not exceed the limit `y`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly maximizes the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
