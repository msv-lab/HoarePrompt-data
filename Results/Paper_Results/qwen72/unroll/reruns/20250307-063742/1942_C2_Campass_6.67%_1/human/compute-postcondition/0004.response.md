The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts three parameters: `n`, `x`, and `y`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, with the constraint 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, with the constraint 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5).
- `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, with the constraint 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x.

The list of `x` vertices chosen by Bessie contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns the number of ways to choose `y` additional vertices from the remaining vertices of the polygon, such that no two chosen vertices (including Bessie's chosen vertices) are adjacent.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `x`, and `y`, where `n` is the number of sides of a polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and `y` is the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose. It returns the number of ways to choose `y` additional vertices from the remaining vertices such that no two chosen vertices are adjacent.**
