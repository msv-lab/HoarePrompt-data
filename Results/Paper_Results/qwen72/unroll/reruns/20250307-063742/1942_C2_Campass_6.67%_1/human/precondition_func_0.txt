The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, n is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), x is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), and y is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x). The list of x vertices chosen by Bessie contains distinct integers from 1 to n. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
