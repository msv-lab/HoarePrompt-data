The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is assigned the first integer value from the input. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `t` must be non-zero.

State: **The function `R` is defined as a lambda function that maps the input values (split by spaces) to integers. The initial state variables `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and the list of x vertices chosen by Bessie still contains distinct integers from 1 to n. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5. `t` must be non-zero.**
