### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` which represent the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose, respectively.
   - It then reads the `x` vertices chosen by Bessie and stores them in a list `l`.

2. **Sorting and Appending**:
   - The list `l` is sorted to ensure the vertices are in a clockwise order.
   - The first vertex is appended to the end of the list with an offset of `n` to handle the circular nature of the polygon.

3. **Calculating Initial Triangles**:
   - The variable `sx` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of triangles formed.
   - The function iterates through the sorted list `l` and calculates the gaps between consecutive vertices. If a gap is 1, it means a triangle can be formed directly, and `sx` is incremented by 1.

4. **Handling Additional Vertices**:
   - The gaps are stored in the list `val` and sorted based on a custom key. The key sorts the gaps by their parity (even first, then odd) and then by their size.
   - The function then iterates through the sorted gaps and tries to add vertices to form more triangles. If the gap is even, it can be split into two triangles by adding one vertex. If the gap is odd, it can be split into two triangles by adding two vertices.
   - The variable `y` is decremented by the number of vertices added for each gap.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The total number of triangles `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2`. This formula accounts for the initial vertices and the additional triangles formed.
   - The result is clamped to `n - 2` to ensure it does not exceed the maximum possible number of triangles in a polygon with `n` sides.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads and processes the input for multiple test cases.
- **Sorting and Appending**: The vertices are sorted and the circular nature of the polygon is handled correctly by appending the first vertex with an offset.
- **Initial Triangle Calculation**: The initial triangles are correctly identified and counted.
- **Handling Additional Vertices**: The logic for adding vertices to form more triangles is correct. The sorting key ensures that even gaps are handled first, which is optimal for maximizing the number of triangles.
- **Final Calculation**: The formula `x + sx - 2` is correct for calculating the total number of triangles, and the clamping to `n - 2` ensures the result is within the valid range.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
