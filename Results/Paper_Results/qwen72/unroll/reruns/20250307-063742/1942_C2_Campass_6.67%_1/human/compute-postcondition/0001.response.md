Output State: **The function `R` is defined as a lambda function that maps the input values (split by spaces) to integers. The initial state variables `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and the list of x vertices chosen by Bessie still contains distinct integers from 1 to n. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5. `t` is assigned the first integer value from the input.**
