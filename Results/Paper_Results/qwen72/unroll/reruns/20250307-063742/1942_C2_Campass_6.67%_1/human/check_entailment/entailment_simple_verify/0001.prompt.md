You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, n is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), x is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), and y is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x).

    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it processes the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input. The variable `cons` is calculated based on the values in the list `l` and the variables `x` and `y`. After all iterations, the final value of `t` is 0, and the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are the last set of values read from the input. The list `l` and the variable `cons` are reinitialized and recalculated for each iteration, so their final values are based on the last iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` representing the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose.
   - A list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.

3. **Constraints:**
   - \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \)
   - \( 4 \leq n \leq 10^9 \)
   - \( 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) \)
   - \( 0 \leq y \leq n - x \)

4. **Objective:**
   - Maximize the number of triangular pieces by choosing no more than `y` additional vertices.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function `R` is used to read and map input to integers.
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are read.
   - The list of vertices `l` chosen by Bessie is read, sorted, and then the first vertex is appended to the end of the list with an offset of `n` to handle the circular nature of the polygon.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `sx` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of triangular pieces.

3. **Calculating Gaps:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted list of vertices to calculate the gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - If a gap is 1, it means the vertices are adjacent, and a triangle can be formed directly. This is counted in `sx`.
   - The gaps are stored in the list `val`.

4. **Sorting Gaps:**
   - The gaps are sorted based on a custom key: first by whether the gap is even (1 - (gap & 1)), and then by the size of the gap. This ensures that even gaps are considered first, as they can be split into more triangles.

5. **Maximizing Triangles:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted gaps and tries to form triangles by splitting the gaps.
   - For each gap `i`, it calculates the number of triangles that can be formed by splitting the gap into two parts, `i // 2`.
   - If the number of additional vertices `y` is less than the required vertices to split the gap, it adds the maximum possible triangles using the remaining vertices.
   - Otherwise, it adds the triangles formed by the gap and reduces `y` by the number of vertices used.

6. **Final Calculation:**
   - The total number of triangles `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2`.
   - This value is then clamped to the maximum possible number of triangles, which is `n - 2`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Gap Calculation:**
   - The gap calculation `c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` is correct for finding the number of vertices between two chosen vertices.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where the gap is 0 (i.e., consecutive vertices are the same).

2. **Triangle Formation:**
   - The logic for forming triangles from gaps is generally correct, but the handling of even and odd gaps might need a more detailed explanation.
   - The program assumes that even gaps can be split into more triangles, which is true, but it might not always be the optimal way to maximize the number of triangles.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not explicitly handle edge cases where `y` is 0 or `x` is very close to `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to follow the correct logic for solving the problem, but there are a few potential issues and edge cases that might need to be addressed. However, based on the provided problem description and the constraints, the program seems to be mostly correct.

Correctness: **True**
