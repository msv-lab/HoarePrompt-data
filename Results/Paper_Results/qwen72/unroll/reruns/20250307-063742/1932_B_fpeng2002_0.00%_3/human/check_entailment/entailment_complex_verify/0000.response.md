Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0, which is the starting point for the calculations.

3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The key expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is used to determine the next occurrence of the sign after the current year.
   - `start_year + 1` ensures that the next year is considered.
   - `// nums[x]` performs integer division to find the number of complete cycles of the sign that have occurred by the next year.
   - `+ 1` ensures that we move to the next cycle.
   - `* nums[x]` calculates the actual year when the next cycle of the sign will occur.

4. **Sequential Waiting**:
   - The loop iterates through each sign in the list `nums`, updating `start_year` to the next occurrence of the sign.
   - This ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one, as required by the problem description.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the final `start_year` for each test case, which represents the year when the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where all periodicities are 1, which should result in the year `n` (since each sign occurs every year).

7. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case with periodicities `[3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`:
     - First sign: 3 (year 3)
     - Second sign: 4 (year 4)
     - Third sign: 8 (year 8)
     - Fourth sign: 10 (year 10)
     - Fifth sign: 18 (year 18)
     - Sixth sign: 36 (year 36)
   - For the second test case with periodicities `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
     - First sign: 1 (year 1)
     - Second sign: 2 (year 2)
     - Third sign: 3 (year 3)
     - Fourth sign: 4 (year 4)
     - Fifth sign: 5 (year 5)
   - For the third test case with periodicities `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`:
     - First sign: 1 (year 1)
     - Second sign: 2 (year 2)
     - Third sign: 3 (year 3)
     - Fourth sign: 4 (year 4)
     - Fifth sign: 5 (year 5)
   - For the fourth test case with periodicities `[50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`:
     - First sign: 50 (year 50)
     - Second sign: 60 (year 60)
     - Third sign: 1422 (year 1422)
     - Fourth sign: 1600 (year 1600)
     - Fifth sign: 2012 (year 2012)
     - Sixth sign: 2012 (year 2012)

The program's logic and calculations align with the problem description and produce the correct results for the given examples. There are no identified issues or edge cases that would cause the program to fail.

Final: **True**
