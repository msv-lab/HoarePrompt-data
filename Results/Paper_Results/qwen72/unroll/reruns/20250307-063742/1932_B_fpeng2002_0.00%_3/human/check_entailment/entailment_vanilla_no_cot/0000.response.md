Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. It reads the number of test cases, `num_tests`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of signs, `n`.
   - It reads the periodicities of the signs, `nums`.
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year when the first sign is expected to occur.
   - It iterates through each sign's periodicity and calculates the next occurrence year for each sign, ensuring that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
   - The formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that the next sign occurs in the smallest year greater than `start_year` that is a multiple of `nums[x]`.
   - Finally, it prints the year when the last sign occurs, which is the year the apocalypse will happen.

The program correctly handles the constraints and the sequential nature of the signs, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. Therefore, the program is correct.
