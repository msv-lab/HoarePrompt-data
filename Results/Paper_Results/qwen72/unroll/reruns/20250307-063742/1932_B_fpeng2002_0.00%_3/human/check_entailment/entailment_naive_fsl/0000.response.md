Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen according to the problem description. The logic of the program ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one, and it correctly handles the sequential waiting period for each sign. The use of `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is after the current year, and the program correctly iterates through all the signs for each test case. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the program to fail.
