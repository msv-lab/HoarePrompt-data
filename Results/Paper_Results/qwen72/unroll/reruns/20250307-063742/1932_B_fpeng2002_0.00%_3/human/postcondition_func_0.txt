The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input, representing the periodicities of certain signs. The function calculates the first year in which all signs align according to their periodicities and prints this year for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that `num_tests` is 0. The function does not return any value.
