The code snippet `num_tests = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `num_tests`. The input is expected to be an integer between 1 and 1000, as specified in the initial state. The list of lists containing the periodicities of the signs is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, and the list of lists containing the periodicities of the signs remains unchanged.**
