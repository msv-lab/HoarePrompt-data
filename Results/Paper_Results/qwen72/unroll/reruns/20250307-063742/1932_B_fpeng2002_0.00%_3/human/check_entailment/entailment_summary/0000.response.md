Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign occurs, which is the year of the apocalypse according to the Chaya tribe's beliefs. The key part of the program is the loop that calculates the year in which each sign occurs, starting from the first sign and ensuring that each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year before the first sign occurs.
2. **Loop through signs**: For each sign, the program calculates the next year in which the sign will occur. This is done using the formula:
   ```python
   start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
   ```
   - `start_year + 1` ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the current year.
   - `// nums[x]` finds the number of complete cycles of the current sign that have occurred up to the year `start_year + 1`.
   - `+ 1` ensures that we move to the next cycle.
   - `* nums[x]` calculates the exact year when the next cycle of the current sign will occur.

This formula ensures that each sign occurs in the correct sequence and strictly after the previous sign has occurred. The program then prints the final `start_year` for each test case, which is the year when the n-th sign occurs.

Let's verify the correctness with the example provided:
- For the input `3 2 4 5 9 18`:
  - First sign: `start_year = 0` → `3` (since 3 is the first multiple of 3)
  - Second sign: `start_year = 3` → `4` (since 4 is the first multiple of 2 after 3)
  - Third sign: `start_year = 4` → `8` (since 8 is the first multiple of 4 after 4)
  - Fourth sign: `start_year = 8` → `10` (since 10 is the first multiple of 5 after 8)
  - Fifth sign: `start_year = 10` → `18` (since 18 is the first multiple of 9 after 10)
  - Sixth sign: `start_year = 18` → `36` (since 36 is the first multiple of 18 after 18)

The program correctly calculates the year for each test case based on the given input and the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
