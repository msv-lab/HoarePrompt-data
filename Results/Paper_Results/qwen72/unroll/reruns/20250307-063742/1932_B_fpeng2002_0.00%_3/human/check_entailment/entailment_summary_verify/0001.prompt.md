You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input, representing the periodicities of certain signs. The function calculates the first year in which all signs align according to their periodicities and prints this year for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that `num_tests` is 0. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and the implementation step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains the number of test cases \( t \).
   - Each test case has:
     - The number of signs \( n \).
     - A list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) representing the periodicities of the signs.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the year in which the \( n \)-th sign will occur, which is the year when all signs will have occurred sequentially.

3. **Logic:**
   - The signs occur at multiples of their periodicities.
   - The \( i \)-th sign must occur strictly after the \( (i-1) \)-th sign.
   - We need to find the smallest year in which the \( n \)-th sign occurs, given that the previous signs have already occurred in the correct sequence.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs \( n \) and the list of periodicities \( nums \).

2. **Calculating the Year:**
   - The program initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign \( x \) in the list \( nums \), it updates `start_year` to the next multiple of \( nums[x] \) that is greater than `start_year`.

3. **Key Calculation:**
   - The expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is used to find the next multiple of \( nums[x] \) that is greater than `start_year`.
   - `start_year + 1` ensures that the next year is considered.
   - `// nums[x]` finds the quotient when `start_year + 1` is divided by \( nums[x] \).
   - `+ 1` ensures that we move to the next multiple.
   - `* nums[x]` calculates the actual year of the next occurrence.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `start_year`.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- \( n = 6 \)
- \( nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18] \)

1. **First Sign:**
   - `start_year = 0`
   - Next multiple of 3 greater than 0: \( 3 \)
   - `start_year = 3`

2. **Second Sign:**
   - `start_year = 3`
   - Next multiple of 2 greater than 3: \( 4 \)
   - `start_year = 4`

3. **Third Sign:**
   - `start_year = 4`
   - Next multiple of 4 greater than 4: \( 8 \)
   - `start_year = 8`

4. **Fourth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 8`
   - Next multiple of 5 greater than 8: \( 10 \)
   - `start_year = 10`

5. **Fifth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 10`
   - Next multiple of 9 greater than 10: \( 18 \)
   - `start_year = 18`

6. **Sixth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 18`
   - Next multiple of 18 greater than 18: \( 36 \)
   - `start_year = 36`

The program correctly outputs 36 for this test case.

#### Test Case 2:
- \( n = 5 \)
- \( nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \)

1. **First Sign:**
   - `start_year = 0`

   - `start_year = 1`

2. **Second Sign:**
   - `start_year = 1`
   - Next multiple of 2 greater than 1: \( 2 \)
   - `start_year = 2`

3. **Third Sign:**
   - `start_year = 2`
   - Next multiple of 3 greater than 2: \( 3 \)
   - `start_year = 3`

4. **Fourth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 3`
   - Next multiple of 4 greater than 3: \( 4 \)
   - `start_year = 4`

5. **Fifth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 4`
   - Next multiple of 5 greater than 4: \( 5 \)
   - `start_year = 5`

The program correctly outputs 5 for this test case.

#### Test Case 3:
- \( n = 5 \)
- \( nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] \)

2. **Second Sign:**
   - `start_year = 1`
   - Next multiple of 1 greater than 1: \( 2 \)
   - `start_year = 2`

3. **Third Sign:**
   - `start_year = 2`
   - Next multiple of 1 greater than 2: \( 3 \)
   - `start_year = 3`

4. **Fourth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 3`
   - Next multiple of 1 greater than 3: \( 4 \)
   - `start_year = 4`

5. **Fifth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 4`
   - Next multiple of 1 greater than 4: \( 5 \)
   - `start_year = 5`

The program correctly outputs 5 for this test case.

#### Test Case 4:
- \( n = 6 \)
- \( nums = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006] \)

1. **First Sign:**
   - `start_year = 0`
   - Next multiple of 50 greater than 0: \( 50 \)
   - `start_year = 50`

2. **Second Sign:**
   - `start_year = 50`
   - Next multiple of 30 greater than 50: \( 60 \)
   - `start_year = 60`

3. **Third Sign:**
   - `start_year = 60`
   - Next multiple of 711 greater than 60: \( 711 \)
   - `start_year = 711`

4. **Fourth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 711`
   - Next multiple of 200 greater than 711: \( 800 \)
   - `start_year = 800`

5. **Fifth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 800`
   - Next multiple of 503 greater than 800: \( 1006 \)
   - `start_year = 1006`

6. **Sixth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 1006`
   - Next multiple of 1006 greater than 1006: \( 2012 \)
   - `start_year = 2012`

The program correctly outputs 2012 for this test case.
