Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, and the loop has printed the value of `start_year` for each iteration, which represents the first year in which all signs in the list `nums` align according to their periodicities.**

### Explanation:
- **`num_tests`**: This variable starts with an initial value and decreases by 1 in each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `num_tests` will be 0.
- **`start_year`**: For each test case, the variable `start_year` is calculated to find the first year in which all signs in the list `nums` align based on their periodicities. The loop prints this value for each test case.
- **Other Variables**: The list `nums` and the integer `n` are re-assigned in each iteration, but their values are not carried over to the next iteration. The list of lists containing the periodicities of the signs remains unchanged as specified in the initial state.
