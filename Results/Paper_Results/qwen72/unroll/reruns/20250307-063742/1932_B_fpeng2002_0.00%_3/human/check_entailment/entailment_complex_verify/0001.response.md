Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly follows the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the number of test cases and processes each one by reading the number of signs and their periodicities. The key calculation `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that the program finds the next multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is strictly greater than the current `start_year`. This aligns with the requirement that each sign must occur strictly after the previous one. The program correctly handles the examples provided and produces the expected output for each test case.

The annotated version of the code also confirms that the state of the program is managed correctly throughout the execution. The loop ensures that `num_tests` is decremented to 0, and the final `start_year` is printed for each test case, which represents the year when the \( n \)-th sign occurs.

Final: **True**
