### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and then processing each test case one by one. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the list of periodicities (`nums`).

2. **Initialization**: The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0, which is appropriate because we are starting from year 0.

3. **Loop for Calculating the Year**:
   - The loop iterates over each periodicity in the list `nums`.
   - The expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is used to find the next year in which the current sign will occur, strictly after the previous sign.
   - `start_year + 1` ensures that we start looking for the next sign after the year in which the previous sign occurred.
   - `// nums[x]` performs integer division to find the number of complete cycles of the current periodicity that have passed by the year `start_year + 1`.
   - `+ 1` ensures that we move to the next cycle.
   - `* nums[x]` calculates the year in which the next cycle of the current periodicity will occur.

4. **Output**: The function prints the calculated `start_year` for each test case, which is the year in which the last sign (the n-th sign) occurs.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where all periodicities are 1, as shown in the third test case.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the periodicities are different and require more complex calculations, as shown in the first and fourth test cases.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It accurately calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur, taking into account the sequential nature of the signs and their periodicities.

### Correctness:
**True**
