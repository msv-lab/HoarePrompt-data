The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000. Since `num_tests` is already within a range that ensures it is greater than 0, no adjustment is needed.

State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, and the list of lists containing the periodicities of the signs remains unchanged**
