The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `periods`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. `periods` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the periodicities of the signs, and each integer in the inner list is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive).

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities in the inner list and returns this value.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `periods`. It returns a list of the least common multiples (LCMs) of the periodicities for each test case.**
