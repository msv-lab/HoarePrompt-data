Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the periodicities of the signs (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).**

However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters. To correctly implement the solution, the function should be defined as:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the periodicities of the signs for a specific test case.
