To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and the implementation step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains the number of test cases \( t \).
   - Each test case has:
     - The number of signs \( n \).
     - A list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) representing the periodicities of the signs.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the year in which the \( n \)-th sign will occur, which is the year when all signs will have occurred sequentially.

3. **Logic:**
   - The signs occur at multiples of their periodicities.
   - The \( i \)-th sign must occur strictly after the \( (i-1) \)-th sign.
   - We need to find the smallest year in which the \( n \)-th sign occurs, given that the previous signs have already occurred in the correct sequence.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs \( n \) and the list of periodicities \( nums \).

2. **Calculating the Year:**
   - The program initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign \( x \) in the list \( nums \), it updates `start_year` to the next multiple of \( nums[x] \) that is greater than `start_year`.

3. **Key Calculation:**
   - The expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is used to find the next multiple of \( nums[x] \) that is greater than `start_year`.
   - `start_year + 1` ensures that the next year is considered.
   - `// nums[x]` finds the quotient when `start_year + 1` is divided by \( nums[x] \).
   - `+ 1` ensures that we move to the next multiple.
   - `* nums[x]` calculates the actual year of the next occurrence.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `start_year`.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- \( n = 6 \)
- \( nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18] \)

1. **First Sign:**
   - `start_year = 0`
   - Next multiple of 3 greater than 0: \( 3 \)
   - `start_year = 3`

2. **Second Sign:**
   - `start_year = 3`
   - Next multiple of 2 greater than 3: \( 4 \)
   - `start_year = 4`

3. **Third Sign:**
   - `start_year = 4`
   - Next multiple of 4 greater than 4: \( 8 \)
   - `start_year = 8`

4. **Fourth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 8`
   - Next multiple of 5 greater than 8: \( 10 \)
   - `start_year = 10`

5. **Fifth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 10`
   - Next multiple of 9 greater than 10: \( 18 \)
   - `start_year = 18`

6. **Sixth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 18`
   - Next multiple of 18 greater than 18: \( 36 \)
   - `start_year = 36`

The program correctly outputs 36 for this test case.

#### Test Case 2:
- \( n = 5 \)
- \( nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \)

1. **First Sign:**
   - `start_year = 0`
   - Next multiple of 1 greater than 0: \( 1 \)
   - `start_year = 1`

2. **Second Sign:**
   - `start_year = 1`
   - Next multiple of 2 greater than 1: \( 2 \)
   - `start_year = 2`

3. **Third Sign:**
   - `start_year = 2`
   - Next multiple of 3 greater than 2: \( 3 \)
   - `start_year = 3`

4. **Fourth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 3`
   - Next multiple of 4 greater than 3: \( 4 \)
   - `start_year = 4`

5. **Fifth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 4`
   - Next multiple of 5 greater than 4: \( 5 \)
   - `start_year = 5`

The program correctly outputs 5 for this test case.

#### Test Case 3:
- \( n = 5 \)
- \( nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] \)

1. **First Sign:**
   - `start_year = 0`
   - Next multiple of 1 greater than 0: \( 1 \)
   - `start_year = 1`

2. **Second Sign:**
   - `start_year = 1`
   - Next multiple of 1 greater than 1: \( 2 \)
   - `start_year = 2`

3. **Third Sign:**
   - `start_year = 2`
   - Next multiple of 1 greater than 2: \( 3 \)
   - `start_year = 3`

4. **Fourth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 3`
   - Next multiple of 1 greater than 3: \( 4 \)
   - `start_year = 4`

5. **Fifth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 4`
   - Next multiple of 1 greater than 4: \( 5 \)
   - `start_year = 5`

The program correctly outputs 5 for this test case.

#### Test Case 4:
- \( n = 6 \)
- \( nums = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006] \)

1. **First Sign:**
   - `start_year = 0`
   - Next multiple of 50 greater than 0: \( 50 \)
   - `start_year = 50`

2. **Second Sign:**
   - `start_year = 50`
   - Next multiple of 30 greater than 50: \( 60 \)
   - `start_year = 60`

3. **Third Sign:**
   - `start_year = 60`
   - Next multiple of 711 greater than 60: \( 711 \)
   - `start_year = 711`

4. **Fourth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 711`
   - Next multiple of 200 greater than 711: \( 800 \)
   - `start_year = 800`

5. **Fifth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 800`
   - Next multiple of 503 greater than 800: \( 1006 \)
   - `start_year = 1006`

6. **Sixth Sign:**
   - `start_year = 1006`
   - Next multiple of 1006 greater than 1006: \( 2012 \)
   - `start_year = 2012`

The program correctly outputs 2012 for this test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the \( n \)-th sign will occur, given the constraints and the problem description. It handles all the provided test cases correctly.
