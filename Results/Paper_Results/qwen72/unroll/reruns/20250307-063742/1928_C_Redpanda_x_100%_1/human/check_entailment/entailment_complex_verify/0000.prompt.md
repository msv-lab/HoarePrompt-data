You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:

    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:

    #State: *`factors` is a dictionary containing the prime factorization of `n`. If `nn` > 1, the key `nn` in `factors` is incremented by 1, and `nn` is set to 1. `i` remains the smallest integer greater than the square root of the original `n`.
    primes = list(factors.keys())
    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor
        
    #State: The loop does not modify the variables `factors`, `nn`, `i`, or `primes`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state: `factors` is a dictionary containing the prime factorization of `n`. If `nn` > 1, the key `nn` in `factors` is incremented by 1, and `nn` is set to 1. `i` remains the smallest integer greater than the square root of the original `n`. `primes` is a list of the keys (prime factors) from the `factors` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` such that 1 < n <= 10^9 and returns a generator that yields the prime factors of `n` along with their respective powers. The function computes the prime factorization of `n` and stores it in a dictionary `factors` where the keys are the prime factors and the values are their powers. The function then generates and yields each prime factor and its power one by one. After the function concludes, the dictionary `factors` contains the complete prime factorization of `n`, `nn` is set to 1, and `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of the original `n`. The list `primes` contains the keys (prime factors) from the `factors` dictionary.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where `primes` is a list of prime numbers.

        yield 1
    else :
        rest = generate(k + 1)

                yield factor * prime_to_i
                prime_to_i *= prime
            
        #State: `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)`, `prime` is the k-th prime number in the `primes` list, and all possible products of `factor` and powers of `prime` (from `prime`^0 to `prime`^`factors[prime]`) have been yielded for each `factor` in `rest`.
    #State: *`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where `primes` is a list of prime numbers. If `k` is equal to the length of the `primes` list, the value 1 has been yielded. Otherwise, if 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)`, `prime` is the k-th prime number in the `primes` list, and all possible products of `factor` and powers of `prime` (from `prime`^0 to `prime`^`factors[prime]`) have been yielded for each `factor` in `rest`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `generate(k)` is a generator that yields all possible products of the first `k` primes from a given list `primes`, raised to the powers specified in the dictionary `factors`. If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, it yields 1. Otherwise, it recursively generates products by combining each factor from the result of `generate(k + 1)` with all powers of the `k`-th prime number in `primes` (from `prime`^0 to `prime`^`factors[prime]`). The final state of the program is that all such products have been yielded.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `generate` are not designed to solve the problem of determining how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position and number.

### Issues:
1. **Function Purpose Mismatch**: The function `func_1` appears to be a prime factorization function, which is not directly relevant to the problem of determining the number of valid \( k \) values for Vasya's position and number.
2. **Missing Main Logic**: The main logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values is missing. The problem requires a specific algorithm to check the constraints and count the valid \( k \) values, which is not implemented in the provided code.
3. **Incorrect Output**: The program does not produce the required output format. The problem requires an integer output for each test case, but the provided code does not handle test cases and does not return the correct count of valid \( k \) values.

### Example Case:
For the input \( n = 10 \) and \( x = 2 \), the program should output 4 (as \( k = 2, 3, 5, 6 \) are suitable). However, the provided code does not handle this input correctly and does not produce the expected output.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
