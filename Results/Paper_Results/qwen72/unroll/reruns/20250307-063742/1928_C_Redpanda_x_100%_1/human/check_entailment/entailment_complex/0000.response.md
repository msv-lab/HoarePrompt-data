### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, with the first \( k \) positions being \( 1, 2, \ldots, k \) and the next \( k - 2 \) positions being \( k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 \).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(n)`**:
     - This function computes the prime factorization of \( n \) and stores it in a dictionary `factors`.
     - It then generates and yields all divisors of \( n \) using the `generate` function.
     - The function is correct in its prime factorization and divisor generation logic.

   - **`generate(k)`**:
     - This is a recursive generator function that yields all possible products of the first \( k \) primes from the `primes` list, raised to the powers specified in the `factors` dictionary.
     - The function correctly handles the base case (when \( k \) equals the length of `primes`, it yields 1) and the recursive case (combining each factor from the result of `generate(k + 1)` with all powers of the \( k \)-th prime).

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program calculates two sets of possible \( k \) values:
     - `ans` is the set of \( k \) values where \( k \) is a divisor of \( n - x \) and \( k \) is even and \( k / 2 + 1 \geq x \).
     - `ans2` is the set of \( k \) values where \( k \) is a divisor of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( k \) is even and \( k / 2 + 1 \geq x \).
   - The program then takes the union of these two sets and prints the length of the union, which gives the number of different \( k \) values that fit the constraints.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints \( 1 \leq t \leq 100 \), \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \), and \( k > 1 \).
   - The program ensures that \( k \) is even and \( k / 2 + 1 \geq x \), which is necessary for the settling pattern to work correctly.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The prime factorization and divisor generation logic in `func_1` and `generate` are correct.
   - The main program logic correctly identifies and counts the valid \( k \) values for each test case.
   - The program handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
