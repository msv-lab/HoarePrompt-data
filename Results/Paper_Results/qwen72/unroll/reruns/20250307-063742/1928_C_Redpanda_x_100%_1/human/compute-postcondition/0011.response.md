The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer with the constraint that 1 < n <= 10^9. The function returns a value based on the input `n`, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` within the specified range and return a value based on `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` such that 1 < n <= 10^9 and returns a value based on `n`.**
