Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` such that 1 < n <= 10^9 and returns a generator that yields the prime factors of `n` along with their respective powers. The function computes the prime factorization of `n` and stores it in a dictionary `factors` where the keys are the prime factors and the values are their powers. The function then generates and yields each prime factor and its power one by one. After the function concludes, the dictionary `factors` contains the complete prime factorization of `n`, `nn` is set to 1, and `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of the original `n`. The list `primes` contains the keys (prime factors) from the `factors` dictionary. **
