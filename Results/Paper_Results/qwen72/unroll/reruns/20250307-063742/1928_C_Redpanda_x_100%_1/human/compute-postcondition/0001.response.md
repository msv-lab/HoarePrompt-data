The code snippet `yield 1` is part of a generator function. When this line is executed, it yields the value 1 and pauses the function's execution, saving the state for the next call. The variables `k` and `primes` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where `primes` is a list of prime numbers, and the current value of `k` is equal to the length of the `primes` list. The value 1 has been yielded.**
