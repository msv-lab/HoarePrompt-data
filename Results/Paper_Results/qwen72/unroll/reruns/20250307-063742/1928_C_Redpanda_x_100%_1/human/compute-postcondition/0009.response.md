Functionality: ** The function `generate(k)` is a generator that yields all possible products of the first `k` primes from a given list `primes`, raised to the powers specified in the dictionary `factors`. If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, it yields 1. Otherwise, it recursively generates products by combining each factor from the result of `generate(k + 1)` with all powers of the `k`-th prime number in `primes` (from `prime`^0 to `prime`^`factors[prime]`). The final state of the program is that all such products have been yielded. **
