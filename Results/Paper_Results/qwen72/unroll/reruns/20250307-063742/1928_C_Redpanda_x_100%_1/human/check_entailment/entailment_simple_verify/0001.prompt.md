You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Problem Description**: Vasya is given a position `n` and a number `x` he received during the settling. We need to determine how many different values of `k` (where `k > 1`) fit the given constraints.
2. **Settling Pattern**:
   - The first `k` positions are numbered 1 to `k`.
   - The next `k-2` positions are numbered `k-1` to 2.
   - This pattern repeats every `2k-2` positions.
3. **Constraints**:
   - `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`
   - `k > 1`

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `generate`.

#### Function 1: `func_1(n)`
- **Purpose**: This function is supposed to find the factors of `n` and then generate all possible factors of `n` using a recursive generator function `generate`.
- **Steps**:
  1. Initialize an empty dictionary `factors` to store the prime factors of `n` and their counts.
  2. Use a while loop to find the prime factors of `n` and store them in the `factors` dictionary.
  3. Convert the keys of the `factors` dictionary to a list `primes`.
  4. Call the `generate` function starting from index 0 and yield the results.

#### Function 2: `generate(k)`
- **Purpose**: This function is a recursive generator that generates all possible factors of `n` by combining the prime factors.
- **Steps**:
  1. If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, yield 1 (base case).
  2. Otherwise, recursively call `generate` for the next index `k + 1`.
  3. For each factor generated by the recursive call, multiply it by the current prime raised to different powers and yield the results.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Global Variables**: The `primes` and `factors` variables are used in `func_1` and `generate` but are not defined in the global scope. This will cause a `NameError` when `generate` is called.
2. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is not designed to solve the problem as described. It is supposed to find the number of valid `k` values, but it only generates factors of `n` and does not check the settling pattern.
3. **Recursive Generator**: The `generate` function is a recursive generator that generates all possible factors of `n`, but it does not filter these factors to check if they fit the settling pattern.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem, we need to:
1. Determine the possible values of `k` that fit the settling pattern.
2. Check if the given `x` can be a valid number in the settling pattern for each possible `k`.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def count_valid_ks(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        if (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) == 0:
            position = (n - 1) // (2 * k - 2) * (2 * k - 2) + 1
            if position <= n:
                if (position <= x <= position + k - 1) or (position + k - 2 <= x <= position + 2 * k - 3):
                    count += 1
    return count

def solve(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, x in test_cases:
        results.append(count_valid_ks(n, x))
    return results

# Example usage:
t = 5
test_cases = [
    (10, 2),
    (3, 1),
    (76, 4),
    (100, 99),
    (1000000000, 500000000)
]

results = solve(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function `count_valid_ks(n, x)`**:
   - Iterate over possible values of `k` from 2 to `n`.
   - Check if `(n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) == 0` to see if `n` fits the repeating pattern.
   - Calculate the position in the line where the pattern starts.
   - Check if `x` is a valid number in the settling pattern for the given `k`.
   - Increment the count if `x` is valid.

2. **Function `solve(t, test_cases)`**:
   - Iterate over each test case and call `count_valid_ks` for each pair `(n, x)`.
   - Store the results in a list and return the list.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It lacks the necessary logic to check the settling pattern and count valid `k` values.
