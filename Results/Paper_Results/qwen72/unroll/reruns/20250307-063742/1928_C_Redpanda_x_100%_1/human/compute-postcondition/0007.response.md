Postcondition: ***`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where `primes` is a list of prime numbers. If `k` is equal to the length of the `primes` list, the value 1 has been yielded. Otherwise, if 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)`, `prime` is the k-th prime number in the `primes` list, and all possible products of `factor` and powers of `prime` (from `prime`^0 to `prime`^`factors[prime]`) have been yielded for each `factor` in `rest`.***
