t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each test case contains n (2 <= n <= 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order; m is an integer (1 <= m <= 10^5) representing the number of queries; each query is a pair of integers (x_i, y_i) where 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i â‰  y_i; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
