The function `func` accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing the positions of the cities.
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries.
- `queries` is a list of `m` tuples (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the pairs of cities for which the closest city needs to be determined.

The function returns a list of results for each query, where each result is the index of the closest city to the city at index `x_i` or `y_i` in the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (number of cities), `a` (list of city positions), and `m` (number of queries). It returns a list of results for each query, where each result is the index of the closest city to the city at index `x_i` or `y_i` in the list `a`.**
