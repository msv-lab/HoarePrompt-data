Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and queries is a list of m tuples (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is unique. `r` is a function that maps input to integers.**

Explanation:
- The code `t, = r()` updates the value of `t` by calling the function `r` and unpacking its return value.
- The function `r` is assumed to return a single integer, which is then assigned to `t`.
- The value of `t` is now an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, as specified in the initial state.
- The other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, and `queries`) remain unchanged and retain their initial properties and constraints.
