The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of vertices in a tree), `k` (the number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and performs a binary search to find the smallest value `l` such that a hypothetical `check` function returns `True`. The function prints `l - 1` and does not return any value. The input parameters `n`, `k`, and `edges` remain unchanged after the function execution.
