### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number `x` such that after removing exactly `k` edges from a tree, each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a tree and a number `k`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Input Parameters:**
     - `n`: Number of vertices in the tree.
     - `k`: Number of edges to remove.
     - `edges`: List of tuples representing the edges of the tree.
   - **Function Steps:**
     - Constructs an adjacency list `g` from the `edges`.
     - Initializes variables `c`, `l`, and `r` for binary search.
     - Performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that `check(mid)` returns `True`.
     - Prints `r` (which is `l - 1` when the loop terminates).

3. **Function `check` Analysis:**
   - **Input Parameters:**
     - `A`: A positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component.
   - **Function Steps:**
     - Uses a stack to perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the root node (node 1).
     - Tracks the size of each subtree using a dictionary `d`.
     - Counts the number of nodes (`r`) whose subtree size is at least `A`.
     - Returns `True` if the number of such nodes is greater than `k` or if the root node has a subtree size of at least `A` and the count of such nodes is exactly `k`.
     - Returns `False` otherwise.

4. **Binary Search in `func_1`:**
   - The binary search is used to find the maximum `x` such that `check(x)` returns `True`.
   - The search range is from `1` to `n // k`, which is a reasonable upper bound because if `x` is greater than `n // k`, it would be impossible to have `k` components each of size at least `x`.

5. **DFS in `check`:**
   - The DFS is used to explore the tree and count the number of nodes whose subtree size is at least `A`.
   - The function correctly handles the tree structure and ensures that the root node is considered as a special case.
   - The function also correctly updates the sizes of the subtrees and the count of nodes meeting the condition.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 1 and the tree is a simple path (e.g., the second test case).
   - The program handles the case where the tree is more complex and has multiple branches (e.g., the first and third test cases).

7. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The binary search in `func_1` is correctly implemented to find the maximum `x`.
   - The DFS in `check` correctly counts the number of nodes whose subtree size is at least `A`.
   - The conditions in `check` are correctly set to ensure that the number of components meeting the size requirement is exactly `k`.
