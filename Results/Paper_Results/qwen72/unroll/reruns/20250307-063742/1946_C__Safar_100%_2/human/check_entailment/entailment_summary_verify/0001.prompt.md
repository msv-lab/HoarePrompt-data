You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)
    c = 0

    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    print(r)

#Function 2:
def check(A):
    stack = [(1, 1)]
    visited = set()
    d = {1: 1}
    r = 0
    while True:
        (x, p) = stack[-1]
        if x not in visited:
            visited.add(x)
            d[x] = 1
            for node in g[x]:
                if node != p:
                    stack.append((node, x))
        else:
            if x == 1:
                break
            if d[x] >= A:
                r += 1
            else:
                d[p] += d[x]
            stack.pop()
            visited.remove(x)
            del d[x]
    if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k):
        return True
    return False



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `check` accepts a positive integer `A` and a global dictionary `g` representing the adjacency list of a tree. It returns `True` if the number of nodes in the tree that have a degree (number of children) greater than or equal to `A` is greater than `k` or if the root node (node 1) has a degree greater than or equal to `A` and the count of such nodes is exactly `k`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. After the function concludes, `r` is the count of nodes with a degree greater than or equal to `A`, and the `visited`, `d`, and `stack` variables are empty.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a tree with `n` vertices and need to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The goal is to find the maximum value of `x` that satisfies this condition.

2. **Binary Search Approach**:
   - The program uses a binary search to find the maximum `x`. This is a good approach because the problem can be framed as a decision problem: for a given `x`, can we remove `k` edges to ensure each component has at least `x` vertices?
   - The binary search range is from `1` to `n // k`, which is a reasonable upper bound because if we remove `k` edges, we can have at most `k + 1` components, and each component must have at least `x` vertices.

3. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list `g` where `g[i]` contains the neighbors of vertex `i`.
   - This is a standard and efficient way to represent a graph in Python.

4. **Check Function**:
   - The `check` function is used to determine if it is possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The function uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach with a stack to traverse the tree.
   - It keeps track of the size of each component using a dictionary `d` and a set `visited` to mark visited nodes.
   - When a node is visited, its size is set to 1. If a node's size is at least `x`, it is counted as a valid component.
   - If the total number of valid components `r` is greater than `k` or if the root component has at least `x` vertices and `r` is exactly `k`, the function returns `True`.

5. **DFS Implementation**:
   - The DFS is implemented using a stack to avoid recursion limits.
   - The stack stores tuples `(node, parent)` to keep track of the current node and its parent.
   - The function correctly handles the traversal and size calculation of each component.

6. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search updates the range based on the result of the `check` function.
   - If `check(mid)` returns `True`, it means `mid` is a valid `x`, so the search range is updated to `l = mid + 1`.
   - If `check(mid)` returns `False`, the search range is updated to `r = mid - 1`.
   - The final result is `r`, which is the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 1 and `n` is 2 correctly, as shown in the example.
   - The program also handles larger trees and multiple test cases as required by the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality. The binary search and DFS are well-structured and handle the constraints and edge cases appropriately.
