### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases, each with a tree defined by `n` vertices and `k` edges to be removed.
   - It constructs the adjacency list `g` for each tree using the provided edges.

2. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a binary search to find the maximum value `x` such that each remaining connected component after removing `k` edges has at least `x` vertices.
   - The binary search range is from `1` to `n // k`, which is a reasonable upper bound because the maximum size of each component cannot be more than `n // k` if `k` edges are removed.

3. **Check Function**:
   - The `check` function is used to determine if a given `A` (which is the current midpoint in the binary search) can be the minimum size of each component after removing `k` edges.
   - It performs a depth-first search (DFS) to count the number of nodes that can form components of size at least `A`.
   - The function maintains a stack to simulate the DFS, a set `visited` to keep track of visited nodes, and a dictionary `d` to store the size of each subtree.
   - If a node's subtree size is at least `A`, it increments the count `r`.
   - If the root node's subtree size is at least `A` and the count `r` is exactly `k`, or if `r` is greater than `k`, the function returns `True`.

4. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search in `func_1` adjusts the range based on the result of `check(mid)`.
   - If `check(mid)` returns `True`, it means `mid` is a valid size, so the search range is adjusted to `l = mid + 1`.
   - If `check(mid)` returns `False`, it means `mid` is too large, so the search range is adjusted to `r = mid - 1`.
   - The final result is `r`, which is the maximum valid size found by the binary search.

5. **Edge Removal and Component Size**:
   - The `check` function ensures that the number of components of size at least `A` is at least `k` or more.
   - The logic in `check` correctly handles the edge removal by simulating the DFS and counting the valid components.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum value `x` for each test case, which is the result of the binary search.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`. The binary search and DFS logic are sound and handle the problem constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
