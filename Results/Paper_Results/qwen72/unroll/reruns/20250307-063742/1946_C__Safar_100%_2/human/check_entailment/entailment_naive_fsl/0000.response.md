Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the tree is a star graph (a tree where one vertex is connected to all other vertices, and the other vertices have no additional connections). In such a case, the `check` function might incorrectly return `True` for a value of `A` that is too large, leading to an incorrect result.

Consider the following input:
```
1
5 1
1 2
1 3
1 4
1 5
```
For this input, the tree is a star graph with vertex 1 at the center. The correct answer should be 2, because removing any one of the edges from vertex 1 will result in two components, each with at least 2 vertices. However, the `check` function might incorrectly return `True` for a larger value of `A`, leading to an incorrect result.
