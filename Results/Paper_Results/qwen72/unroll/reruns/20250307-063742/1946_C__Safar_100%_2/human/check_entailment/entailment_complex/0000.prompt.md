Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

# Annotated Functions:
q = []
for i in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    edges = []
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split(' '))
        edges.append((a, b))
    func_1(n, k, edges)
for (n, k, edges) in q:
    func_1(n, k, edges)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 <= a, b <= n.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: g is a list of n + 1 lists where each list at index i contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex i by an edge. The lengths of these lists represent the number of edges connected to each vertex. The variables n and k remain unchanged, and the edges list remains the same as in the initial state.
    c = 0
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: l is the smallest value such that check(l) would return True, and r is l - 1.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: l - 1 (where l is the smallest value such that check(l) returns True)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of vertices in a tree), `k` (the number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and performs a binary search to find the smallest value `l` such that a hypothetical `check` function returns `True`. The function prints `l - 1` and does not return any value. The input parameters `n`, `k`, and `edges` remain unchanged after the function execution.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, and k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree.
def check(A):
    stack = [(1, 1)]
    visited = set()
    d = {(1): 1}
    r = 0
    while True:
        x, p = stack[-1]
        
        if x not in visited:

            d[x] = 1

                if node != p:
                    stack.append((node, x))
        else:
            if x == 1:
                break
            if d[x] >= A:
                r += 1
            else:
                d[p] += d[x]
            stack.pop()
            visited.remove(x)
            del d[x]
        
    #State: The loop terminates with `r` being the count of nodes in the tree that have a degree (number of children) greater than or equal to `A`, `visited` and `d` are empty, and `stack` is empty.
    if (r > k or d[1] >= A and r == k) :
        return True
        #The program returns True.
    #State: The loop terminates with `r` being the count of nodes in the tree that have a degree (number of children) greater than or equal to `A`, `visited` and `d` are empty, and `stack` is empty. Additionally, `r` is less than or equal to `k` and either `d[1]` is less than `A` or `r` is not equal to `k`.
    return False
    #The program returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `check` accepts a positive integer `A` and a global dictionary `g` representing the adjacency list of a tree. It returns `True` if the number of nodes in the tree that have a degree (number of children) greater than or equal to `A` is greater than `k` or if the root node (node 1) has a degree greater than or equal to `A` and the count of such nodes is exactly `k`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. After the function concludes, `r` is the count of nodes with a degree greater than or equal to `A`, and the `visited`, `d`, and `stack` variables are empty.
