The function `check` accepts a parameter `A`. `A` is a positive integer. The function returns `True` or `False` based on some internal logic that is not specified in the given constraints. However, given the constraints and the output cases, we can infer that the function is designed to evaluate a condition related to the parameter `A` and return a boolean value accordingly.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `A` and returns `True` if a certain condition is met; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
