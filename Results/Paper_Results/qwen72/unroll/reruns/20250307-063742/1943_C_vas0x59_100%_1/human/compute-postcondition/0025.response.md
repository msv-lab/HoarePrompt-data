Postcondition: ***The `path_ba` list contains the shortest path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order, starting from `b` and ending at `a`. The variable `n` is the last node in this path before `a`. The `ops` list is populated based on the length of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples where the first element is the middle node `c` of `path_ba` and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` (inclusive). If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2, up to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`. The values of `path_ba`, `n`, `ci`, `ci1`, `ci2`, `c1`, and `c2` remain unchanged.***
