The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the expression `n - 1`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, inclusive, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2000, inclusive; `u2vs` is a list containing `n` empty lists**
