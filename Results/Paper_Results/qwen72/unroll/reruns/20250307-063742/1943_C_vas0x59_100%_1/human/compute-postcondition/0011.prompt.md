Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, inclusive; `u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where each list contains integers representing the indices of other lists that are connected to it; `d` is the distance from the starting node (index 0) to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function using `a` as the starting node; `previous` is a list containing the previous node in the shortest path to each node as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
