Output State: **The `path_ba` list contains the shortest path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order, starting from `b` and ending at `a`. The variable `n` is the last node in this path before `a`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to append the previous node in the shortest path to `path_ba` until it reaches the starting node `a` (or a node with no previous node, indicated by `-1`).
- The `path_ba` list will contain the nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order, as the loop appends the previous node of the current node in each iteration.
- The variable `n` will be the last node in the path before `a` when the loop terminates.
