Output State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, inclusive; `u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where each list contains integers representing the indices of the other lists to which it is connected, forming an undirected graph. Each list in `u2vs` will have at least one element, except possibly the last list, which may remain empty if `n` is 1.
