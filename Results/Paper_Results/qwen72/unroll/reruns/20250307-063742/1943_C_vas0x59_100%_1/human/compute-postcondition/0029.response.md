The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3) representing the number of vertices in a tree. The following `n - 1` lines each contain two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing an edge between vertices `u` and `v`. After processing this input, the function returns `None`.

Functionality: **The function reads the number of vertices and edges of a tree from standard input and processes this information, but does not return any value.**
