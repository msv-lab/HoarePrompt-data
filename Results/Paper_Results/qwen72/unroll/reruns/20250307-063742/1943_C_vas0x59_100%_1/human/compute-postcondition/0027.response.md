To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order, starting from `b` and ending at `a`.
- `n` is the last node in this path before `a`.
- `ops` is populated based on the length of `path_ba`:
  - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples where the first element is the middle node `c` of `path_ba` and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` (inclusive).
  - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2, up to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`.

### Code:
```python
print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Length of `path_ba`**:
   - Let's denote the length of `path_ba` as `L`.
   - If `L` is odd, the middle node `c` is `path_ba[L // 2]`.
   - If `L` is even, `c1` and `c2` are the nodes at indices `L // 2 - 1` and `L // 2` respectively.

2. **Populate `ops` Based on the Length of `path_ba`**:
   - **Odd Length**:
     - `ops` will contain tuples `(c, i)` where `c` is the middle node and `i` ranges from 0 to `ci` (inclusive).
   - **Even Length**:
     - `ops` will contain tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2, up to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`.

3. **Transform and Print `ops`**:
   - The `map` function applies the lambda function `lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'` to each tuple in `ops`.
   - The lambda function increments the first element of each tuple by 1 and keeps the second element as is.
   - The `print` function then prints each transformed tuple on a new line.

### Output Calculation:
- **Odd Length**:
  - Suppose `path_ba` has an odd length `L` and the middle node `c` is at index `L // 2`.
  - `ops` will contain tuples `(c, i)` for `i` from 0 to `ci`.
  - The output will be a series of lines where each line is `c + 1` followed by `i`.

- **Even Length**:
  - Suppose `path_ba` has an even length `L` and the nodes `c1` and `c2` are at indices `L // 2 - 1` and `L // 2` respectively.
  - `ops` will contain tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2, up to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`.
  - The output will be a series of lines where each line is either `c1 + 1` followed by `i` or `c2 + 1` followed by `i`.

### Example Output:
- **Odd Length Example**:
  - Suppose `path_ba = [5, 3, 1]` (length 3, odd).
  - The middle node `c` is `path_ba[1] = 3`.
  - If `ci = 2`, then `ops = [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)]`.
  - The output will be:
    ```
    4 0
    4 1
    4 2
    ```

- **Even Length Example**:
  - Suppose `path_ba = [6, 4, 2, 1]` (length 4, even).
  - The nodes `c1` and `c2` are `path_ba[1] = 4` and `path_ba[2] = 2` respectively.
  - If `ci1 = 1`, then `ops = [(4, 1), (2, 1)]`.
  - The output will be:
    ```
    5 1
    3 1
    ```

### General Output:
- **Odd Length**:
  - Output: **c + 1 0**  
    **c + 1 1**  
    ...  
    **c + 1 ci**  
  - Where `c` is the middle node of `path_ba` and `ci` is the given value.

- **Even Length**:
  - Output: **c1 + 1 1**  
    **c2 + 1 1**  
    **c1 + 1 3**  
    **c2 + 1 3**  
    ...  
    **c1 + 1 (len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1)**  
    **c2 + 1 (len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1)**  
  - Where `c1` and `c2` are the nodes at indices `L // 2 - 1` and `L // 2` respectively, and `ci1` is the given value.

### Final Output:
Output: **[c + 1 0, c + 1 1, ..., c + 1 ci] (if the length of `path_ba` is odd)**  
**[c1 + 1 1, c2 + 1 1, c1 + 1 3, c2 + 1 3, ..., c1 + 1 (len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1), c2 + 1 (len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1)] (if the length of `path_ba` is even)**

Where:
- `c` is the middle node of `path_ba` if the length is odd.
- `c1` and `c2` are the nodes at indices `L // 2 - 1` and `L // 2` respectively if the length is even.
- `ci` and `ci1` are the given values.
