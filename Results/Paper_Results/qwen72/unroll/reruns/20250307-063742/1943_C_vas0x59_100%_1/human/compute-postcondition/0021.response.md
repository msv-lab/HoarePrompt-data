Output State: **The `path_ba` list contains the shortest path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order, starting from `b` and ending at `a`. The variable `n` is the last node in this path before `a`. The `ops` list is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is even. `ci2` is equal to half the length of `path_ba` (an integer value). `ci1` is equal to `ci2 - 1`. `c1` is the node at the index `ci1` in the `path_ba` list.**
