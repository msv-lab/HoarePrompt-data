Output State: **The `path_ba` list contains the shortest path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order, starting from `b` and ending at `a`. The variable `n` is the last node in this path before `a`. The `ops` list is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is an odd number. `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` (i.e., `ci = (len(path_ba) - 1) // 2`).**
