The function `func_2` reads the number of vertices and edges of a tree from standard input. It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path between two specific nodes `a` and `b`. The function then generates a list of operations (`ops`) based on the length of this path. If the path length is odd, it creates operations centered around the middle node of the path. If the path length is even, it creates operations involving the two middle nodes of the path. Finally, the function prints the number of operations and the operations themselves in a specific format, and returns `None`.
