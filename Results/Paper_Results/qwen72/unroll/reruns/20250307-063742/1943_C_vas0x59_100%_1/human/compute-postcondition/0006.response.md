Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, inclusive; `u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where each list contains integers representing the indices of other lists that are connected to it; `d` is the distance from the starting node (index 0) to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `u2vs` remains unchanged.
- The value of `d` remains unchanged.
- `a` is assigned the result of `func_1(d)`, where `d` is the distance from the starting node (index 0) to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function. The specific value of `a` depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
