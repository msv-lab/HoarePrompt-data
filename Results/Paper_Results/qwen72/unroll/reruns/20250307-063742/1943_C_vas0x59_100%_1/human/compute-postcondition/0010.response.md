Since the `while` loop statement is `while True:`, this loop will always execute at least once regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the first iteration to proceed.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, inclusive; `u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where each list contains integers representing the indices of other lists that are connected to it; `d` is the distance from the starting node (index 0) to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function using `a` as the starting node; `previous` is a list containing the previous node in the shortest path to each node as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`**
