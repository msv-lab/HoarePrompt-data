Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `path_ba` list contains the shortest path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order, starting from `b` and ending at `a`. The variable `n` is the last node in this path before `a`. The `ops` list is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is even. `ci2` is equal to half the length of `path_ba` (an integer value). `ci1` is equal to `ci2 - 1`. `c1` is the node at the index `ci1` in the `path_ba` list. `c2` is the node at the index `ci2` in the `path_ba` list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
    ops.append((c1, i))
    ops.append((c2, i))


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
