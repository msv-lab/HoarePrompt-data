To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ops))` statement, let's break down the precondition and the logic of how the `ops` list is populated.

### Initial State:
- `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order.
- `n` is the last node in this path before `a`.
- `ops` is populated based on the length of `path_ba`.

### Logic for Populating `ops`:
1. **If the length of `path_ba` is odd:**
   - `ops` contains tuples where the first element is the middle node `c` of `path_ba` and the second element is the index `i` ranging from 0 to `ci` (inclusive).

2. **If the length of `path_ba` is even:**
   - `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2, up to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the length of `path_ba`:**
   - Let's denote the length of `path_ba` as `L`.

2. **Case 1: Length of `path_ba` is odd (L is odd):**
   - The middle node `c` is at index `L // 2` in `path_ba`.
   - The `ops` list will contain tuples `(c, i)` for each `i` from 0 to `ci` (inclusive).
   - The number of tuples in `ops` will be `ci + 1`.

3. **Case 2: Length of `path_ba` is even (L is even):**
   - The `ops` list will contain tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2, up to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`.
   - The number of tuples in `ops` will be `((len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1) // 2) * 2`.

### Final Output:
- The output of the `print(len(ops))` statement will depend on whether the length of `path_ba` is odd or even.

**If the length of `path_ba` is odd:**
- Output: **ci + 1 (where ci is the value of ci)**

**If the length of `path_ba` is even:**
- Output: **((len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1) // 2) * 2 (where len(path_ba) is the length of the path_ba list and ci1 is the value of ci1)**

Since the exact values of `ci`, `ci1`, and `len(path_ba)` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is ci + 1 if the length of path_ba is odd, or ((len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1) // 2) * 2 if the length of path_ba is even)**
