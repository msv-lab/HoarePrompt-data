The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted, as it is not used outside the loop context. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that the input read from `sys.stdin` is a valid integer greater than 0.

State: **`int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than 0**
