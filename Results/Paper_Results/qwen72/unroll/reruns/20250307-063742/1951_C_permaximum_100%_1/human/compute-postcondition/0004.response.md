Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a heap (min-heap) of tuples where each tuple is (a_i, i) for i in the range [0, n-1]. `total_cost` is 0. `tickets_bought` is 0. `price_increase` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `price_increase` to 0, which is a new variable added to the state. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
