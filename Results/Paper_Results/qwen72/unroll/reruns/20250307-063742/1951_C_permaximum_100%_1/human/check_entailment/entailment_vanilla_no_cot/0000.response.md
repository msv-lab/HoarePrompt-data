Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase exactly `k` tickets over `n` days, with a maximum of `m` tickets purchasable per day, and with the price increase rule as described. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices for each day.

2. **Priority Queue Initialization**: The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) using the `heapq` module. Each element in the heap is a tuple `(price, day)`, where `price` is the ticket price on that day and `day` is the index of the day.

3. **Heap Operations**: The program uses a while loop to keep buying tickets until the total number of tickets bought (`tickets_bought`) reaches `k`. In each iteration:
   - It pops the smallest price from the heap.
   - It increases the price by the cumulative price increase (`price_increase`).
   - It calculates the number of tickets to buy on the current day, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets allowed per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - It updates the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets bought on the current day.
   - It updates the total number of tickets bought and the cumulative price increase.

4. **Output**: After processing all test cases, the program prints the total cost for each test case.

The logic ensures that the program always buys tickets at the lowest possible price, taking into account the price increase rule. This approach is efficient and handles the constraints provided in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for valid inputs.
