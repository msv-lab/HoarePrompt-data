### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires purchasing exactly `k` tickets over `n` days, with a maximum of `m` tickets per day. Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets on all subsequent days by `x`.

2. **Approach:**
   - The program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets on the cheapest available day.
   - It keeps track of the total cost, the number of tickets bought, and the cumulative price increase due to previous purchases.

3. **Algorithm Breakdown:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - Convert the list of prices into a min-heap.
     - Initialize `total_cost` to 0, `tickets_bought` to 0, and `price_increase` to 0.
   - **Main Loop:**
     - While the number of tickets bought is less than `k`:
       - Pop the smallest price from the heap.
       - Add the cumulative price increase to the current price.
       - Determine the number of tickets to buy on this day, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets per day) and `k - tickets_bought` (the remaining tickets needed).
       - Update the total cost by adding the product of the current price and the number of tickets bought.
       - Update the number of tickets bought.
       - Increase the cumulative price increase by the number of tickets bought.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Heap Usage:**
     - The use of a min-heap ensures that we always buy tickets on the cheapest available day, which is optimal.
   - **Price Increase:**
     - The price increase is correctly applied to all subsequent days, ensuring that the prices are updated as per the problem's rules.
   - **Ticket Purchase:**
     - The number of tickets to buy on each day is correctly limited by `m` and the remaining tickets needed.
   - **Total Cost Calculation:**
     - The total cost is correctly calculated by summing the product of the price and the number of tickets bought on each day.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Day:**
     - If `n = 1`, the program will buy all `k` tickets on the first day, which is correct.
   - **Single Ticket:**
     - If `k = 1`, the program will buy one ticket on the cheapest day, which is correct.
   - **Maximum Tickets per Day:**
     - If `m` is very large, the program will still correctly distribute the purchases over multiple days if needed, ensuring the price increase is applied correctly.
   - **Multiple Test Cases:**
     - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and processing each test case independently.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the heap operations, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Function Summary Verification:
- The function `func_1` correctly initializes a min-heap with the prices and their respective days.
- It correctly updates the price of the cheapest day by adding the cumulative price increase.
- It correctly determines the number of tickets to buy on each day and updates the total cost, tickets bought, and price increase accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days, adhering to the constraints and rules provided in the problem description. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
