Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of buying `k` tickets over `n` days with the constraint that a maximum of `m` tickets can be bought on any given day, and the price of tickets increases by the number of tickets bought on previous days. The approach taken in the program is to use a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets from the day with the lowest current price. This ensures that the total cost is minimized.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Priority Queue Initialization**: For each test case, a priority queue (min-heap) is initialized with the initial prices and their corresponding days.
3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program maintains a `total_cost` variable to keep track of the total cost of tickets bought.
   - It also maintains a `tickets_bought` variable to keep track of the number of tickets already purchased.
   - A `price_increase` variable is used to keep track of the total increase in prices due to tickets bought.
4. **Ticket Purchase Loop**:
   - The program enters a loop that continues until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
   - In each iteration, it pops the day with the lowest current price from the priority queue.
   - The price is adjusted by adding the `price_increase` to account for the increase in prices due to previous purchases.
   - The program then calculates the number of tickets to buy on this day, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum allowed per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - The cost of these tickets is added to `total_cost`.
   - The number of tickets bought is updated, and the `price_increase` is increased by the number of tickets bought on this day.
5. **Output**: After all tickets are bought, the total cost is printed for each test case.

The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements. It ensures that the tickets are bought in a way that minimizes the total cost, and it correctly updates the prices based on the number of tickets bought.

Given the execution summary, the program appears to work as intended and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
