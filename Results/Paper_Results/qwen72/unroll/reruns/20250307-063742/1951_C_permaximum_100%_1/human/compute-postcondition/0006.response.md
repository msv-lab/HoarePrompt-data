Output State: **`tickets_bought` is `k`, `total_cost` is the total cost of buying `k` tickets, and `price_increase` is the total number of tickets bought.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`, so after the loop, `tickets_bought` will be exactly `k`.
- `total_cost` accumulates the cost of buying tickets, where each ticket's price is the original price plus the `price_increase` at the time of purchase.
- `price_increase` is incremented by the number of tickets bought in each iteration, so after the loop, `price_increase` will be equal to `k` (since `tickets_bought` is `k`).

The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the heap `pq` will be modified as elements are popped from it, but its final state is not specified in the output.
