Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days, given the constraints and the price increase rule. Let's break down the logic and check if it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing and Function Call**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of prices.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Priority Queue Initialization**:
     - The function initializes a priority queue (min-heap) `pq` with tuples of the form `(price, day)`, where `price` is the ticket price on a given day and `day` is the index of that day.
     - This ensures that the lowest price is always at the top of the heap.
   - **Total Cost and Ticket Tracking**:
     - `total_cost` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total cost of tickets.
     - `tickets_bought` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of tickets purchased.
     - `price_increase` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the cumulative price increase due to tickets bought.
   - **Ticket Purchase Loop**:
     - The loop continues until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
     - In each iteration, it pops the lowest price from the heap.
     - It adds the cumulative price increase to the current price.
     - It calculates the number of tickets to buy on the current day, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets that can be bought per day) and `k - tickets_bought` (the remaining tickets needed).
     - It updates the `total_cost` by adding the cost of the tickets bought on the current day.
     - It updates `tickets_bought` by adding the number of tickets bought.
     - It updates `price_increase` by adding the number of tickets bought.
   - **Return Total Cost**:
     - After the loop, the function returns the `total_cost`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Price Increase**: The program correctly accounts for the price increase by adding `price_increase` to the price of each ticket bought.
   - **Ticket Limit**: The program ensures that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day.
   - **Total Tickets**: The program ensures that exactly `k` tickets are bought.
   - **Minimum Cost**: The use of a priority queue ensures that the program always buys tickets from the lowest available price, which is a greedy approach that minimizes the total cost.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and the price increase rule appropriately, and it ensures that the minimum cost is achieved.

Correctness: **True**
