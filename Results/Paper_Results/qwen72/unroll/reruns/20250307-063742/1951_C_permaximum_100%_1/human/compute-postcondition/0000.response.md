The code snippet creates a list `pq` where each element is a tuple containing a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index. The list `pq` is constructed by iterating over the `prices` list using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element in the `prices` list.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple is (a_i, i) for i in the range [0, n-1].**
