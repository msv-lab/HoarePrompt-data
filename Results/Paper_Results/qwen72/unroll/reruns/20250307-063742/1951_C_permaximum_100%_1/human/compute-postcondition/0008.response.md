The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of different ticket types, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of tickets available for each type, with the constraint 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9.
- `k` is an integer representing the number of tickets to buy, with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9).
- `prices` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` represents the price of one ticket of the i-th type, with the constraint 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The function returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. It returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where `n` is the number of different ticket types, `m` is the number of tickets available for each type, `k` is the number of tickets to buy, and `prices` is a list of prices for each ticket type.**
