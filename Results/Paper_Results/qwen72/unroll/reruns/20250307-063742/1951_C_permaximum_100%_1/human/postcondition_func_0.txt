The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. It calculates and returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where `n` is the number of different ticket types, `m` is the maximum number of tickets available for each type, `k` is the total number of tickets to buy, and `prices` is a list of prices for each ticket type. After the function concludes, `k` tickets have been bought, and the total cost reflects the sum of the prices of these tickets, considering that the price of each ticket type increases by the number of tickets already bought from that type.
