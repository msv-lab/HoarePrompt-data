Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets based on the given constraints and rules. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of prices `prices`.

2. **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**: The program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always select the day with the lowest current price for purchasing tickets. This ensures that the tickets are bought at the lowest possible cost.

3. **Price Increase Logic**: The program correctly accounts for the price increase after purchasing tickets on a given day. The variable `price_increase` keeps track of the total number of tickets bought so far, and this value is added to the price of each ticket before purchasing.

4. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: The program calculates the number of tickets to buy on each day as the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets that can be bought on a day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`). This ensures that the program does not exceed the daily purchase limit and buys exactly `k` tickets in total.

5. **Total Cost Calculation**: The total cost is updated by multiplying the current price (including the price increase) by the number of tickets bought on that day.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is less than or equal to `m` (i.e., all tickets can be bought in one day) and when `k` is much larger than `m` (i.e., tickets need to be bought over multiple days).

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
