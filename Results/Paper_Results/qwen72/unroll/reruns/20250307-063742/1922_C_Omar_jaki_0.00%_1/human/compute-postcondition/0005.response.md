Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a list of city coordinates and a list of queries. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum travel cost between pairs of cities specified in the queries. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that all test cases have been processed and the results for each query have been printed. **
