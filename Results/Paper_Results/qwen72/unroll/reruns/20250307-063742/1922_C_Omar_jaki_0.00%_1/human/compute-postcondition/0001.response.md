Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) cities with coordinates `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) in ascending order, and `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) queries. Each query consists of two integers `x_i` and `y_i` (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i), representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost needs to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is determined uniquely. `r` is a function that reads and maps input to integers.** 

The value of `t` is now specifically the integer read from the input by the function `r`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
