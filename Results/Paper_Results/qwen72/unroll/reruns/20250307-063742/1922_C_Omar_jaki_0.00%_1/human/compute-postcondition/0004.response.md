The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each containing a list of city coordinates and a list of queries. Specifically, it accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer representing the number of cities (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
  - `a`: A list of integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9).
  - `m`: An integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5).
  - `queries`: A list of tuples, each containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost needs to be calculated (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i).

The function returns a list of results for each query, where each result is the minimum travel cost between the cities specified in the query. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is determined uniquely.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing a list of city coordinates and a list of queries. It returns a list of minimum travel costs for each query, where each query specifies two cities.**
