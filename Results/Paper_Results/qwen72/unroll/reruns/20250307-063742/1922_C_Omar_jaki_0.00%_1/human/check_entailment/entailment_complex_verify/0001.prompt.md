You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5 1

Output

    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) cities with coordinates a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) in ascending order, and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) queries.

    #State: The loop completes all iterations, and the final output state is that `t` is 0, all test cases have been processed, and the results for each query in each test case have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a list of city coordinates and a list of queries. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum travel cost between pairs of cities specified in the queries. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that all test cases have been processed and the results for each query have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input Format**:
   - The program should handle multiple test cases.
   - Each test case consists of:
     - The number of cities \( n \).
     - The coordinates of the cities \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) in ascending order.
     - The number of queries \( m \).
     - Each query consists of two cities \( x_i \) and \( y_i \).

2. **Output Format**:
   - For each query, the program should output the minimum number of coins required to travel from city \( x_i \) to city \( y_i \).

3. **Travel Rules**:
   - You can travel to any city \( y \) from city \( x \) and pay \( |a_x - a_y| \) coins.
   - You can travel to the closest city to \( x \) and pay 1 coin.

4. **Closest City**:
   - The closest city to \( x \) is the city \( j \) such that the distance between \( x \) and \( j \) is not greater than the distance between \( x \) and any other city \( k \).
   - The closest city is unique for each city.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program uses a lambda function `r` to read input and convert it to integers.
   - It reads the number of test cases \( t \).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and the coordinates of the cities.
   - It pads the list of coordinates with very large negative and positive values to handle edge cases (cities at the ends of the list).

3. **Calculating Closest City Distances**:
   - The program uses a list `b` to store cumulative distances.
   - It iterates over the coordinates using `zip` to calculate the distances between consecutive cities.
   - It updates the list `b` with the cumulative distances, considering the closest city rule.

4. **Handling Queries**:
   - For each query, it reads the cities \( x_i \) and \( y_i \).
   - It calculates the minimum number of coins required to travel from \( x_i \) to \( y_i \) using the precomputed distances in `b`.

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
   - It reads the number of cities \( n \) and the coordinates of the cities.
   - It reads the number of queries \( m \) and processes each query.

2. **Coordinate Padding**:
   - The program pads the list of coordinates with very large negative and positive values to handle edge cases. This ensures that the closest city for the first and last cities is correctly determined.

3. **Cumulative Distance Calculation**:
   - The program uses `zip` to iterate over the coordinates and calculate the distances between consecutive cities.
   - It updates the list `b` with the cumulative distances, considering the closest city rule.
   - The expression `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)` is used to determine if the current city is closer to the previous or next city. This is a bit unconventional but works because \( v \) is the distance between the current city and the next city, and the expression evaluates to 1 if the condition is true, otherwise 0.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins required to travel from \( x_i \) to \( y_i \) using the precomputed distances in `b`.
   - It handles the case where \( x_i < y_i \) and \( x_i > y_i \) by using the appropriate indices in `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the input and output formats, and it correctly calculates the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities based on the given rules. The use of cumulative distances and the closest city rule is implemented in a way that should work for the given constraints.
