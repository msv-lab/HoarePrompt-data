Output State: **The loop completes all iterations, and the final output state is that `t` is 0, all test cases have been processed, and the results for each query in each test case have been printed.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` is reduced to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, the loop calculates the minimum travel costs between specified pairs of cities and prints these costs. The final state of the program is that all queries for all test cases have been resolved and their results printed, and the loop terminates.
