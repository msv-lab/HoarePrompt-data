Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an undirected weighted graph represented by the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges `m` such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n·(n - 1)/2, 2·10^5). The edges are given as a list of tuples, each containing three integers (u, v, w) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6, representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. The graph does not contain loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices. The total number of test cases `t` is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of all values of `m` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
