Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and then reads `n-1` pairs of integers to construct an adjacency list `adj` representing a tree. It then performs a binary search to determine the maximum integer `L` such that the tree can be cut into at most `k` connected components, each having at least `L` vertices. The function prints the value of `L` for each test case. The function does not return any value, and the state of the program is reset for each test case, with `n`, `k`, `adj`, `L`, `R`, and `numCuts` being reinitialized. After all test cases are processed, the function concludes. **
