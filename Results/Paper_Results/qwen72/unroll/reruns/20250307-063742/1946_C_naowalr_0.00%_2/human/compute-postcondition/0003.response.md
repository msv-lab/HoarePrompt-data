The function `func_1` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `adj`. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, and `adj` is a list of lists where each sublist represents the adjacency list of a vertex in the tree. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `adj`. It processes a tree represented by the adjacency list `adj` and returns a result based on the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.**
