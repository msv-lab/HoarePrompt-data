The only variables in the loop head are `z` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, and `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, and `adj` is a list of lists. However, these conditions do not directly affect the loop's execution, as the loop only depends on `t`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `z` should be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0**
