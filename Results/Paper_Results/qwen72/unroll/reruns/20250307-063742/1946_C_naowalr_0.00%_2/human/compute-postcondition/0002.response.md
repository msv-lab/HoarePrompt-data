Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and after each iteration, `n` and `k` are updated with new values from the input, `adj` is reset to a new list of lists representing the adjacency list of a new tree, `L` is set to 1, `R` is set to 100001, and `numCuts` is set to 0. After the loop finishes, the final value of `L` is printed for each iteration. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `L`, `R`, and `numCuts` are not retained between iterations, and the loop ends when all `t` iterations are completed.**
