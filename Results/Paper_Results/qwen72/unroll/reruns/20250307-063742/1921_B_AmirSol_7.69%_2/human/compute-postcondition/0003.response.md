Output State: **`counter` is the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, and `i` is `n`.**

Natural language description: After the loop has finished executing, the variable `counter` will hold the total number of positions where the strings `s1` and `s2` differ. If two consecutive differing positions also have different characters in `s1`, the loop increments `i` by 2 to skip the next position. Otherwise, it increments `i` by 1. The loop continues until `i` reaches `n`, the length of the strings. Therefore, at the end of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`.
