Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. It returns the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, with a special consideration that if two consecutive positions differ and the characters in `s1` at these positions are different, they are counted as a single difference. After the function concludes, `counter` holds the final count of differences, and `i` is equal to `n`. **
