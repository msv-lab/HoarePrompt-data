Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of days (operations) required to rearrange the cats from the initial state to the desired state. The function `func_1` iterates through the strings `s1` and `s2` representing the initial and final states of the boxes, respectively. It counts the number of operations needed to make the states match by either moving a cat, adding a cat, or removing a cat, as described in the problem statement.

The logic in `func_1` is as follows:
- It initializes a counter to keep track of the number of operations.
- It iterates through the boxes (characters in the strings).
- If the current box in `s1` does not match the corresponding box in `s2`, it checks if the next box also needs to be changed and if the current and next boxes have different states in `s1`.
- If so, it performs a move operation (which counts as one operation) and skips the next box.
- If not, it performs a single operation (either add or remove a cat) and moves to the next box.
- If the current box in `s1` matches the corresponding box in `s2`, it simply moves to the next box.

This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is counted, as it tries to perform move operations whenever possible, which are more efficient than individual add or remove operations. The program also correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem description.
