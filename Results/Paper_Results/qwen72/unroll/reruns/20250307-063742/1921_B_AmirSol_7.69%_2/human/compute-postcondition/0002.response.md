The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`. Given the state right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5. Since `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 1, the condition `i < n` is already satisfied, and the loop can execute the first time without any adjustments.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 0, `i` is 0**
