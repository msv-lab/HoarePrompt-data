The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Given the initial state, `t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 1000. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and it starts at 0 and increments with each iteration, but its initial value is not relevant to the loop's execution condition.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
