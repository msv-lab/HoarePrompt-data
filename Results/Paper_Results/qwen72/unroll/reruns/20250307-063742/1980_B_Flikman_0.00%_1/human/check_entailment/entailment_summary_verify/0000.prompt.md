You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        same_value_count = 0
        for value in a:
            if value == favorite_value:
                same_value_count += 1
        greater_count = 0
        for value in a:
            if value > favorite_value:
                greater_count += 1
        if greater_count >= k:
            print('YES')
        elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then checks if the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the value at index `f-1` is at least `k`. If so, it prints 'YES'. If the sum of the number of elements greater than and equal to the value at index `f-1` is less than or equal to `k`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. The function does not modify the input variables and does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube's value is the same as other cubes, and the number of cubes with a greater value is less than `k`, but the total number of cubes with the same or greater value is also less than `k`. In such a case, the favorite cube should not be removed, but the program incorrectly prints "MAYBE".

Example case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

Expected Output:
MAYBE

Actual Output:
NO
```

In this case, the favorite cube (index 2) has a value of 3. There is 1 cube with a value greater than 3 (the cube with value 4). After sorting, the cubes could be arranged as `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]` or `[4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`. In the first arrangement, the favorite cube is removed, but in the second arrangement, it is not. Therefore, the correct output should be "MAYBE", but the program outputs "NO".
