Output State: **The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are re-assigned within each iteration of the loop. The loop will print 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each iteration based on the conditions provided, but the final state of the variables will be the same as the initial state.**
