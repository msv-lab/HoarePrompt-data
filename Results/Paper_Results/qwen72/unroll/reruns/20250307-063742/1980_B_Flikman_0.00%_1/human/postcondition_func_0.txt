The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then checks if the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the value at index `f-1` is at least `k`. If so, it prints 'YES'. If the sum of the number of elements greater than and equal to the value at index `f-1` is less than or equal to `k`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. The function does not modify the input variables and does not return any value.
