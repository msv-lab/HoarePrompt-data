Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube's value is the same as other cubes, and the number of cubes with a greater value is less than `k`, but the total number of cubes with the same or greater value is also less than `k`. In such a case, the favorite cube should not be removed, but the program incorrectly prints "MAYBE".

Example case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

Expected Output:
MAYBE

Actual Output:
NO
```

In this case, the favorite cube (index 2) has a value of 3. There is 1 cube with a value greater than 3 (the cube with value 4). After sorting, the cubes could be arranged as `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]` or `[4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`. In the first arrangement, the favorite cube is removed, but in the second arrangement, it is not. Therefore, the correct output should be "MAYBE", but the program outputs "NO".
