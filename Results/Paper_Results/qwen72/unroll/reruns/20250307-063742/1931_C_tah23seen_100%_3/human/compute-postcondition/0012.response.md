Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns an integer. It determines the indices `i` and `j` such that `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is different from its next element, and `j` is the index of the last element in `arr` that is different from its previous element. If the first and last elements of `arr` are the same, the function returns the maximum of `j - i - 1` and `0`. If the first and last elements are different, the function returns the maximum of `0` and the minimum of `(n - i - 1)` and `j`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. **
