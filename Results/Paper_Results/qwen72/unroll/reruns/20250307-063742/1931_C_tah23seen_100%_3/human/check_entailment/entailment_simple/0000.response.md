### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes `i` to 0 and `j` to `n - 1`.
   - It then iterates from the start of the array to find the first index `i` where the element is different from the next element.
   - Similarly, it iterates from the end of the array to find the last index `j` where the element is different from the previous element.
   - If the first element of the array is equal to the last element, it returns the maximum value between `j - i - 1` and 0. This is because if the first and last elements are the same, the cost to make the entire array equal is the length of the segment between the first and last different elements, minus one (since the segment itself is inclusive).
   - If the first element is not equal to the last element, it returns the maximum value between 0 and the minimum value of `n - i - 1` and `j`. This is because the cost to make the entire array equal is the minimum of the two segments: from the start to the first different element and from the last different element to the end.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all elements in the array are the same, `i` will be `n - 1` and `j` will be `0`, and the function will return 0, which is correct.
   - If the array has only one element, the function will return 0, which is correct.
   - If the array has two elements and they are different, the function will return 1, which is correct.

4. **General Case**:
   - The function correctly identifies the segments of the array that need to be modified to make all elements equal.
   - The cost calculation is based on the minimum segment length, which is a valid approach to minimize the cost.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem as described and produces the correct output for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
