Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements in the array equal by selecting a subarray and setting all elements within that subarray to a single value. The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray selected.

The function `func_1` works as follows:
1. It initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
2. It moves the pointer `i` to the right as long as the current element is the same as the next element.
3. It moves the pointer `j` to the left as long as the current element is the same as the previous element.
4. After the pointers are adjusted, it checks if the first and last elements of the array are the same.
   - If they are the same, it returns the maximum of `j - i - 1` and `0`. This is because if the first and last elements are the same, the minimum cost to make all elements equal is the length of the subarray between the first and last differing elements, minus one (since the first and last elements are already equal).
   - If they are different, it returns the maximum of `0` and the minimum of `(n - i - 1)` and `j`. This is because the cost will be the length of the shorter subarray that needs to be set to a single value to make the entire array equal.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program:
- If the first and last elements are different, the program should consider the cost of setting all elements to the value of the first element or the last element, or any other value that appears in the array. The current logic only considers the length of the subarray from `i` to the end or from the start to `j`, which may not always be the minimum cost.

For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`:
- The program will set `i` to 0 and `j` to 5.
- Since `arr[0]` (1) is not equal to `arr[-1]` (1), it will return `max(min(6 - 0 - 1, 5), 0)`, which is `5`.
- However, the correct answer is `4`, which can be achieved by setting the subarray from index 1 to 4 to the value `1`.

To fix this, the program should consider the cost of setting all elements to the most frequent value in the array, which is not currently being done.

Correctness: **False**
