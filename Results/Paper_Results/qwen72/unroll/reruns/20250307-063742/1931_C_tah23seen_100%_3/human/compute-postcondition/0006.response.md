Output State: **`i` remains the same, and `j` is the index of the last element in `arr` that is different from its previous element, or `j` is `0` if all elements in `arr` are the same.**

Natural Language Explanation: The loop decreases `j` until it finds an element in `arr` that is different from the element before it, or until `j` reaches `0`. The value of `i` is not modified by the loop, so it remains as it was initially.
