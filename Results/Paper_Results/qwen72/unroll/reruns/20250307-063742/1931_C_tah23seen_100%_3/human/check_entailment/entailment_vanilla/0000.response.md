To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Make all elements of the array equal with the minimum cost.
2. **Operation**: Select three integers \( i, j, x \) (where \( 1 \le i \le j \le n \)) and assign all elements from index \( i \) to \( j \) the value \( x \). The cost of this operation is \( j - i + 1 \) burles.
3. **Constraints**:
   - \( 1 \le t \le 10^4 \) (number of test cases)
   - \( 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 \) (size of the array)
   - \( 1 \le a_i \le n \) (array elements)
   - The sum of \( n \) for all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \).

### Solution Analysis:
The provided program uses the function `func_1` to determine the minimum cost. Let's analyze the logic inside `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `j` is initialized to `len(arr) - 1`.

2. **Finding the First and Last Different Elements**:
   - The first `while` loop increments `i` until it finds an element that is different from the next element.
   - The second `while` loop decrements `j` until it finds an element that is different from the previous element.

3. **Checking if the First and Last Elements are the Same**:
   - If `arr[0] == arr[-1]`, it means the array is already mostly uniform, and the cost is `max(j - i - 1, 0)`. This is because the elements between `i` and `j` (exclusive) are the only ones that might need to be changed.
   - If `arr[0] != arr[-1]`, it means the array is not uniform, and the cost is `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`. This is because the minimum cost to make the array uniform is either the length of the suffix starting from `i` or the length of the prefix ending at `j`.

### Test Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `6 1 2 3 4 5 1`
   - Output: `4`
   - Reasoning: The array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The first and last elements are the same, so we need to change the middle elements. The cost is \( 4 - 0 - 1 = 4 \).

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `7 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Reasoning: The array is already uniform, so no changes are needed. The cost is `0`.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `8 8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8`
   - Output: `2`
   - Reasoning: The array is `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`. The first and last elements are the same, so we need to change the middle elements. The cost is \( 5 - 3 - 1 = 2 \).

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Reasoning: The array is already uniform, so no changes are needed. The cost is `0`.

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `2 1 2`
   - Output: `1`
   - Reasoning: The array is `[1, 2]`. We need to change one element to make the array uniform. The cost is `1`.

6. **Test Case 6**:
   - Input: `3 1 2 3`
   - Output: `2`
   - Reasoning: The array is `[1, 2, 3]`. We need to change two elements to make the array uniform. The cost is `2`.

7. **Test Case 7**:
   - Input: `7 4 3 2 7 1 1 3`
   - Output: `6`
   - Reasoning: The array is `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`. We need to change six elements to make the array uniform. The cost is `6`.

8. **Test Case 8**:
   - Input: `9 9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3`
   - Output: `7`
   - Reasoning: The array is `[9, 9, 2, 9, 2, 5, 5, 5, 3]`. We need to change seven elements to make the array uniform. The cost is `7`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the minimum cost to make the array uniform for each test case. The logic of finding the first and last different elements and then calculating the minimum cost based on the length of the prefix and suffix is sound and matches the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
