Output State: **`i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is different from its next element, or `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` if all elements in `arr` are the same. `j` remains `n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop increments `i` by 1 as long as the current element `arr[i]` is equal to the next element `arr[i + 1]`.
- If all elements in `arr` are the same, `i` will eventually reach `len(arr) - 1` because the loop condition `i < len(arr) - 1` will no longer be true.
- If there is a point where `arr[i]` is different from `arr[i + 1]`, the loop will stop, and `i` will be the index of the first such element.
- The variable `j` is not modified within the loop, so it remains `n - 1`.
