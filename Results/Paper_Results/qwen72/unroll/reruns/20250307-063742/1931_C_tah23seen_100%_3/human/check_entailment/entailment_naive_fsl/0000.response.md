Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal in some scenarios. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

The expected output is 3 because the optimal solution is to select `i = 1`, `j = 3`, and `x = 2`, which will make the array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 1]`, and then select `i = 4`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2`, which will make the array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. The total cost is `(3 - 1 + 1) + (5 - 4 + 1) = 3`.

However, the program returns 1, which is incorrect. The program only considers the edges of the array and does not account for the possibility of making all elements equal by selecting a different value from the middle of the array.
