To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```python
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `i < len(arr) - 1`**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `len(arr)` is `n`, which is the length of `arr`.
   - Therefore, the condition `i < len(arr) - 1` simplifies to `0 < n - 1`.
   - For this condition to be true, `n` must be greater than 1. Since `n` is the length of `arr`, this means `arr` must have at least 2 elements.

2. **Condition 2: `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`**
   - `i` is 0, so this condition checks if `arr[0] == arr[1]`.
   - For the loop to execute, `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will execute if `arr` has at least 2 elements and the first two elements of `arr` are equal.
- The state of `arr` needs to be adjusted to ensure that `arr[0] == arr[1]` and `len(arr) >= 2`.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1; `j` is `n - 1`; `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`**
