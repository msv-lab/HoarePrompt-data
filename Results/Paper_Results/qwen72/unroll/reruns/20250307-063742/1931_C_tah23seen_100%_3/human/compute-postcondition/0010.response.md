Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between 0 and the minimum value of (n - i - 1) and j, where n is the length of the list `arr`, `i` remains the same, and `j` is the index of the last element in `arr` that is different from its previous element, or `j` is `0` if all elements in `arr` are the same. Additionally, the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`.**
