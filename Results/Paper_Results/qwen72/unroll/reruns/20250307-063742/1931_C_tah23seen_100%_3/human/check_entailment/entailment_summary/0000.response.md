Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal by selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a chosen value. The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray. The function `func_1` is designed to determine this minimum cost.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to compute the minimum cost and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function initializes `i` to 0 and `j` to the last index of the array.
   - It then moves `i` to the right as long as the current element is the same as the next element.
   - Similarly, it moves `j` to the left as long as the current element is the same as the previous element.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it returns the maximum of `j - i - 1` and `0`. This means it will return the length of the subarray that needs to be changed, excluding the first and last elements.
   - If the first and last elements are different, it returns the maximum of `0` and the minimum of `(n - i - 1)` and `j`. This means it will return the length of the smallest subarray that needs to be changed to make all elements equal.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the array is already all the same, the function correctly returns `0`.
   - If the array has only one element, the function correctly returns `0`.
   - If the array has two elements and they are different, the function correctly returns `1`.

4. **General Case:**
   - The function correctly identifies the subarray that needs to be changed to make all elements equal.
   - The cost is calculated based on the length of this subarray, which is the minimum number of burles required.

5. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the function correctly identifies that the subarray from index 1 to 4 needs to be changed, which costs `4` burles.
   - For the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the function correctly returns `0` since the array is already all the same.
   - For the array `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`, the function correctly identifies that the subarray from index 3 to 4 needs to be changed, which costs `2` burles.
   - For the array `[1]`, the function correctly returns `0`.
   - For the array `[1, 2]`, the function correctly returns `1`.
   - For the array `[1, 2, 3]`, the function correctly returns `2`.
   - For the array `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`, the function correctly identifies that the subarray from index 0 to 6 needs to be changed, which costs `6` burles.
   - For the array `[9, 9, 2, 9, 2, 5, 5, 5, 3]`, the function correctly identifies that the subarray from index 2 to 8 needs to be changed, which costs `7` burles.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all cases correctly and efficiently.
