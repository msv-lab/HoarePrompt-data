To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `j > 0`**
   - This condition ensures that `j` is not the first index of the array. If `j` is 0, the loop will not execute.
   - Given that `j` remains `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array, `j` will be `n - 1` initially.
   - For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

2. **Condition 2: `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`**
   - This condition checks if the current element at index `j` is equal to the previous element at index `j - 1`.
   - If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[j - 1]`, the loop will not execute.
   - Given that `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is different from its next element, or `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` if all elements in `arr` are the same, we need to ensure that `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]` for the loop to execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`j` must be greater than 0**: This is already satisfied if `n > 1`.
- **`arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`**: This is the critical condition. Since `j` is `n - 1`, we need to ensure that the last element of the array is equal to the second-to-last element.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes the first time, `n` must be greater than 1, and the last element of the array must be equal to the second-to-last element.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is different from its next element, or `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` if all elements in `arr` are the same, `j` remains `n - 1`, and `n` must be greater than 1, and `arr[n-1]` must be equal to `arr[n-2]`**
