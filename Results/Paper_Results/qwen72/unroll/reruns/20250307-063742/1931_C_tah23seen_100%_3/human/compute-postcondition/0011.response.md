The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each element in `arr` is between 1 and the length of `arr`.

**Case_1:** If the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, the function returns the maximum value between `j - i - 1` and `0`, where `i` is the index of the first element, and `j` is the index of the last element in `arr` that is different from its previous element. If all elements in `arr` are the same, `j` is `0`.

**Case_2:** If the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`, the function returns the maximum value between `0` and the minimum value of `(n - i - 1)` and `j`, where `n` is the length of `arr`, `i` is the index of the first element, and `j` is the index of the last element in `arr` that is different from its previous element. If all elements in `arr` are the same, `j` is `0`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a value based on the indices of the first and last differing elements in the list. If the first and last elements are the same, it returns the maximum of `j - i - 1` and `0`. If the first and last elements are different, it returns the maximum of `0` and the minimum of `(n - i - 1)` and `j`.**
