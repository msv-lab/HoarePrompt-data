### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined without any parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should take the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases` as parameters.
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1()` in a loop, but `func_1` does not handle the input for each test case correctly. It should read `x` inside the loop for each test case.

2. **Subsequence Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to decompose `x` into a sum of powers of 2, which is a good approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of powers of 2.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle the case where `x` is 1. The problem states that `X` is at least 2, so this case should not occur, but the program does not check for this explicitly.

3. **Array Construction:**
   - The program constructs the array `ansv` by appending the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2. This is not correct because the elements of the array should be integers, not the lengths of the subsequences.
   - The program should construct an array where each element is unique and strictly increasing, and the number of increasing subsequences should match `x`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv`. However, the elements of `ansv` are not correctly constructed to form the required array.
   - The output for `x = 2` is `1 0`, which is correct, but for other values of `x`, the output is incorrect because the elements of `ansv` are not in the correct range and do not form the required array.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle the input for each test case, and the array construction logic is flawed. The elements of the array should be unique and strictly increasing, and the program should ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches the given `x`. The current implementation does not meet these requirements.
