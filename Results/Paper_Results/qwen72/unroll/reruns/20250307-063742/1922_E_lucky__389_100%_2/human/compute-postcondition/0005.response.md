The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `0`. 

Based on the initial state:
- `mx` is 0.
- `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description.
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
- `test_cases` is a list of integers, each representing a value of X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18).
- `x` is an input integer with the current value of 2.
- `subseq_lens` is an empty list.

The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `0`, which is a constant value and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.

Output: **0**
