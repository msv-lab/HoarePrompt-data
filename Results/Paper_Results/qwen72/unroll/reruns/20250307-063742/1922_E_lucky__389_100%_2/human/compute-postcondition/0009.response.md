Output State: **`mx` is the maximum length of the subsequence of powers of 2 that sum up to the input `x`, `subseq_lens` is a list of the lengths of these subsequences, and `x` is 0.**

### Explanation:
- The outer loop continues as long as `x` is not zero.
- Inside the loop, the inner loop finds the largest power of 2 (i.e., `2 ** (i - 1)`) that is less than or equal to `x`.
- This power of 2 is then subtracted from `x`, and the length of this power of 2 (i.e., `i - 1`) is appended to the `subseq_lens` list.
- The variable `mx` is updated to the maximum value of the lengths found so far.
- The loop continues until `x` becomes zero, meaning all the powers of 2 that sum up to the initial value of `x` have been subtracted.
- After the loop, `x` will be 0, `subseq_lens` will contain the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2, and `mx` will be the maximum length among these subsequences.
