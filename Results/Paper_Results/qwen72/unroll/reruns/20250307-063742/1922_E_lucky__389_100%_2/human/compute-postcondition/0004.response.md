The given Python code snippet is:
```
print(1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `mx` is 0.
   - `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description.
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
   - `test_cases` is a list of integers, each representing a value of X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18).
   - `x` is an input integer with the current value of 2.
   - `subseq_lens` is an empty list.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement simply prints the integer `1`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It directly prints the integer `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
