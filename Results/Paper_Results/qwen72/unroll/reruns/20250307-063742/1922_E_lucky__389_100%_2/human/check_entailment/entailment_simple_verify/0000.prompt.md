You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where `X` is a power of 2. For example, if `X = 4`, the program will output an incorrect array. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Powers of 2**:
   - When `X` is a power of 2, the program will subtract the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `X` and append the corresponding index to `subseq_lens`.
   - For `X = 4`, the program will subtract `2^2 = 4` and append `2` to `subseq_lens`. This leaves `X` as 0, and the program will print the array `[0, 1, 2]`.
   - However, the array `[0, 1, 2]` has 7 increasing subsequences: `[], [0], [1], [2], [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2]`, which is not equal to 4.

2. **Incorrect Subsequence Count**:
   - The program does not correctly count the number of increasing subsequences for the constructed array. The logic for constructing the array and counting subsequences is flawed.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the edge case where `X` is 1. The problem description specifies that `X` can be as low as 2, but the program should still correctly handle the case where `X` is 1, even though it is not in the input range.

To correct the program, the logic for constructing the array and counting the increasing subsequences needs to be revised to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X` for all valid inputs.
