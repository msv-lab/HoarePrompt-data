### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to construct an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should print `-1`.

2. **Approach in the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - The function `func_1` is called to handle each test case.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the integer \( X \).
   - If \( X \) is 2, it prints a single element array `[0]` and returns.
   - For other values of \( X \), it tries to decompose \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2.
   - It keeps track of the lengths of these subsequences in the list `subseq_lens`.
   - It then constructs an array `ansv` based on these lengths.

4. **Decomposition of \( X \)**:
   - The program uses a loop to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( X \) and subtracts it from \( X \).
   - This process continues until \( X \) becomes 0.
   - The lengths of these subsequences are stored in `subseq_lens`.

5. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The program constructs an array `ansv` where the first \( mx \) elements are a sequence from 0 to \( mx-1 \).
   - It then appends the elements from `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv`.

7. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the case when \( X \) is 2 by printing a single element array `[0]`.
   - For other values of \( X \), it decomposes \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2, which is a valid approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of powers of 2.
   - The constructed array `ansv` should have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, but there is a potential issue with the way the array is constructed.
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1, which should be impossible as the problem states \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \).
   - The program does not check if the length of the array exceeds 200, which is a requirement of the problem.

8. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1, which is outside the valid range but should still be checked.
   - The program does not ensure that the length of the array does not exceed 200.
   - The program does not print `-1` if it is impossible to construct the array.

### Conclusion:
The program has several issues that could lead to incorrect results or outputs that do not meet the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1 and does not ensure the length of the array does not exceed 200. Additionally, it does not print `-1` if it is impossible to construct the array.

Correctness: **False**
