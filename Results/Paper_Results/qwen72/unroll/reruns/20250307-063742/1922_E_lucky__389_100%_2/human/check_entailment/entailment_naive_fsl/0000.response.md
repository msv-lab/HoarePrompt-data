Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where `X` is a power of 2. For example, if `X = 4`, the program will output an incorrect array. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Powers of 2**:
   - When `X` is a power of 2, the program will subtract the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `X` and append the corresponding index to `subseq_lens`.
   - For `X = 4`, the program will subtract `2^2 = 4` and append `2` to `subseq_lens`. This leaves `X` as 0, and the program will print the array `[0, 1, 2]`.
   - However, the array `[0, 1, 2]` has 7 increasing subsequences: `[], [0], [1], [2], [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2]`, which is not equal to 4.

2. **Incorrect Subsequence Count**:
   - The program does not correctly count the number of increasing subsequences for the constructed array. The logic for constructing the array and counting subsequences is flawed.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the edge case where `X` is 1. The problem description specifies that `X` can be as low as 2, but the program should still correctly handle the case where `X` is 1, even though it is not in the input range.

To correct the program, the logic for constructing the array and counting the increasing subsequences needs to be revised to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X` for all valid inputs.
