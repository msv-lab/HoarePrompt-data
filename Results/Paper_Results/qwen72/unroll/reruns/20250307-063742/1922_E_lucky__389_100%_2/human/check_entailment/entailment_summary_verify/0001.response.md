### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to construct an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should print `-1`.

2. **Approach in the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - The function `func_1` is called to handle each test case.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the integer \( X \).
   - If \( X \) is 2, it prints a single element array `[0]` and returns.
   - For other values of \( X \), it decomposes \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2.
   - It keeps track of the lengths of these subsequences in the list `subseq_lens`.
   - It then constructs an array `ansv` based on these lengths.

4. **Decomposition of \( X \)**:
   - The program uses a loop to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( X \) and subtracts it from \( X \).
   - This process continues until \( X \) becomes 0.
   - The lengths of these subsequences are stored in `subseq_lens`.

5. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The program constructs an array `ansv` where the first \( mx \) elements are a sequence from 0 to \( mx-1 \).
   - It then appends the elements from `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv`.

7. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Handling \( X = 2 \)**:
     - The program correctly prints a single element array `[0]` for \( X = 2 \).
   - **Decomposition of \( X \)**:
     - The program correctly decomposes \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2, which is a valid approach.
   - **Constructing the Array**:
     - The program constructs the array `ansv` by first creating a sequence from 0 to \( mx-1 \) and then appending the lengths from `subseq_lens`.
     - However, this approach does not ensure that the array will have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. For example, if \( X = 5 \), the program will decompose \( X \) into \( 4 + 1 \) (i.e., \( 2^2 + 2^0 \)), and the resulting array will be `[0, 1, 2, 0]`, which does not have exactly 5 increasing subsequences.
   - **Length of the Array**:
     - The program does not check if the length of the array exceeds 200, which is a requirement of the problem.
   - **Handling Impossible Cases**:
     - The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1, which is outside the valid range but should still be checked.
     - The program does not print `-1` if it is impossible to construct the array.

8. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not ensure that the constructed array has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The program does not check if the length of the array exceeds 200.
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1 and does not print `-1` for impossible cases.

### Conclusion:
The program has several issues that could lead to incorrect results or outputs that do not meet the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not ensure that the constructed array has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, does not check if the length of the array exceeds 200, and does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1 or print `-1` for impossible cases.

Final: **False**
