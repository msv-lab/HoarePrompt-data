The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `x` from the user input, where `2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18`. If `x` is 2, it prints "1" followed by "0" and exits. Otherwise, it calculates the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to `x`, stores these lengths in a list `subseq_lens`, and determines the maximum length `mx`. It then constructs a list `ansv` containing the elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to `mx-1`. Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces. The function modifies the input `x` to 0 and updates the lists `subseq_lens` and `ansv`.
