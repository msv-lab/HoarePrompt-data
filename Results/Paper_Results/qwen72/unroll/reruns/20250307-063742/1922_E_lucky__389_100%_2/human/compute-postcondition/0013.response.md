Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is 0.
   - `mx` is the maximum length of the subsequence of powers of 2 that sum up to the input `x`.
   - `subseq_lens` is a list of the lengths of these subsequences.
   - `ansv` is a list containing the elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to `mx-1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - Since `x` is 0, the only subsequence of powers of 2 that sums up to 0 is the empty subsequence.
   - The length of the empty subsequence is 0.
   - Therefore, `mx` (the maximum length of the subsequence) is 0.
   - `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of these subsequences. Since the only subsequence is the empty subsequence, `subseq_lens` will be `[0]`.

3. **Constructing `ansv`:**
   - `ansv` is a list containing the elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to `mx-1`.
   - Given that `mx` is 0, the range from index 1 to `mx-1` is from index 1 to index -1.
   - This range is invalid and will result in an empty list.

4. **Executing the `print` Statement:**
   - The `print` statement will print the length of `ansv`.
   - Since `ansv` is an empty list, its length is 0.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **0**
