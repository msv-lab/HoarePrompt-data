You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `test_cases` is a list of integers, each representing a value of X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18).
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program does not return any value.
    #State: `mx` is 0, `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of integers, each representing a value of X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), `x` is an input integer, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, and `x` is not equal to 2.
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: `mx` is the maximum length of the subsequence of powers of 2 that sum up to the input `x`, `subseq_lens` is a list of the lengths of these subsequences, and `x` is 0.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `mx` is the maximum length of the subsequence of powers of 2 that sum up to the input `x`, `subseq_lens` is a list of the lengths of these subsequences, `ansv` is a list containing the elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to `mx-1`.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 0
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: The values of `x`, `mx`, and `subseq_lens` remain unchanged. The loop prints the elements of `ansv` from index 0 to `mx-2` separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: [ansv[0] ansv[1] ... ansv[mx-2]] (where ansv is the list and mx is the integer determining the range of elements to be printed)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases`. `t` represents the number of test cases, and each element in `test_cases` represents a value of X. The function does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program does not return any value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
