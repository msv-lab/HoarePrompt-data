#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `test_cases` is a list of integers, each representing a value of X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18).
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program does not return any value.
    #State: `mx` is 0, `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of integers, each representing a value of X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), `x` is an input integer, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, and `x` is not equal to 2.
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: `mx` is the maximum length of the subsequence of powers of 2 that sum up to the input `x`, `subseq_lens` is a list of the lengths of these subsequences, and `x` is 0.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `mx` is the maximum length of the subsequence of powers of 2 that sum up to the input `x`, `subseq_lens` is a list of the lengths of these subsequences, `ansv` is a list containing the elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to `mx-1`.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 0
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: The values of `x`, `mx`, and `subseq_lens` remain unchanged. The loop prints the elements of `ansv` from index 0 to `mx-2` separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: [ansv[0] ansv[1] ... ansv[mx-2]] (where ansv is the list and mx is the integer determining the range of elements to be printed)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `x` from the user input, where `2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18`. If `x` is 2, it prints "1" followed by "0" and exits. Otherwise, it calculates the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to `x`, stores these lengths in a list `subseq_lens`, and determines the maximum length `mx`. It then constructs a list `ansv` containing the elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to `mx-1`. Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces. The function modifies the input `x` to 0 and updates the lists `subseq_lens` and `ansv`.
