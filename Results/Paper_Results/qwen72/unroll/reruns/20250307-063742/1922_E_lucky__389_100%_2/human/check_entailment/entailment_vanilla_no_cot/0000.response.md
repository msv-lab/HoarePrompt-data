Correctness: **False**

The program provided has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of X = 2**: The program correctly handles the case when \( X = 2 \) by printing a single element array. However, the logic for other values of \( X \) is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Subsequence Calculation**: The program attempts to decompose \( X \) into powers of 2, but it does not correctly handle the decomposition. Specifically, the loop `while 2 ** i <= x:` should be `while 2 ** i <= x:` and the condition `if i == 0:` should never be true because \( i \) is always incremented before the check.

3. **Incorrect Array Construction**: The program constructs the array `ansv` by appending the indices of the subsequence lengths, which does not ensure that the array has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The array should be constructed in a way that the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \).

4. **Handling of \( X \) Values**: The program does not correctly handle cases where \( X \) is a power of 2 or other values. It should ensure that the array length is at most 200 and that the array elements are within the specified range.

5. **Output Format**: The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to find the required array, and it does not print `-1` when necessary.

To correct the program, we need to ensure that the array construction logic correctly generates an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, and we should handle the impossible cases properly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_array_with_x_subsequences(x):
    if x == 1:
        return -1  # Impossible to have exactly 1 increasing subsequence with non-empty array
    if x == 2:
        return [0]  # Single element array with 2 increasing subsequences (empty and [0])
    
    # Decompose x into powers of 2
    subseq_lens = []
    while x > 0:
        i = int(math.log2(x))
        subseq_lens.append(i)
        x -= 2 ** i
    
    # Construct the array
    ansv = []
    for i in subseq_lens:
        ansv.extend([i] * (i + 1))
    
    # Ensure the array length does not exceed 200
    if len(ansv) > 200:
        return -1
    
    return ansv

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        result = find_array_with_x_subsequences(x)
        if result == -1:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(len(result))
            print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

This corrected program:
- Handles the case where \( X = 1 \) correctly by returning `-1`.
- Decomposes \( X \) into powers of 2 and constructs the array accordingly.
- Ensures the array length does not exceed 200.
- Prints the array in the correct format.
