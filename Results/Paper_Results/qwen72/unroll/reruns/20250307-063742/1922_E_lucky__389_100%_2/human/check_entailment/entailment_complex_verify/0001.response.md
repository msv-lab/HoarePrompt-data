### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires constructing an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should print `-1`.

2. **Approach in the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - The function `func_1` is called to handle each test case.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the integer \( X \).
   - If \( X \) is 2, it prints a single element array `[0]` and returns.
   - For other values of \( X \), it tries to decompose \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2.
   - It keeps track of the lengths of these subsequences in the list `subseq_lens`.
   - It then constructs an array `ansv` based on these lengths.

4. **Decomposition of \( X \)**:
   - The program uses a loop to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( X \) and subtracts it from \( X \).
   - This process continues until \( X \) becomes 0.
   - The lengths of these subsequences are stored in `subseq_lens`.

5. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The program constructs an array `ansv` where the first \( mx \) elements are a sequence from 0 to \( mx-1 \).
   - It then appends the elements from `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv`.

7. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Handling \( X = 2 \)**: The program correctly handles the case when \( X \) is 2 by printing a single element array `[0]`.
   - **Decomposition of \( X \)**: The decomposition of \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2 is a valid approach. This ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).
   - **Constructing the Array**:
     - The program constructs the array `ansv` by first creating a sequence from 0 to \( mx-1 \) and then appending the lengths from `subseq_lens`.
     - This approach ensures that the array has the correct number of increasing subsequences.
   - **Length Constraint**:
     - The program does not explicitly check if the length of the array exceeds 200. However, the maximum length of `subseq_lens` is determined by the number of powers of 2 needed to sum up to \( X \), which is at most \( \log_2(X) \). For \( X \le 10^{18} \), \( \log_2(10^{18}) \approx 60 \), which is well within the 200 limit.
   - **Handling \( X = 1 \)**:
     - The problem statement explicitly states \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \), so \( X = 1 \) is not a valid input. The program does not need to handle this case.
   - **Printing `-1`**:
     - The program does not print `-1` if it is impossible to construct the array. However, given the constraints and the approach, it is always possible to construct an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment identified potential issues, but upon closer inspection, these issues are not critical given the problem constraints and the approach taken by the program. The program correctly handles the valid range of \( X \) and ensures that the array length does not exceed 200. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
