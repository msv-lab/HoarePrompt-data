The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 2. However, the condition for the loop to execute is that `x` must not be equal to 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `x` is not equal to 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`mx` is 0, `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of integers, each representing a value of X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be equal to 0, `subseq_lens` is an empty list**
