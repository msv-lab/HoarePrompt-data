You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Program:
import math

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if x == 2:
        print(1)
        print(0)
        return
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `x` from the user input, where `2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18`. If `x` is 2, it prints "1" followed by "0" and exits. Otherwise, it calculates the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to `x`, stores these lengths in a list `subseq_lens`, and determines the maximum length `mx`. It then constructs a list `ansv` containing the elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to `mx-1`. Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces. The function modifies the input `x` to 0 and updates the lists `subseq_lens` and `ansv`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where `X` is a power of 2. For example, if `X = 4`, the program will output an incorrect array. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Powers of 2**:
   - When `X` is a power of 2, the program will subtract the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `X` and append the corresponding index to `subseq_lens`.
   - For `X = 4`, the program will subtract `2^2 = 4` and append `2` to `subseq_lens`. This leaves `X` as 0, and the program will print the array `[0, 1, 2]`.
   - However, the array `[0, 1, 2]` has 7 increasing subsequences: `[], [0], [1], [2], [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2]`, which is not equal to 4.

2. **Incorrect Subsequence Count**:
   - The program does not correctly count the number of increasing subsequences for the constructed array. The logic for constructing the array and counting subsequences is flawed.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the edge case where `X` is 1. The problem description specifies that `X` can be as low as 2, but the program should still correctly handle the case where `X` is 1, even though it is not in the input range.

To correct the program, the logic for constructing the array and counting the increasing subsequences needs to be revised to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X` for all valid inputs.
