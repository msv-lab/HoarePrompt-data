### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to construct an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should print `-1`.

2. **Approach in the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - The function `func_1` is called to handle each test case.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the integer \( X \).
   - If \( X \) is 2, it prints a single element array `[0]` and returns.
   - For other values of \( X \), it tries to decompose \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2.
   - It keeps track of the lengths of these subsequences in the list `subseq_lens`.
   - It then constructs an array `ansv` based on these lengths.

4. **Decomposition of \( X \)**:
   - The program uses a loop to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( X \) and subtracts it from \( X \).
   - This process continues until \( X \) becomes 0.
   - The lengths of these subsequences are stored in `subseq_lens`.

5. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The program constructs an array `ansv` where the first \( mx \) elements are a sequence from 0 to \( mx-1 \).
   - It then appends the elements from `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv`.

7. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Handling \( X = 2 \)**: The program correctly handles the case when \( X \) is 2 by printing a single element array `[0]`.
   - **Decomposition of \( X \)**: The program correctly decomposes \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2, which is a valid approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of powers of 2.
   - **Constructing the Array**: The constructed array `ansv` should have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. However, the way the array is constructed has a potential issue:
     - The program constructs the array by appending the lengths of the subsequences found during decomposition. This approach does not guarantee that the array will have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
     - For example, if \( X = 5 \), the program decomposes \( X \) into \( 2^2 + 2^0 \) and constructs the array `[0, 2]`. This array does not have exactly 5 increasing subsequences.
   - **Length of the Array**: The program does not ensure that the length of the array does not exceed 200, which is a requirement of the problem.
   - **Handling Impossible Cases**: The program does not print `-1` if it is impossible to construct the array. For example, if \( X \) is a large number that cannot be represented by an array of length at most 200, the program should print `-1`.

8. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Array Construction**: The array construction logic is flawed. The program should ensure that the constructed array has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - **Length Check**: The program should check if the length of the array exceeds 200 and print `-1` if it does.
   - **Impossible Cases**: The program should handle cases where \( X \) is outside the valid range or where it is impossible to construct the array.

### Conclusion:
The program has several issues that could lead to incorrect results or outputs that do not meet the problem's requirements. Specifically, the array construction logic is flawed, it does not ensure the length of the array does not exceed 200, and it does not handle impossible cases correctly.

Final: **False**
