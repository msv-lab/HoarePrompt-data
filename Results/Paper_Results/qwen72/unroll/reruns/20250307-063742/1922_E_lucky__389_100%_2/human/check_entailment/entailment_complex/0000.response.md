Reasoning:  
The program is not correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided. Here are the issues:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters**: The function `func_1` is defined without any parameters, but it should accept the number of test cases and the list of test cases as parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):`.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program only processes one test case at a time. The loop `for _ in range(t):` should call `func_1` with the appropriate test case value. However, the function `func_1` is called without any arguments, which is incorrect.

3. **Output for X = 2**: For `x = 2`, the program prints `1` followed by `0`. This is incorrect because the array `[0]` has exactly 1 increasing subsequence, not 2. The correct output should be an array of length 2, such as `[0, 1]`.

4. **Subsequence Length Calculation**: The program attempts to decompose `x` into a sum of powers of 2 and store the lengths of these subsequences in `subseq_lens`. However, the construction of the array `ansv` is flawed. The list comprehension `ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]` creates a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1`, which does not necessarily form the required array with exactly `x` increasing subsequences.

5. **Array Construction**: The program appends elements from `subseq_lens` to `ansv` starting from index 1, which is incorrect. The array should be constructed such that it has exactly `x` increasing subsequences. The current logic does not ensure this.

6. **Output Format**: The program prints the length of `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv`. However, the elements of `ansv` are not guaranteed to be in the correct range `[-10^9, 10^9]` and may not form the required array.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
