You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `x` from the user input, where `2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18`. If `x` is 2, it prints "1" followed by "0" and exits. Otherwise, it calculates the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to `x`, stores these lengths in a list `subseq_lens`, and determines the maximum length `mx`. It then constructs a list `ansv` containing the elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to `mx-1`. Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces. The function modifies the input `x` to 0 and updates the lists `subseq_lens` and `ansv`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to construct an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should print `-1`.

2. **Approach in the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - The function `func_1` is called to handle each test case.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the integer \( X \).
   - If \( X \) is 2, it prints a single element array `[0]` and returns.
   - For other values of \( X \), it tries to decompose \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2.
   - It keeps track of the lengths of these subsequences in the list `subseq_lens`.
   - It then constructs an array `ansv` based on these lengths.

4. **Decomposition of \( X \)**:
   - The program uses a loop to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( X \) and subtracts it from \( X \).
   - This process continues until \( X \) becomes 0.
   - The lengths of these subsequences are stored in `subseq_lens`.

5. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The program constructs an array `ansv` where the first \( mx \) elements are a sequence from 0 to \( mx-1 \).
   - It then appends the elements from `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv`.

7. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the case when \( X \) is 2 by printing a single element array `[0]`.
   - For other values of \( X \), it decomposes \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2, which is a valid approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of powers of 2.
   - The constructed array `ansv` should have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, but there is a potential issue with the way the array is constructed.
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1, which should be impossible as the problem states \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \).
   - The program does not check if the length of the array exceeds 200, which is a requirement of the problem.

8. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1, which is outside the valid range but should still be checked.
   - The program does not ensure that the length of the array does not exceed 200.
   - The program does not print `-1` if it is impossible to construct the array.

### Conclusion:
The program has several issues that could lead to incorrect results or outputs that do not meet the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1 and does not ensure the length of the array does not exceed 200. Additionally, it does not print `-1` if it is impossible to construct the array.
