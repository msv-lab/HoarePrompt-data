You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', end=' ')
            print(i)
        print(' ')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', end=' ')
            print(i)
        
        print(' ')
        
    #State: `t` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `t` is between 1 and 50, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the input, where `n` is between 2 and 10^3. The function then prints a sequence for each `n`, where each line starts with '1' followed by the integer `i` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that `t` is 0 and `n` is the last integer read for the final test case. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to choose \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \).
   - It then prints \( n \) points, all of which have the same \( x \)-coordinate (1) and different \( y \)-coordinates ranging from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Evaluating the Output:**
   - The program outputs points of the form \((1, i)\) for \( i \) in the range from 1 to \( n \).
   - This means all points are on the first row of the grid.

4. **Manhattan Distances:**
   - The Manhattan distance between any two points \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) is \( |1 - 1| + |i - j| = |i - j| \).
   - The set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) will be \(\{ |i - j| \mid 1 \le i, j \le n \}\).

5. **Distinct Distances:**
   - The possible values of \( |i - j| \) range from 0 to \( n-1 \).
   - Therefore, the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain \( n \) distinct values: \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\).

6. **Maximizing the Set \(\mathcal{H}\):**
   - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \( n \), which is the maximum possible size for \( n \) points in an \( n \times n \) grid.
   - This is because the maximum number of distinct distances between \( n \) points in a grid is \( n \).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly outputs a set of points that maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for any given \( n \).
