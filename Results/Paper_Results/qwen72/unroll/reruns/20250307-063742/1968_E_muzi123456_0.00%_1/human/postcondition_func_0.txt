The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `t` is between 1 and 50, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the input, where `n` is between 2 and 10^3. The function then prints a sequence for each `n`, where each line starts with '1' followed by the integer `i` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that `t` is 0 and `n` is the last integer read for the final test case. The function does not return any value.
