The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases. The function is expected to process `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50. For each test case, the function processes an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. The function returns the results of these test cases, but the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. For each test case, it processes an integer `n` between 2 and 10^3, and returns the results of these test cases.**
