The value of `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. After the code execution, `t` is now a specific integer within the range 1 to 50, and the condition for `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer within the range 1 to 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.**
