Correctness: **False**

The given program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. The program simply prints the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), ..., \((1, n)\) for each test case. This arrangement will only produce a limited set of Manhattan distances, specifically the distances will be \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\), which is not the maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the points should be chosen in a way that maximizes the variety of Manhattan distances. For example, a better approach would be to place points along the diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the grid, or to use a more sophisticated pattern that ensures a wide range of distances.

Here is a corrected version of the program that aims to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\):

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i <= n // 2:
                print(i, 1)
            else:
                print(n, i - n // 2)
```

This program places the first half of the points along the first column and the second half along the last row, which should help in maximizing the number of distinct Manhattan distances. However, this is just one possible approach, and there might be other configurations that also maximize \(\mathcal{H}\).
