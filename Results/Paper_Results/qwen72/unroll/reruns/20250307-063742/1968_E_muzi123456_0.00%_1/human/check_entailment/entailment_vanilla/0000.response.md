### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to choose \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \).
   - It then prints \( n \) points, all of which have the same \( x \)-coordinate (1) and different \( y \)-coordinates ranging from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Evaluating the Output:**
   - The program outputs points of the form \((1, i)\) for \( i \) in the range from 1 to \( n \).
   - This means all points are on the first row of the grid.

4. **Manhattan Distances:**
   - The Manhattan distance between any two points \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) is \( |1 - 1| + |i - j| = |i - j| \).
   - The set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) will be \(\{ |i - j| \mid 1 \le i, j \le n \}\).

5. **Distinct Distances:**
   - The possible values of \( |i - j| \) range from 0 to \( n-1 \).
   - Therefore, the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain \( n \) distinct values: \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\).

6. **Maximizing the Set \(\mathcal{H}\):**
   - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \( n \), which is the maximum possible size for \( n \) points in an \( n \times n \) grid.
   - This is because the maximum number of distinct distances between \( n \) points in a grid is \( n \).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly outputs a set of points that maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for any given \( n \).
