Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case by reading the integer \(n\).

For each test case, the program outputs \(n\) points, all of which are in the first row of the grid, with the \(y\)-coordinates ranging from 1 to \(n\). This means the points are \((1,1), (1,2), \ldots, (1,n)\).

The Manhattan distance between any two points \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) is \(|1-1| + |i-j| = |i-j|\). Since \(i\) and \(j\) range from 1 to \(n\), the possible values of \(|i-j|\) are all integers from 0 to \(n-1\). This means the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain all integers from 0 to \(n-1\), which is the maximum possible size for \(\mathcal{H}\) in an \(n \times n\) grid.

However, the program has a minor issue: it prints an extra space at the end of each test case, which is not necessary according to the problem statement. This does not affect the correctness of the solution in terms of the logic and the output, but it is not strictly adhering to the output format.

Despite this minor issue, the program's logic is correct and it does maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) as required.

Correctness: **True**
