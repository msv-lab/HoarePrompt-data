Output State: **`t` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration until `t` becomes 0. The variable `n` will retain its last assigned value from the input, which is an integer within the range 2 to 10^3. The loop itself prints '1' followed by each integer from 1 to `n` for each test case, and then a space at the end of each test case. However, the values of `t` and `n` are the only variables that are affected by the loop, and `t` is the only one that is guaranteed to have a specific final value (0).
