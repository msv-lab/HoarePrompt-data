Reasoning:  
The program's goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program prints a sequence of points where each point has the form \((1, i)\) for \(i\) ranging from 1 to \(n\). 

Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:

1. **Manhattan Distance Calculation**:
   - For any two points \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\), the Manhattan distance is \(|1 - 1| + |i - j| = |i - j|\).
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain all possible values of \(|i - j|\) for \(1 \le i, j \le n\).

2. **Distinct Distances**:
   - The possible values of \(|i - j|\) range from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - For \(n\) points, the number of distinct distances is exactly \(n\).

3. **Maximizing the Size of \(\mathcal{H}\)**:
   - The maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n\) points is \(n\), which is achieved by the points \((1, 1), (1, 2), \ldots, (1, n)\).
   - The program correctly outputs these points for each \(n\).

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the points in the correct format, with each point on a new line and the coordinates separated by a space.
   - The program also ensures that there is no extra empty line at the end of the answer for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(n = 2\) correctly, as shown in the example.
   - The program also handles larger values of \(n\) up to \(10^3\) correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct in its approach to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) and outputs the points in the required format.

Correctness: **True**
