The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is truthy (i.e., not zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is a specific integer within the range 1 to 50. Since any integer within this range is non-zero and thus truthy, the loop will execute at least once without any adjustments.

State: **`t` is a specific integer within the range 1 to 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3**
