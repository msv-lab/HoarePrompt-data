Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all possible inputs. Specifically, the program always outputs points in the form \((1, i)\) for \(i\) ranging from 1 to \(n\). This means all points are on the same row, which results in a limited set of Manhattan distances. For example, for \(n = 3\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|1-1|+|1-2|, |1-1|+|1-3|, |1-1|+|2-3|\} = \{1, 2, 1\} = \{1, 2\}
\]
This set has a size of 2, but the problem description states that the maximum size for \(n = 3\) should be 4. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
