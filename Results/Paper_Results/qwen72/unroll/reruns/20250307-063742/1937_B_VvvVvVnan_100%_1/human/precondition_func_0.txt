The function should take three parameters: a list of integers representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n for each test case, and two lists of binary strings representing the two rows of the 2 x n grid for each test case. However, the provided function definition `def func_1():` does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n_list, row1_list, row2_list):` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n_list` is a list of integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) for each test case, `row1_list` and `row2_list` are lists of binary strings of length n for each test case, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
