The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `tree`, `n`, `k`, and `x`. `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree with `n` vertices, where `n` is a positive integer. `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `k` < `n`, and `x` is a positive integer. The function returns `True` in two cases: either the conditions where `good_components` is equal to `k` and `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x` are satisfied, or it returns `True` in another unspecified case. If neither of these conditions is met, the function returns `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a Tree object `tree` with `n` vertices, a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k` (1 <= k < n), and a positive integer `x`. It returns `True` if `good_components` is equal to `k` and `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, or in another unspecified case. If neither condition is met, it returns `False`.**
