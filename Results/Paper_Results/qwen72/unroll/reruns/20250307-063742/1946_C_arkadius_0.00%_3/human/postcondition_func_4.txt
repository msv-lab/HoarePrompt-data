The function `func_5` reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges to be removed `k` from the standard input, along with `n-1` pairs of integers representing the edges of a tree. It constructs a tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, then performs a computation using the `func_4` function on this tree, and prints the result of `func_4(tree, n, k)`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the tree object is fully constructed with the specified edges, and the result of the computation is printed to the standard output.
