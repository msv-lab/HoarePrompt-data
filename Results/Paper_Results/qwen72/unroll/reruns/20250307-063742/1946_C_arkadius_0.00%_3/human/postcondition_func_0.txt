The function `func_1` accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `s` (1 <= s <= n) representing the starting vertex, and a non-negative integer `x`. It updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each vertex in the tree. After the function concludes, `good_components` for each vertex `v` represents the number of connected components rooted at `v` that have a size of at least `x`, and `remaining_size` represents the total size of the connected components rooted at `v` that are smaller than `x`. The function returns the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the starting vertex `s`.
