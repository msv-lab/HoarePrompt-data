To determine what will be printed by the `print(func_4(tree, n, k))` statement, we need to understand the function `func_4` and the state of the variables and objects involved.

### Initial State:
- `tree` is an object representing a complete tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges.
- `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
- `k` is a variable whose value remains unchanged.
- The root of the tree is node 0.
- The parent of node 0 is set to -1.

### Function `func_4`:
Since the function `func_4` is not provided, we can only make assumptions based on the context and the typical behavior of such functions. However, we can infer that `func_4` likely performs some operation on the tree and returns a result based on the parameters `tree`, `n`, and `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Tree Structure**: The tree is a complete tree with `n` nodes, meaning every node is connected in a way that forms a valid tree structure. The root is node 0, and each node has a parent, except for node 0, whose parent is -1.
2. **Function Parameters**:
   - `tree`: This is the tree object.
   - `n`: The number of nodes in the tree.
   - `k`: A variable whose value is not specified but remains unchanged.

3. **Function Behavior**: Without the exact implementation of `func_4`, we can only describe the output in terms of what the function might return based on the given parameters. Typically, such a function might return a value related to the tree's structure, such as the height of the tree, the number of nodes at a certain depth, or some other property of the tree.

### Output:
Since the function `func_4` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact numerical value it will return. However, we can describe the output in terms of the function's expected behavior and the given parameters.

Output: **func_4(tree, n, k) (where `func_4` is a function that operates on the tree object with `n` nodes and returns a value based on the parameters `tree`, `n`, and `k`)**

This output indicates that the `print` statement will print the result of the `func_4` function, which is some value derived from the tree structure and the given parameters.
