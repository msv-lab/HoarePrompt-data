t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of sets of input data. For each set, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges to be removed, respectively. Each edge is represented by two integers v and u where 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n, indicating an edge between vertices v and u. The sum of n across all sets does not exceed 10^5.
