The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads input values `n` and `k` from the standard input, where `n` is the number of vertices in the tree and `k` is the number of edges to be removed, with the constraints 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. It also reads `n-1` pairs of integers `u` and `v` representing the edges of the tree, with the constraints 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. The function returns the result of some computation based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges to be removed `k` from the standard input, along with `n-1` pairs of integers representing the edges of a tree. It then performs some computation and returns a result based on these inputs.**
