### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Rooting:**
   - The original assessment suggests that the tree is not rooted correctly, which could lead to incorrect results. However, the `func_5` function calls `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)`, which roots the tree at vertex 0 (the first vertex in the tree). This is a valid root for the tree, and the function `root_tree_non_recursive` ensures that the tree is rooted correctly by setting the parent and children relationships for each vertex.

2. **Component Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` and `func_2` are responsible for calculating the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex. These functions correctly traverse the tree in a post-order manner, ensuring that the calculations are done from the leaves up to the root. The `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes are updated correctly based on the children's values.

3. **Binary Search:**
   - The function `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum value of `x` such that the tree can be split into components of at least size `x` after removing `k` edges. The binary search is implemented correctly, and it uses `func_3` to check if a given `x` is valid. The `func_3` function correctly checks if the number of good components is greater than or equal to `k` and if the remaining size is at least `x`.

4. **Edge Removal:**
   - The program does not explicitly remove edges but simulates the removal by calculating the number of good components and their sizes. This approach is valid because the problem is about finding the maximum `x` such that the tree can be split into components of at least size `x` after removing `k` edges, and the program correctly simulates this by checking the conditions for each possible `x`.

5. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_5` correctly handles the input, reads the number of vertices and edges, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum `x`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program does handle the tree rooting correctly, and the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are implemented in a way that correctly simulates the removal of edges and calculates the maximum component size. The program should produce the correct results for the given problem description and constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
