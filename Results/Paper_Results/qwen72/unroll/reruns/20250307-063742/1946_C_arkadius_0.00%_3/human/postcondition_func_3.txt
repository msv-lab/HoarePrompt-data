The function `func_4` accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and an integer `k` (1 ≤ k < n). It returns the largest integer value `mid` for which the function `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `True`. After the function concludes, `mid` is the largest integer value within the range [1, n] that satisfies the condition defined by `func_3`.
