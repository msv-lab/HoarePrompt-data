The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` will start at 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
