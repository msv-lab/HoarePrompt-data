Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not handle the case where the tree is not rooted correctly. The function `func_5` initializes the tree and adds edges, but it does not ensure that the tree is rooted at the correct vertex before performing the binary search in `func_4`. This can lead to incorrect results if the tree is not rooted at a vertex that allows the correct calculation of the maximum component size after removing edges.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
```
In this case, the tree is a simple path from 1 to 5. If the tree is rooted at vertex 0 (which is vertex 1 in the input), the program will not correctly calculate the maximum component size after removing one edge. The correct answer should be 2, but the program might return an incorrect result because the root is not chosen in a way that allows the correct traversal and calculation of component sizes.

To fix this, the tree should be rooted at a vertex that ensures the correct calculation of the maximum component size after removing edges. This typically involves rooting the tree at a vertex that is a centroid or a vertex that minimizes the maximum size of the resulting components.
