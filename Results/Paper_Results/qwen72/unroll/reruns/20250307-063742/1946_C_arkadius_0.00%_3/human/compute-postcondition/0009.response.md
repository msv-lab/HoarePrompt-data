Functionality: ** The function `func_3` accepts a Tree object `tree` with `n` vertices, a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k` (1 <= k < n), and a positive integer `x`. It returns `True` if the number of good components (`good_components`) is greater than `k`, or if `good_components` is equal to `k` and the remaining size (`remaining_size`) is greater than or equal to `x`. If neither of these conditions is met, it returns `False`. **
