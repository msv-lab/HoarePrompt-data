Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting**:
   - The `Tree` class and `TreeNode` class are well-defined to manage the tree structure.
   - The `add_edge` method correctly adds edges to the tree.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method correctly roots the tree and calculates the subtree sizes for each node. This is crucial for the subsequent functions to work correctly.

2. **Component Calculation**:
   - `func_1` traverses the tree in a non-recursive manner using a stack. It correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes for each node.
   - `func_2` is a recursive version of `func_1` and performs the same task. However, it is not used in the main logic, so its correctness is not directly relevant to the final output.

3. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size**:
   - `func_3` checks if it is possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has a size of at least `x`. It uses the results from `func_1` to determine this.
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the conditions in `func_3`. The binary search is correctly implemented, ensuring that the largest possible `x` is found.

4. **Input Handling and Output**:
   - `func_5` reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum `x`. The input handling is correct and matches the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the range of `n` and `k` and the structure of the tree.
   - The binary search in `func_4` ensures that the maximum `x` is found efficiently, even for large values of `n`.

6. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the program is sound. It correctly constructs the tree, roots it, and then uses a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that removing `k` edges results in connected components of at least size `x`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
