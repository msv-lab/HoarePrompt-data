Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the standard input, with the constraints 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. `tree` is a Tree object initialized with `n`. The function will still read `n-1` pairs of integers `u` and `v` representing the edges of the tree, with the constraints 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `Tree` object named `tree` with the integer `n`. The values of `n` and `k` remain the same as they were read from the standard input, and the constraints on `n` and `k` are still valid. The function will still read `n-1` pairs of integers `u` and `v` to represent the edges of the tree, and these pairs must satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n.
