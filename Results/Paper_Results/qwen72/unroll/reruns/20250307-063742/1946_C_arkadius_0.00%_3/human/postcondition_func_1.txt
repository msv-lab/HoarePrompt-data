The function `func_2` accepts a `Tree` object `tree`, an integer `v` representing a vertex in the tree, and a positive integer `x` (1 <= x <= n). It recursively traverses the tree starting from vertex `v` and calculates two values: `good_components` and `remaining_size`. `good_components` is the total number of subtrees rooted at `v` where the size of the subtree is greater than or equal to `x`, plus the sum of `good_components` from all child subtrees. `remaining_size` is the total size of all child subtrees where the size is less than `x`, plus 1 for the current vertex. The function returns these two values.
