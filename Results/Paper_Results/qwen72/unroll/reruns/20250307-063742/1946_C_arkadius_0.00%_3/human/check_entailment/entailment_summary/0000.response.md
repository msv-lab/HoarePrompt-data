### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting**:
   - `func_5` reads the input and constructs the tree using the `Tree` class.
   - It uses `root_tree_non_recursive` to root the tree at vertex 0. This function correctly sets the parent and children relationships and calculates the subtree sizes for each vertex.

2. **Binary Search for Maximum `x`**:
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that the tree can be split into connected components of at least size `x` by removing exactly `k` edges.
   - The binary search range is from 1 to `n`, and it uses `func_3` to check if a given `x` is valid.

3. **Validation of `x`**:
   - `func_3` uses `func_1` to determine the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree when `x` is the minimum size for a good component.
   - `func_1` performs a non-recursive post-order traversal of the tree, updating the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes for each vertex.
   - `func_3` returns `True` if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if it is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.

4. **Recursive Traversal (Alternative)**:
   - `func_2` is a recursive version of the traversal logic used in `func_1`. It calculates the same `good_components` and `remaining_size` values.
   - However, `func_2` is not used in the main logic of the program, so its correctness is not directly relevant to the overall program.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The main function `func_5` constructs the tree, roots it, and then uses `func_4` to find the maximum `x`.
   - The binary search in `func_4` ensures that the maximum `x` is found efficiently.
   - The validation in `func_3` and the traversal in `func_1` correctly implement the logic to count good components and remaining sizes.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum `x` such that the tree can be split into connected components of at least size `x` by removing exactly `k` edges. The use of non-recursive traversal in `func_1` and the binary search in `func_4` ensures that the solution is both correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
