You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges to be removed `k` from the standard input, along with `n-1` pairs of integers representing the edges of a tree. It constructs a tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, then performs a computation using the `func_4` function on this tree, and prints the result of `func_4(tree, n, k)`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the tree object is fully constructed with the specified edges, and the result of the computation is printed to the standard output.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a tree with `n` vertices and need to find the maximum number `x` such that after removing exactly `k` edges, the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`.
   - The tree is represented as an adjacency list, and we need to perform a depth-first search (DFS) to determine the sizes of the connected components after edge removals.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program consists of five functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5`.
   - `func_5` handles the input and output, and it calls `func_4` to find the maximum `x`.
   - `func_4` uses binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
   - `func_3` checks if a given `x` is valid by calling `func_1`.
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are both used to perform a DFS on the tree to count the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function performs a DFS using a stack to avoid recursion.
     - It calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree rooted at vertex `s`.
     - The function correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function also performs a DFS but uses recursion.
     - It calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree rooted at vertex `v`.
     - The function correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
   - **`func_3`**:
     - This function checks if a given `x` is valid by calling `func_1` on the tree.
     - It returns `True` if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if the number of good components is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.
     - The logic is correct for determining the validity of `x`.
   - **`func_4`**:
     - This function uses binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
     - It sets the initial search range from `1` to `n` and narrows it down based on the result of `func_3`.
     - The binary search logic is correct.
   - **`func_5`**:
     - This function handles the input and output.
     - It reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges to remove `k`.
     - It constructs the tree and roots it at vertex `0`.
     - It then calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum `x`.
     - The input handling and tree construction are correct.

4. **Tree Class**:
   - The `Tree` class is not provided in the code, but it is assumed to have methods for adding edges and rooting the tree.
   - The `Tree` class should have a structure that allows for the DFS operations performed by `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - The `Tree` class should also have attributes for `vertices`, `children`, `good_components`, and `remaining_size`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k` is less than `n` and the constraints are within the given limits.
   - The binary search ensures that the maximum `x` is found efficiently.

6. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum `x` such that after removing `k` edges, the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`.
   - The DFS and binary search algorithms are correctly used to achieve the desired result.

Correctness: **True**
