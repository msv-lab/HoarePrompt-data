### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number `x` such that after removing exactly `k` edges from a tree with `n` vertices, each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The tree is represented as an adjacency list, and we need to perform a depth-first search (DFS) to determine the sizes of the connected components after edge removals.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program consists of five functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5`.
   - `func_5` handles the input and output, and it calls `func_4` to find the maximum `x`.
   - `func_4` uses binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
   - `func_3` checks if a given `x` is valid by calling `func_1`.
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are both used to perform a DFS on the tree to count the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function performs a DFS using a stack to avoid recursion.
     - It correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
     - The function ensures that the DFS is performed in a non-recursive manner, which is important for large trees to avoid stack overflow.
   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function also performs a DFS but uses recursion.
     - It correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
     - The recursive DFS is used to validate the non-recursive DFS (`func_1`), ensuring that the results are consistent.
   - **`func_3`**:
     - This function checks if a given `x` is valid by calling `func_1` on the tree.
     - It returns `True` if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if the number of good components is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.
     - The logic is correct for determining the validity of `x`.
   - **`func_4`**:
     - This function uses binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
     - It sets the initial search range from `1` to `n` and narrows it down based on the result of `func_3`.
     - The binary search logic is correct and ensures that the maximum `x` is found efficiently.
   - **`func_5`**:
     - This function handles the input and output.
     - It reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges to remove `k`.
     - It constructs the tree and roots it at vertex `0`.
     - It then calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum `x`.
     - The input handling and tree construction are correct.

4. **Tree Class**:
   - The `Tree` class is not provided in the code, but it is assumed to have methods for adding edges and rooting the tree.
   - The `Tree` class should have a structure that allows for the DFS operations performed by `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - The `Tree` class should also have attributes for `vertices`, `children`, `good_components`, and `remaining_size`.
   - The assumption that the `Tree` class is correctly implemented is reasonable given the context.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k` is less than `n` and the constraints are within the given limits.
   - The binary search ensures that the maximum `x` is found efficiently, even for large values of `n`.

6. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum `x` such that after removing `k` edges, the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`.
   - The DFS and binary search algorithms are correctly used to achieve the desired result.
   - The non-recursive DFS (`func_1`) and the recursive DFS (`func_2`) are consistent, which adds to the robustness of the solution.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the required logic and handles the problem as described.

Final: **True**
