### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0, which is appropriate for the problem since the signs start occurring from year 0.

3. **Loop for Calculating the Year:**
   - The loop iterates over each periodicity in `nums`.
   - The expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is strictly after the previous sign's occurrence.
   - This expression works by finding the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, `start_year` contains the year in which the last sign (the n-th sign) will occur.
   - The function prints this value, which is the correct output for the given problem.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where all periodicities are 1 correctly. In this case, the signs will occur in consecutive years, and the final year will be `n`.
   - The function also handles the case where the periodicities are large and the signs occur infrequently, ensuring that the correct year is calculated.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The input and output handling is also correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
