Reasoning:

The program aims to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that the signs must occur sequentially and each sign occurs every a_i years. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of signs and the periodicities of the signs. It then calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

The key logic in the program is the loop that updates `start_year` for each sign. The expression `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that the next year in which the sign occurs is strictly after the previous sign. This is done by dividing `start_year` by the current sign's periodicity `nums[x]`, adding 1 to the quotient to ensure the next occurrence, and then multiplying back by `nums[x]` to get the next multiple of `nums[x]`.

Let's break down the reasoning for the example provided:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Signs: 3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18
   - Initial `start_year` is 0.
   - For the first sign (3): `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
   - For the second sign (2): `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
   - For the third sign (4): `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
   - For the fourth sign (5): `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
   - For the fifth sign (9): `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
   - For the sixth sign (18): `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Signs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
   - Initial `start_year` is 0.
   - For the first sign (1): `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
   - For the second sign (2): `start_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
   - For the third sign (3): `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
   - For the fourth sign (4): `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
   - For the fifth sign (5): `start_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Signs: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
   - Initial `start_year` is 0.
   - For the first sign (1): `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
   - For the second sign (1): `start_year = (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
   - For the third sign (1): `start_year = (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
   - For the fourth sign (1): `start_year = (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
   - For the fifth sign (1): `start_year = (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Signs: 50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006
   - Initial `start_year` is 0.
   - For the first sign (50): `start_year = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
   - For the second sign (30): `start_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
   - For the third sign (711): `start_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
   - For the fourth sign (200): `start_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`
   - For the fifth sign (503): `start_year = (800 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
   - For the sixth sign (1006): `start_year = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`

The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The logic and the output match the problem description and the example provided.

Correctness: **True**
