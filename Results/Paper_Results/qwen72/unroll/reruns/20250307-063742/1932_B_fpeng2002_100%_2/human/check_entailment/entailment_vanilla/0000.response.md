To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and the program step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - The first line contains the number of signs, `n`.
     - The second line contains `n` integers, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, representing the periodicities of the signs.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

3. **Logic:**
   - The signs occur sequentially, and the `i`-th sign occurs every `a_i` years.
   - After the `i`-th sign occurs, the tribe starts waiting for the `(i+1)`-th sign from the next year.
   - We need to find the year in which all signs occur sequentially.

### Program Analysis:
The program is structured as follows:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases, `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs, `n`, and the periodicities of the signs, `nums`.

2. **Calculating the Year:**
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, it updates `start_year` to the next year in which the sign occurs.
   - The update is done using the formula: `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

3. **Output:**
   - It prints the final `start_year` for each test case.

### Detailed Reasoning:
- **Initialization:**
  - `start_year` is initialized to 0, which represents the starting year.

- **Loop Through Signs:**
  - For each sign, the program calculates the next year in which the sign occurs.
  - The formula `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`.

- **Correctness of the Formula:**
  - `start_year // nums[x]` gives the number of complete cycles of `nums[x]` that have occurred by `start_year`.
  - Adding 1 to this quotient ensures that we move to the next cycle.
  - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the year of the next occurrence of the sign.

- **Sequential Occurrence:**
  - The formula ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous sign, as required by the problem statement.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `n = 1` correctly.
  - The program also handles the case where all periodicities are 1, which results in the `n`-th sign occurring in the `n`-th year.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `n = 6`, `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - `start_year = 0`
   - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
   - After the second sign: `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
   - After the third sign: `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
   - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
   - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
   - After the sixth sign: `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `n = 5`, `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - `start_year = 0`
   - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
   - After the second sign: `start_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
   - After the third sign: `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
   - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
   - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
   - Output: `5` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `n = 5`, `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - `start_year = 0`
   - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
   - After the second sign: `start_year = (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
   - After the third sign: `start_year = (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
   - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
   - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`
   - Output: `5` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - `n = 6`, `nums = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
   - `start_year = 0`
   - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
   - After the second sign: `start_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
   - After the third sign: `start_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
   - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`
   - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (800 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
   - After the sixth sign: `start_year = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
   - Output: `2012` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens, as per the problem description. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
