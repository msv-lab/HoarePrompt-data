Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the signs occur with a periodicity of 1. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
3
1 1 1
```

According to the problem description, the signs must occur sequentially. The first sign occurs in the 1st year, the second sign must occur strictly after the 1st year, so it should occur in the 2nd year, and the third sign must occur strictly after the 2nd year, so it should occur in the 3rd year. Therefore, the output should be 3.

However, the program will output 1, which is incorrect. The issue lies in the line `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This line does not correctly handle the case where the periodicity is 1 and the signs must occur strictly after the previous sign. It should instead ensure that the next sign occurs in the next year after the previous sign.
