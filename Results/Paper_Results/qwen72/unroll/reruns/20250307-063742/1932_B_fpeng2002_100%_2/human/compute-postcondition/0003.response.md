The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The function returns a result based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 1,000,000. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.**
