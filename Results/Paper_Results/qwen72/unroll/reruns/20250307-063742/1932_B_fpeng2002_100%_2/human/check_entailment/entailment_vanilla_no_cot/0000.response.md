Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Test Case Processing**: For each test case:
   - It reads the number of signs (`n`).
   - It reads the periodicities of the signs (`nums`).
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0, which will keep track of the year in which the signs occur.
3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign**:
   - For each sign, the program calculates the next occurrence of the sign after the previous sign has occurred.
   - This is done using the formula `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is strictly after the previous sign.
4. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

The logic ensures that the signs occur sequentially and that the year for each sign is the smallest possible year strictly after the previous sign has occurred. This matches the problem description and the example provided. Therefore, the program is correct.
