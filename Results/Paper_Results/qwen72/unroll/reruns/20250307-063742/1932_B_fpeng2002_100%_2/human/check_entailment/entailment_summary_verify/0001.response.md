### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step by step to ensure the program's correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs, `n`, and the periodicities of the signs, `nums`.

2. **Calculating the Year:**
   - The program initializes `start_year` to 0, which is the starting year.
   - It then iterates through each sign's periodicity in `nums` and updates `start_year` to the next year in which the sign occurs.
   - The formula `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`.

3. **Sequential Occurrence:**
   - The formula `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous sign. This is because:
     - `start_year // nums[x]` gives the number of complete cycles of `nums[x]` that have occurred by `start_year`.
     - Adding 1 to this quotient ensures that we move to the next cycle.
     - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the year of the next occurrence of the sign, which is strictly after the current `start_year`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n = 1` correctly. For a single sign, the year of the first occurrence is simply the periodicity of that sign.
   - The program also handles the case where all periodicities are 1, which results in the `n`-th sign occurring in the `n`-th year.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `n = 6`, `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - `start_year = 0`
   - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
   - After the second sign: `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
   - After the third sign: `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
   - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
   - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
   - After the sixth sign: `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `n = 5`, `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - `start_year = 0`
   - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
   - After the second sign: `start_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
   - After the third sign: `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
   - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
   - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
   - Output: `5` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `n = 5`, `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - `start_year = 0`
   - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
   - After the second sign: `start_year = (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
   - After the third sign: `start_year = (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
   - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
   - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`
   - Output: `5` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - `n = 6`, `nums = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
   - `start_year = 0`
   - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
   - After the second sign: `start_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
   - After the third sign: `start_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
   - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`
   - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (800 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
   - After the sixth sign: `start_year = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
   - Output: `2012` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens, as per the problem description. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Final: **True**
