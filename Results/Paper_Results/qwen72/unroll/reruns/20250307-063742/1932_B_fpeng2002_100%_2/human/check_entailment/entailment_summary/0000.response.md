Reasoning:
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.

2. **Calculating the Year**: For each sign, the program calculates the next year in which the sign will occur after the previous sign. This is done using the formula:
   \[
   \text{start_year} = (\text{start_year} // \text{nums}[x] + 1) * \text{nums}[x]
   \]
   This formula ensures that `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to the current `start_year`.

3. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final value of `start_year`, which should be the year when the n-th sign occurs.

Let's analyze the correctness of the program based on the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `3 2 4 5 9 18`
  - Start year: 0
  - First sign: 3 (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3
  - Second sign: 4 (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4
  - Third sign: 8 (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8
  - Fourth sign: 10 (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10
  - Fifth sign: 18 (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18
  - Sixth sign: 36 (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36
  - Output: 36 (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `1 2 3 4 5`
  - Start year: 0
  - First sign: 1 (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1
  - Second sign: 2 (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2
  - Third sign: 3 (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3
  - Fourth sign: 4 (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4
  - Fifth sign: 5 (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5
  - Output: 5 (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1 1 1`
  - Start year: 0
  - First sign: 1 (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1
  - Second sign: 2 (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2
  - Third sign: 3 (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3
  - Fourth sign: 4 (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4
  - Fifth sign: 5 (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5
  - Output: 5 (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
  - Start year: 0
  - First sign: 50 (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50
  - Second sign: 60 (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60
  - Third sign: 1422 (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 1422
  - Fourth sign: 1600 (1422 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 1600
  - Fifth sign: 2012 (1600 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 2012
  - Sixth sign: 2012 (2012 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012
  - Output: 2012 (Correct)

The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case. The logic ensures that the signs occur sequentially and the year is the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than or equal to the year of the previous sign.

Correctness: **True**
