Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` remains a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and `start_year` is the smallest integer that is a multiple of all integers in the list `nums` for the last iteration of the loop.**

### Explanation:
- **`num_tests`**: The loop decrements `num_tests` by 1 in each iteration. After all iterations, `num_tests` will be 0.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` is read from input in each iteration of the loop, so it remains an integer within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) for each test case.
- **`a`**: The list `a` is not modified within the loop, so it remains unchanged.
- **`start_year`**: The variable `start_year` is updated in each iteration of the inner loop to be the smallest multiple of all integers in the list `nums` for the current test case. After the loop finishes, `start_year` will hold the result for the last test case.
