You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program: 
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())

        print(start_year)
        
    #State: `num_tests` is 0, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` remains a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and `start_year` is the smallest integer that is a multiple of all integers in the list `nums` for the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It calculates the smallest integer `start_year` that is a multiple of all integers in `nums` for the last iteration of the loop and prints this value. After processing all test cases, `num_tests` is 0, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `nums` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and the program step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - The first line contains the number of signs, `n`.
     - The second line contains `n` integers, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, representing the periodicities of the signs.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

3. **Logic:**
   - The signs occur sequentially, and the `i`-th sign occurs every `a_i` years.
   - After the `i`-th sign occurs, the tribe starts waiting for the `(i+1)`-th sign from the next year.
   - We need to find the year in which all signs occur sequentially.

### Program Analysis:
The program is structured as follows:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases, `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs, `n`, and the periodicities of the signs, `nums`.

2. **Calculating the Year:**
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, it updates `start_year` to the next year in which the sign occurs.
   - The update is done using the formula: `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

3. **Output:**
   - It prints the final `start_year` for each test case.

### Detailed Reasoning:
- **Initialization:**
  - `start_year` is initialized to 0, which represents the starting year.

- **Loop Through Signs:**
  - For each sign, the program calculates the next year in which the sign occurs.
  - The formula `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`.

- **Correctness of the Formula:**
  - `start_year // nums[x]` gives the number of complete cycles of `nums[x]` that have occurred by `start_year`.
  - Adding 1 to this quotient ensures that we move to the next cycle.
  - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the year of the next occurrence of the sign.

- **Sequential Occurrence:**
  - The formula ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous sign, as required by the problem statement.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `n = 1` correctly.
  - The program also handles the case where all periodicities are 1, which results in the `n`-th sign occurring in the `n`-th year.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `n = 6`, `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - `start_year = 0`
   - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
   - After the second sign: `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
   - After the third sign: `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
   - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
   - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
   - After the sixth sign: `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `n = 5`, `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - `start_year = 0`
   - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
   - After the second sign: `start_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
   - After the third sign: `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
   - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
   - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
   - Output: `5` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `n = 5`, `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - `start_year = 0`
   - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
   - After the second sign: `start_year = (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
   - After the third sign: `start_year = (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
   - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
   - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`
   - Output: `5` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - `n = 6`, `nums = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
   - `start_year = 0`
   - After the first sign: `start_year = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
   - After the second sign: `start_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
   - After the third sign: `start_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
   - After the fourth sign: `start_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`
   - After the fifth sign: `start_year = (800 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
   - After the sixth sign: `start_year = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
   - Output: `2012` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens, as per the problem description. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the given examples.
