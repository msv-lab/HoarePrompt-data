Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It calculates the smallest integer `start_year` that is a multiple of all integers in `nums` for the last iteration of the loop and prints this value. After processing all test cases, `num_tests` is 0, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `nums` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The function does not return any value. **
