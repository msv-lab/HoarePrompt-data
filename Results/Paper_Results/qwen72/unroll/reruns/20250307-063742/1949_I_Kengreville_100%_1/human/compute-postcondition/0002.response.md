Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `x` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n` where 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `visited` and `coef` are lists of booleans and integers, respectively, with length `n`, initially set to False and None.** 

The list `y` has been updated to a list of `None` with length `n`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
