Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `y`, and `r` remain the same. `visited` may have some or all elements set to `True` depending on the `dfs` function. `coef` will have some or all elements set to `1` depending on the `dfs` function. `tot` will be the sum of all `tot` values calculated during the `dfs` calls. `bipartite` will be `True` if all `dfs` calls maintain bipartiteness, otherwise it will be `False`. If `ok` is `True`, it indicates that at least one `dfs` call maintains bipartiteness and `tot` is not zero. If `ok` is `False`, it indicates that no `dfs` call maintains bipartiteness or `tot` is zero.***
