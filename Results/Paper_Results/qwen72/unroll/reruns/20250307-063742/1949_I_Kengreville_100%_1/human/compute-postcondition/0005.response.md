Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `x` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `visited` is a list of booleans with length `n`, all set to `False`, `coef` is a list of `None` with length `n`.**

The code snippet `coef = [None] * n` reinitializes the `coef` list to be a list of `None` with length `n`. Since the initial state already specifies that `coef` is a list of `None` with length `n`, the state of `coef` remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, and `visited`) are not affected by this code snippet.
