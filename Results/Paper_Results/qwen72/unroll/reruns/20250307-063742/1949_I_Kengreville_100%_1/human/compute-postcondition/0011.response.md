The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `i` is not explicitly defined before the loop, but it will be initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The state of `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
