Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `x` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `visited` is a list of booleans with length `n`, all set to `False`, `coef` is a list of integers with length `n`, initially set to `None`.**

The code `visited = [False] * n` reassigns the `visited` list to a new list of length `n`, where each element is `False`. The other variables remain unchanged.
