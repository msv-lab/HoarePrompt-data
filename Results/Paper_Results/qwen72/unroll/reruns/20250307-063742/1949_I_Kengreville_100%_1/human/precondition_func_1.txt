i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. The variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, and `bipartite` are defined and accessible within the function scope. `x` and `y` are lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the disk centers, respectively, with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9. `r` is a list of positive integers representing the radii of the disks, with 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9. `visited` is a list of booleans indicating whether a disk has been visited, `coef` is a list of integers (1 or -1) indicating the coefficient for the disk, `tot` is an integer representing the total, and `bipartite` is a boolean indicating whether the graph is bipartite.
