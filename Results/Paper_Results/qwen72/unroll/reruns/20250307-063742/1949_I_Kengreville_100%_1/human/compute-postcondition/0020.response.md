Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and three lists `x`, `y`, and `r` of length `n` from user input. It then processes these lists to determine if a certain bipartite condition is met. The function modifies the `visited` and `coef` lists, setting some elements of `visited` to `True` and some elements of `coef` to `1`. After processing, if at least one `dfs` call maintains bipartiteness and `tot` is not zero, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final state of the program is that `n`, `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged, `visited` may have some or all elements set to `True`, `coef` may have some or all elements set to `1`, and the function does not return any value. **
