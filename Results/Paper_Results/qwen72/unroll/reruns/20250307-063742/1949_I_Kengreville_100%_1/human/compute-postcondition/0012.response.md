Output State: `n` is an integer input by the user, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of booleans with length `n`, all potentially set to `True` or `False` depending on the `dfs` function, `coef` is a list of integers with length `n`, where each element is set to `1` if the corresponding index was visited by the `dfs` function, otherwise it remains `None`, `tot` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, which is the sum of all non-zero values set by the `dfs` function, `bipartite` is `True` or `False` depending on the final state set by the `dfs` function, `ok` is `True` if at least one `dfs` call resulted in `bipartite` being `True` and `tot` being non-zero, otherwise it is `False`.
