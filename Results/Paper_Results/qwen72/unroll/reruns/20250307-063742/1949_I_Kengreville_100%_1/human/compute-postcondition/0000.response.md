Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers with length `n`, where -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. `visited` and `coef` are lists of booleans and integers, respectively, with length `n`, initially set to False and None.**
