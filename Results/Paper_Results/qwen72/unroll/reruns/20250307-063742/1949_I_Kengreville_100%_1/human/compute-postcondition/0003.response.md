Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `x` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `visited` is a list of booleans with length `n`, initially set to False, `coef` is a list of integers with length `n`, initially set to None.**

The code snippet `r = [None] * n` reassigns the variable `r` to a new list of `None` values with length `n`. The initial state specified that `r` was a list of integers with length `n`, but this has been overwritten. All other variables and their initial states remain unchanged.
