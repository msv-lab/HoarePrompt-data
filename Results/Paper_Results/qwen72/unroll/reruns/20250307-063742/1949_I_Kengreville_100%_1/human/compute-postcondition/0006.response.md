The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the default behavior of `range(n)`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` will be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
