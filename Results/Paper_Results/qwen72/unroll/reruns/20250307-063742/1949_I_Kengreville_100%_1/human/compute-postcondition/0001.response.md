Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `x` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `y` and `r` are lists of integers with length `n`, where -10^9 <= y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. `visited` and `coef` are lists of booleans and integers, respectively, with length `n`, initially set to False and None.**

The list `x` has been updated to a list of `None` values with the same length `n` as the initial lists `y` and `r`. The other variables remain unchanged.
