It seems there was a misunderstanding. The provided function `decorating_function` is not related to the problem of helping Kirill gather mushrooms to brew an elixir. Instead, it appears to be a decorator function template, which is not directly involved in solving the given problem.

However, based on the problem description, let's focus on the actual function that would be used to solve the problem. For instance, a function that might be part of the solution could look something like this:

```python
def max_elixir_strength(v, p):
    # Function to calculate the maximum strength of the elixir
    pass
```

Given this function signature and the problem description, the precondition for the variables `v` and `p` would be:

Precondition: **v is a list of integers where 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, and p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, where n is the length of v.**
