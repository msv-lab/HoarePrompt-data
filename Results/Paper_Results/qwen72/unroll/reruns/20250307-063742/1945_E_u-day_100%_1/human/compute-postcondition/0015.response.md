The function `func_3` accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos`. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `pos` is an integer that will be updated to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found. The function returns `True` if `k` is found in `arr` and updates `pos` to the index of `k`. If `k` is not found, the function returns `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos`. It returns `True` if `k` is found in `arr` and updates `pos` to the index of `k`. If `k` is not found, it returns `False`.**
