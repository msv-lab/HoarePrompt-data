### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search, with the ability to perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work correctly.
   - The binary search algorithm provided initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n`, and the loop continues until `r - l = 1`.

2. **Binary Search in a Permutation:**
   - Binary search is designed to work on sorted arrays. Since the permutation is not guaranteed to be sorted, we need to perform swaps to ensure that the binary search can find `x` correctly.
   - The binary search in `func_3` is slightly different from the standard binary search, but it follows the same basic logic.

3. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The function `func_3` reads the input, finds the position of `x` in the permutation, and then performs a binary search.
   - If the binary search finds `x` at the correct position (`arr[low] == k`), it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - If `x` is not found at the correct position, it prints `1` and the indices of the elements to swap to place `x` at the correct position.

4. **Swapping Elements:**
   - The function `func_3` only performs one swap if necessary. It swaps the element at position `low` with the element at the position where `x` is found.
   - This approach is correct because it ensures that `x` is moved to the position where the binary search expects it to be.
   - However, the function summary and the code itself do not explicitly handle the case where more than one swap might be necessary. The problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, but the current implementation only performs one swap.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.
   - Each test case is handled by calling `func_3`, which reads the input, performs the necessary operations, and prints the output.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position and needs to be swapped.
   - However, it does not handle the case where more than one swap might be necessary, which is a requirement of the problem.

7. **Constraints:**
   - The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints (up to 20,000 test cases and permutations of size up to 200,000).

### Challenging the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program correctly performs the necessary swap to ensure that the binary search finds `x` at the correct position. However, the problem explicitly states that up to 2 swaps are allowed, and the current implementation only performs one swap.
- This means that for some test cases, the program might not be able to rearrange the permutation correctly, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
- The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where more than one swap is necessary to make the binary search work correctly.

Final: **False**
