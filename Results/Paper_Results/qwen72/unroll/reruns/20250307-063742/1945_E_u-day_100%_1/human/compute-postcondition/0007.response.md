To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `low + 1 < high`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `pos` is the index of the element `k` in the list `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n`.
- `st` is an empty set.

The condition `low + 1 < high` simplifies to `1 < high`, which further simplifies to `high > 1`. Since `high` is `n`, the condition becomes `n > 1`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`pos` is the index of the element `k` in the list `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `low` is 0, `high` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 1. `st` is an empty set.**
