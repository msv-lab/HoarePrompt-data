### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` using `func_1()` and the permutation `arr` using `func_2()`.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`:**
   - The program iterates through the permutation `arr` to find the index `pos` of the element `k`.
   - If `k` is found, `pos` is set to the index where `k` is located. If not, `pos` remains `-1`.

3. **Binary Search:**
   - The program initializes `low` and `high` to `0` and `n` respectively.
   - It performs a binary search to find the position where `k` would be if the array were sorted.
   - The loop continues until `low + 1 < high`, which ensures that the search space is reduced to a single element.

4. **Output:**
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, the program prints `0` and ends the test case.
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, the program prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate a swap operation.

5. **Correctness of the Swap:**
   - The program assumes that `k` is always found in the permutation, which is guaranteed by the problem statement.
   - The swap operation is intended to move `k` to the position where the binary search would find it.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where `k` is not found in the permutation, which is not a concern since the problem guarantees `k` is in the permutation.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k` is already in the correct position by printing `0`.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k` is not in the correct position by printing `1` and the indices for the swap.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the position of `k` in the permutation and performs the necessary swap to ensure that the binary search will find `k` in the correct position. The program handles all edge cases and follows the problem constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
