Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using a binary search algorithm, with the possibility of performing up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly. Let's break down the functions and their roles:

1. **`func_1`**:
   - This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers. It is used to read the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - **Output**: An iterator of integers.
   - **Correctness**: This function is correct for its intended purpose.

2. **`func_2`**:
   - This function reads another line of input and converts it into a list of integers. It is used to read the permutation `p`.
   - **Output**: A list of integers.
   - **Correctness**: This function is correct for its intended purpose.

3. **`func_3`**:
   - This function is the main logic of the program. It reads `n` and `x` using `func_1`, and the permutation `p` using `func_2`.
   - It then searches for the index of `x` in the permutation `p` and stores it in `pos`.
   - It performs a binary search to find the position where `x` would be if the permutation were sorted.
   - If `x` is found at the correct position (`arr[low] == k`), it prints `0`.
   - If `x` is not found at the correct position, it prints `1` followed by the indices of the elements that need to be swapped to place `x` at the correct position.

### Analysis of `func_3`:
- **Binary Search**:
  - The binary search is performed to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`.
  - The binary search is implemented correctly, but it assumes that the array is sorted, which is not the case for a permutation.

- **Swapping Logic**:
  - After the binary search, if `arr[low] == k`, the function prints `0` because `x` is already in the correct position.
  - If `arr[low] != k`, the function prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to swap the elements at these positions. This is intended to place `x` at the correct position found by the binary search.

### Issues:
- **Binary Search on Unsorted Array**:
  - The binary search algorithm is designed to work on sorted arrays. Since the permutation `p` is not guaranteed to be sorted, the binary search may not always find the correct position for `x`.
  - For example, if `p = [3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]` and `x = 5`, the binary search might not correctly identify the position where `5` should be placed.

- **Swapping Logic**:
  - The function only performs one swap, but the problem allows for up to 2 swaps. The current implementation does not consider the possibility of needing a second swap to ensure the binary search works correctly.
  - For example, if `p = [4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]` and `x = 3`, the binary search might incorrectly place `3` at the wrong position, and a single swap might not be enough to correct this.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the binary search is applied to an unsorted permutation, which can lead to incorrect results. Additionally, the program does not consider the possibility of needing a second swap to ensure the binary search works correctly.

Correctness: **False**
