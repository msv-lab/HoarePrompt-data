The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the return values of the function `func_1()`. The function `func_1()` is expected to return a tuple of two integers, which will be assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer and `1 <= k <= n`, and these conditions should still hold true after the function call. The list `arr` and the variable `pos` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, and `pos` is an integer that will be updated to the index of k in arr if k is found.**
