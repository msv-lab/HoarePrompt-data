Postcondition: **`pos` is the index of the element `k` in the list `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, or `n` if no such index exists. `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, or 0 if no such index exists. `st` contains all the midpoints that were checked during the loop execution. Additionally, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.**
