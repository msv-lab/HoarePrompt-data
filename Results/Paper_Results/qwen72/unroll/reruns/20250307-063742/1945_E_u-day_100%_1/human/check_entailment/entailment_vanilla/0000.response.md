### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
   - We can perform at most 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
   - After rearranging, we perform a binary search to find the position of `x`.
   - The goal is to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

2. **Binary Search in a Permutation:**
   - Binary search works correctly only on sorted arrays. However, in this problem, we are allowed to perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work.
   - The binary search algorithm provided in the problem is slightly different from the standard binary search. It initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n`, and the loop continues until `r - l = 1`.

3. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The function `func_3` reads the input, finds the position of `x` in the permutation, and then performs a binary search.
   - If the binary search finds `x` at the correct position (`arr[low] == k`), it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - If `x` is not found at the correct position, it prints `1` and the indices of the elements to swap to place `x` at the correct position.

4. **Swapping Elements:**
   - The function `func_3` only performs one swap if necessary. It swaps the element at position `low` with the element at the position where `x` is found.
   - This approach is correct because it ensures that `x` is moved to the position where the binary search expects it to be.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.
   - Each test case is handled by calling `func_3`, which reads the input, performs the necessary operations, and prints the output.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position and needs to be swapped.

7. **Constraints:**
   - The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints (up to 20,000 test cases and permutations of size up to 200,000).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation and performs the necessary swap to ensure that the binary search finds `x` at the correct position. It adheres to the problem constraints and handles multiple test cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
