Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `pos` is the index of the element `k` in the list `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
- `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
- `k` is a specific value that we are searching for in `arr`.
- `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, or `n` if no such index exists.
- `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, or 0 if no such index exists.
- `st` contains all the midpoints that were checked during the loop execution.
- The current value of `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the integer `0`.
- The initial state provides detailed information about the variables `pos`, `n`, `k`, `low`, `high`, and `st`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the value printed is not influenced by the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **0**
