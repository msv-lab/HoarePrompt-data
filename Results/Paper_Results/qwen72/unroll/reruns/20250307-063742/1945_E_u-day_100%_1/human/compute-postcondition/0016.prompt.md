You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, and pos is an integer that will be updated to the index of k in arr if k is found.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `pos` is the index of the element `k` in the list `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `pos` is the index of the element `k` in the list `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, or `n` if no such index exists. `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, or 0 if no such index exists. `st` contains all the midpoints that were checked during the loop execution.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: (low + 1, pos + 1) (where low + 1 is the index where k would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of arr, and pos + 1 is the index of k plus 1 if k is found, or 0 if k is not found)
    #State: *`pos` is the index of the element `k` in the list `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, or `n` if no such index exists. `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, or 0 if no such index exists. `st` contains all the midpoints that were checked during the loop execution. Additionally, if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is set to `low`. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos`. It returns `True` if `k` is found in `arr` and updates `pos` to the index of `k`. If `k` is not found, it returns `False`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
