Reasoning:

The problem requires rearranging a permutation so that a binary search can correctly find a given number `x`. The binary search algorithm is performed on the permutation, and the goal is to ensure that after at most 2 swaps, the binary search will find `x` at the correct position.

Let's break down the functions and their roles:

1. **func_1()**:
   - This function reads the input and returns an iterator of integers. It is used to read the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.

2. **func_2()**:
   - This function reads the next line of input and returns a list of integers. It is used to read the permutation `arr` for each test case.

3. **func_3()**:
   - This function is the main logic for each test case. It reads `n` and `x` using `func_1()`, and reads the permutation `arr` using `func_2()`.
   - It then searches for the index of `x` in `arr` and stores it in `pos`.
   - The function performs a binary search to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= x` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > x`.
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `x`, it prints `0` (indicating no swaps are needed).
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`, it prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` (indicating one swap is needed to place `x` at the correct position).

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

- **Binary Search Initialization**:
  - The binary search initializes `low` to `0` and `high` to `n`. This is correct for a 0-indexed array.
  - The condition `low + 1 < high` is used to terminate the loop, which is also correct for a binary search.

- **Finding the Index of `x`**:
  - The function correctly finds the index of `x` in `arr` and stores it in `pos`.

- **Swapping Logic**:
  - The function prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` if `x` is not found at `low`. This is incorrect because:
    - The binary search is not guaranteed to find the correct position of `x` in an unsorted permutation.
    - The function does not handle the case where more than one swap might be needed to place `x` in the correct position.

The problem statement guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient to rearrange the permutation so that the binary search can find `x`. However, the current implementation only considers a single swap, which is not always enough to achieve the goal.

To fix this, the function should:
- Identify the correct position `low` where `x` should be placed.
- Identify the current position `pos` of `x` in the permutation.
- Perform the necessary swaps to place `x` at `low` and ensure the permutation is in a state where the binary search will find `x`.

Since the current implementation does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
