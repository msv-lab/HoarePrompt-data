You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are used in the function signature.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns an iterator that converts each element of the input string, split by spaces, into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an iterator that converts each element of the input string, split by spaces, into an integer. After the function concludes, the program has an iterator that can be used to iterate over the converted integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function `func_2` does not take any arguments.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned list, which contains the elements produced by `func_1()`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, and pos is an integer that will be updated to the index of k in arr if k is found.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `pos` is the index of the element `k` in the list `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `pos` is the index of the element `k` in the list `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, or `n` if no such index exists. `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, or 0 if no such index exists. `st` contains all the midpoints that were checked during the loop execution.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: (low + 1, pos + 1) (where low + 1 is the index where k would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of arr, and pos + 1 is the index of k plus 1 if k is found, or 0 if k is not found)
    #State: *`pos` is the index of the element `k` in the list `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, or `n` if no such index exists. `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, or 0 if no such index exists. `st` contains all the midpoints that were checked during the loop execution. Additionally, if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is set to `low`. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It initializes `n`, `k`, and `arr` by calling `func_1` and `func_2`, respectively. It then searches for the integer `k` in the list `arr` and updates `pos` to the index of `k` if found, otherwise `pos` remains -1. The function also performs a binary search to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`. If `k` is found in `arr` (i.e., `arr[low] == k`), it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the index where `k` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr` and the index of `k` plus 1 if `k` is found, or 0 if `k` is not found. The final state of the program includes `pos` being the index of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, and `st` containing all the midpoints checked during the binary search.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only performs a single swap if the binary search does not find the target value `k` at the position `low`. However, the problem statement allows for up to two swaps to ensure that the binary search will find the target value `k` at the position `low`.

Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
4 5
2 4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
2 3
```

In this case, the program only performs one swap, which is not sufficient to ensure that the binary search will find the target value `3` at the correct position. The expected output requires two swaps to rearrange the permutation so that the binary search algorithm can correctly identify the position of `3`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
