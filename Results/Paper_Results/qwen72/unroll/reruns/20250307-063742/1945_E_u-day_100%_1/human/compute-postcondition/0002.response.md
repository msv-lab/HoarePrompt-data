Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos` is -1.**

The code initializes `pos` to -1, indicating that the search for `k` in `arr` has not yet started or that `k` has not been found. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
