To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(low + 1, pos + 1)`, let's break down the initial state and the values of the variables involved:

1. **`pos`**: This is the index of the element `k` in the list `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
2. **`low`**: This is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, or `n` if no such index exists.
3. **`high`**: This is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, or 0 if no such index exists.
4. **`st`**: This contains all the midpoints that were checked during the loop execution.
5. **`arr[low]` is not equal to `k`**: This is an additional condition that helps us understand the relationship between `low` and `k`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the possible values of `low` and `pos`:

- If `k` is found in `arr`, then `pos` will be the index of `k`.
- If `k` is not found in `arr`, then `pos` will be -1.

- `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`. This means `low` points to the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`.
- `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`. This means `high` points to the smallest element in `arr` that is greater than `k`.

Since `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, `low` must be the index of the largest element in `arr` that is strictly less than `k`.

Now, let's consider the possible scenarios:

### Scenario 1: `k` is found in `arr`
- `pos` will be the index of `k`.
- `low` will be the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than `k`.

Since `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, `low` will be one index before `pos`.

### Scenario 2: `k` is not found in `arr`
- `pos` will be -1.
- `low` will be the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than `k`.

In this case, `low` will be the largest index such that `arr[low] < k`.

### Calculation of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`:
- If `k` is found in `arr`, `low + 1` will be `pos`.
- If `k` is not found in `arr`, `low + 1` will be the index where `k` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.

- `pos + 1` will be the index of `k` plus 1 if `k` is found, or 0 if `k` is not found.

### Final Output:
- If `k` is found in `arr`, `low + 1` will be `pos`, and `pos + 1` will be `pos + 1`.
- If `k` is not found in `arr`, `low + 1` will be the index where `k` would be inserted, and `pos + 1` will be 0.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **(low + 1, pos + 1) (where low + 1 is the index where k would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of arr, and pos + 1 is the index of k plus 1 if k is found, or 0 if k is not found)**
