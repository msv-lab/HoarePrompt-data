The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It initializes `n`, `k`, and `arr` by calling `func_1` and `func_2`, respectively. It then searches for the integer `k` in the list `arr` and updates `pos` to the index of `k` if found, otherwise `pos` remains -1. The function also performs a binary search to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`. If `k` is found in `arr` (i.e., `arr[low] == k`), it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the index where `k` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr` and the index of `k` plus 1 if `k` is found, or 0 if `k` is not found. The final state of the program includes `pos` being the index of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, and `st` containing all the midpoints checked during the binary search.
