Output State: **`pos` is the index of the element `k` in the list `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, or `n` if no such index exists. `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, or 0 if no such index exists. `st` contains all the midpoints that were checked during the loop execution.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes, `low` will be the largest index in the list `arr` where the element at that index is less than or equal to `k`, or it will be `n` if no such element exists. `high` will be the smallest index in the list `arr` where the element at that index is greater than `k`, or it will be 0 if no such element exists. The set `st` will contain all the midpoints that were checked during the binary search process. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
