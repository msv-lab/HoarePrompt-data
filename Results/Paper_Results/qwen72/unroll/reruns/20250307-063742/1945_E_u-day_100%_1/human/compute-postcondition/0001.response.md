Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, and `pos` is an integer that will be updated to the index of k in arr if k is found.**

The code `arr = func_2()` updates the value of `arr` to whatever `func_2()` returns. Since the initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and assuming `func_2()` maintains this property, `arr` still holds a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` after the execution. The values of `n`, `k`, and `pos` remain unchanged.
