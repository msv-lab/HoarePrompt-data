### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search.
   - We are allowed to perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation before running the binary search.
   - The goal is to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

2. **Binary Search in a Permutation:**
   - Binary search works correctly only on sorted arrays. However, in this problem, we can perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work.
   - The binary search algorithm provided initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n`, and the loop continues until `r - l = 1`.

3. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The function `func_3` reads the input, finds the position of `x` in the permutation, and then performs a binary search.
   - If the binary search finds `x` at the correct position (`arr[low] == k`), it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - If `x` is not found at the correct position, it prints `1` and the indices of the elements to swap to place `x` at the correct position.

4. **Swapping Elements:**
   - The function `func_3` only performs one swap if necessary. It swaps the element at position `low` with the element at the position where `x` is found.
   - This approach is correct because it ensures that `x` is moved to the position where the binary search expects it to be.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.
   - Each test case is handled by calling `func_3`, which reads the input, performs the necessary operations, and prints the output.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position and needs to be swapped.

7. **Constraints:**
   - The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints (up to 20,000 test cases and permutations of size up to 200,000).

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function 1:**
  - `func_1` reads a line of input and splits it into integers. This is used to read the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.
  - The function returns an iterator of integers, which is appropriate for the problem.

- **Function 2:**
  - `func_2` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers. This is used to read the permutation `arr`.
  - The function returns a list of integers, which is appropriate for the problem.

- **Function 3:**
  - `func_3` reads `n` and `x` using `func_1` and the permutation `arr` using `func_2`.
  - It then finds the position of `x` in `arr` and stores it in `pos`.
  - The binary search is performed with `low` initialized to 0 and `high` initialized to `n`.
  - The loop continues until `low + 1 < high`, which is a valid condition for binary search.
  - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
  - If `arr[mid] > x`, `high` is updated to `mid`; otherwise, `low` is updated to `mid`.
  - After the loop, if `arr[low] == x`, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
  - If `arr[low] != x`, it prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to swap the elements.

### Key Points to Validate:

- **Correctness of Binary Search:**
  - The binary search logic is correct. It correctly updates `low` and `high` based on the comparison with `x`.
  - The loop condition `low + 1 < high` ensures that the search narrows down to a single element.

- **Handling the Swap:**
  - The program correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation.
  - It performs a single swap to move `x` to the position where the binary search expects it to be.
  - This approach is sufficient because the problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always enough, and the program only needs to perform one swap if necessary.

- **Output Format:**
  - The program correctly prints the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to swap, adhering to the problem's output format.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation and performs the necessary swap to ensure that the binary search finds `x` at the correct position. It adheres to the problem constraints and handles multiple test cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
