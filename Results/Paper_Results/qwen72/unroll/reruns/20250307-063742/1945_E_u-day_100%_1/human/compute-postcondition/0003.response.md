The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the default behavior of `range(n)`.

Given that `n` is already a positive integer (which means `n` is at least 1), the loop condition is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0**
