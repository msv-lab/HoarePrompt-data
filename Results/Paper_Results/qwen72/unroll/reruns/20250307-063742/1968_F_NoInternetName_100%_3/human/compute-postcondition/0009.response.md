The function `func_5` does not have any parameters listed in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships provided, it seems there is a mismatch between the function signature and the described parameters. Assuming the function should accept the parameters `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, and `r` as described, the functionality can be outlined as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: `n` and `q` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30; `l` and `r` are integers where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The function returns a specific output based on these inputs, but the exact return value is not specified in the provided information.**
