Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases and reads the input in the specified format. The use of `func_1` to map the input to integers is appropriate and aligns with the problem's input requirements.

2. **Cumulative XOR Calculation**: The function `func_5` calculates the cumulative XOR values for the array `a` and stores them in the list `x`. This is a crucial step because it allows for efficient computation of the XOR of any subarray using the precomputed values.

3. **Index Tracking**: The program uses a `defaultdict` of lists (`inds`) to track the indices where each cumulative XOR value appears. This is useful for quickly checking if there are multiple segments with the same XOR value.

4. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program checks if the cumulative XOR from the start up to index `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR up to index `r`. If they are equal, it means the subarray from `l` to `r` can be split into segments with the same XOR value, and the program prints 'Yes'.

5. **Binary Search for Indices**: If the cumulative XOR values are not equal, the program uses `func_4` and `func_3` to perform a binary search on the indices stored in `inds` to find the largest index less than `l` and the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` where the cumulative XOR values match. If such indices exist and the upper index is greater than the lower index, it means the subarray can be split into segments with the same XOR value, and the program prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

6. **Function `func_2` and `func_4`**: These functions perform binary search to find the appropriate indices. `func_2` returns the largest index where the predicate is `True`, and `func_4` returns that index plus 1 if it exists. This is used to find the indices in `inds` for the query.

7. **Function `func_3`**: This function is essentially a wrapper around `func_2` and is used to find the largest index where the predicate is `True` in the context of the query.

8. **Correctness of the Logic**: The logic for determining if a subarray is interesting is correct. The program checks if the cumulative XOR values match and uses binary search to verify if there are valid segments. The conditions for printing 'Yes' or 'No' are correctly implemented.

However, there is a potential issue in the implementation of `func_3` and `func_4`:

- **`func_3`**: The comment states that `func_3` returns a boolean value, but the actual implementation returns an index, not a boolean. This is a discrepancy in the comments, but the implementation is correct for the intended use in `func_5`.

- **`func_4`**: The function correctly returns the index plus 1 if a valid index is found, and `None` otherwise. This is used to find the largest index less than `l` where the cumulative XOR value matches.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
