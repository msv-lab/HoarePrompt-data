Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ l < r â‰¤ n, `x` is a list containing the integer 0, `inds` is an empty defaultdict with list as the default factory.**

The code initializes `inds` as a defaultdict with lists as the default factory. The other variables (`n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
