Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be a correct solution to the problem. Here is a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the number of elements in the array and the number of queries, respectively.
   - It then reads the array `a` and initializes a prefix XOR array `x` and a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of each prefix XOR value.

2. **Prefix XOR Array:**
   - The prefix XOR array `x` is constructed such that `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - This is done using the line `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)`.

3. **Dictionary of Indices:**
   - The dictionary `inds` maps each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this value occurs.
   - This is done using the line `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)`.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - It checks if the subarray `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` is interesting by comparing `x[l-1]` and `x[r]`.
   - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it means the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` is zero, which is a special case where the subarray is interesting.
   - If the XOR is not zero, it uses binary search to find the indices in the `inds` dictionary where the prefix XOR values match the conditions for the subarray to be interesting.

5. **Binary Search Functions:**
   - `func_2` and `func_3` are binary search functions that find the largest index less than `l` and the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` in the list of indices for a given prefix XOR value.
   - `func_4` adjusts the result of `func_2` to be 1-based index if found.

6. **Final Check:**
   - The program checks if the upper index is greater than the lower index to determine if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.
   - If the condition is met, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

The logic and implementation of the program align with the problem requirements, and the use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures efficient query handling. Therefore, the program is correct.
