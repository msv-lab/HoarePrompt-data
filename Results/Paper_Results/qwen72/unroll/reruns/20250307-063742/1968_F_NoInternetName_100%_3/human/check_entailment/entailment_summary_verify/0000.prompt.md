You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

from collections import defaultdict
#Function 1:
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())

#Function 2:
def func_2(arr, predicate):
    (l, r) = (0, len(arr))
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if predicate(arr[mid]):
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if predicate(arr[l]):
        return l
    return None

#Function 4:

    result = func_2(arr, predicate)

        return result + 1

    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
    for i in range(q):
        (l, r) = func_1(int)
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
        if upper > lower:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` and a number of queries `q`. For each query, it checks if the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` from the start up to index `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR up to index `r`. If they are equal, or if there exists a subarray within the specified range where the cumulative XOR is the same, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not modify the input parameters `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, or `r`, and it does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases for the problem described. Specifically, the logic for determining if a subarray is interesting is flawed. The program checks if `x[l - 1] == x[r]` or if there exists an index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and an index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` and is greater than the index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`. However, this logic does not guarantee that the subarray can be divided into `k > 1` parts where the XOR of each part is equal.

### Counterexample:
Consider the array `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the query `(l, r) = (1, 5)`.

- The prefix XOR array `x` would be `[0, 1, 3, 0, 4, 1]`.
- The query checks if `x[0] == x[5]` (which is `0 == 1`, so it's `False`).
- It then checks if there exists an index in `inds[1]` that is less than `1` and an index in `inds[0]` that is less than or equal to `5` and is greater than the index in `inds[1]` that is less than `1`. This is also `False` because `inds[1] = [1, 5]` and `inds[0] = [0, 3]`.

However, the subarray `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is not interesting because there is no way to split it into `k > 1` parts where the XOR of each part is equal. The program should output "NO" for this query, but it does not handle this case correctly.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve checking if there exists a valid partition of the subarray such that the XOR of each part is equal. This can be done by iterating through possible partition points and checking if the XOR of the segments is the same. The provided program does not implement this logic correctly, leading to potential incorrect outputs.
