t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n and q are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30, l and r are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
