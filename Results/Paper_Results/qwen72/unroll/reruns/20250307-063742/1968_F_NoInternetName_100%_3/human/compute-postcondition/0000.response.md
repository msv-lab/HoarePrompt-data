Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `q` are updated to the integers returned by the function `func_1(int)`. The other variables (`a`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
