The function `func_1` accepts a callable `cast` and returns an iterator that applies the `cast` function to each element in the list of strings obtained by splitting the user input. The user input is expected to be a single line of space-separated values. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the returned iterator is ready to be consumed, yielding the results of applying `cast` to each string in the input.
