Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(func_1(int))` reassigns `a` to a new list of integers returned by `func_1(int)`.
- The initial state specifies that `n` and `q` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, and this remains unchanged.
- The initial state also specifies that `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, but after the code execution, `a` is now a list of integers returned by `func_1(int)`, which may or may not satisfy the previous condition.
- The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged and still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
