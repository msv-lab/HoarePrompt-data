### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It reads the array `a` and initializes a prefix XOR array `x` with an initial value of 0.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of each prefix XOR value.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The prefix XOR array `x` is correctly calculated by iterating through the array `a` and updating the prefix XOR value.
   - The dictionary `inds` is correctly populated with the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs. This is crucial for efficiently handling queries.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - It checks if the prefix XOR values at `l-1` and `r` are equal. If they are, it prints "Yes" because the subarray can be split into two parts with the same XOR value.
   - If the prefix XOR values are not equal, it uses binary search to find the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the smallest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - The logic for determining if the subarray is interesting is correct: if `upper` is greater than `lower`, it means there is a way to split the subarray into two parts with the same XOR value.

4. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search function `func_2` is correctly implemented to find the largest index that satisfies the `predicate` function.
   - The function `func_3` is a wrapper around `func_2` and returns the result of `func_2`. This is redundant but does not affect the correctness of the program.
   - The function `func_4` adds one to the result of `func_2` to find the largest index less than `l` in `inds[x[r]]`. The use of `or 0` ensures that if no valid index is found, it defaults to 0, which is correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the subarray is not interesting.
   - The constraints are respected, and the program should work efficiently within the given limits.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:

- **State Before `func_1` Call:**
  - `cast` is a callable that can convert strings to the desired type (e.g., int, float).
  - `func_1` correctly returns an iterator that applies the `cast` function to each element in the list of strings obtained by splitting the user input.

- **State Before `func_2` Call:**
  - `arr` is a list of integers.
  - `predicate` is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean.
  - `func_2` correctly performs a binary search to find the largest index that satisfies the `predicate` function.

- **State Before `func_3` Call:**
  - `arr` is a list of integers.
  - `predicate` is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean.
  - `func_3` correctly returns the result of `func_2`, which is the largest index that satisfies the `predicate` function.

- **State Before `func_4` Call:**
  - `arr` is a list of integers.
  - `predicate` is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean.
  - `func_4` correctly returns the result of `func_2` plus one if a valid index is found, and `None` otherwise.

- **State Before `func_5` Call:**
  - `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5.
  - `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30.
  - `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
  - `func_5` correctly initializes the prefix XOR array `x` and the dictionary `inds`.
  - The loop correctly processes each query and prints "Yes" or "No" based on the conditions specified.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the provided problem description. The use of prefix XOR and binary search is appropriate, and the implementation is correct.

Final: **True**
