You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and initializes a prefix XOR array `x` with an initial value of 0.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of each prefix XOR value.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR array `x` by iterating through the array `a` and updating the prefix XOR value.
   - It also updates the dictionary `inds` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - It checks if the prefix XOR values at `l-1` and `r` are equal. If they are, it prints "Yes" because the subarray can be split into two parts with the same XOR value.
   - If the prefix XOR values are not equal, it uses binary search to find the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the smallest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it prints "Yes" because it means there is a way to split the subarray into two parts with the same XOR value.
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Analysis of Functions:

- **`func_1(cast)`**: This function reads input, splits it, and maps the `cast` function to each element. It is used to read integers from input.
- **`func_2(arr, predicate)`**: This function performs a binary search on the array `arr` to find the largest index that satisfies the `predicate` function.
- **`func_3(arr, predicate)`**: This function is a wrapper around `func_2` and returns the result of `func_2`.
- **`func_4(arr, predicate)`**: This function is similar to `func_2` but returns the result plus one if a valid index is found.
- **`func_5()`**: This is the main function that handles the test cases and queries.

### Correctness Check:

- **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
  - The prefix XOR array `x` is correctly calculated by iterating through the array `a` and updating the prefix XOR value.
  - The dictionary `inds` is correctly populated with the indices of each prefix XOR value.

- **Query Handling:**
  - The program correctly checks if the prefix XOR values at `l-1` and `r` are equal.
  - The binary search functions `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are used to find the indices `lower` and `upper` in the dictionary `inds`.
  - The logic for determining if the subarray is interesting is correct: if `upper` is greater than `lower`, it means there is a way to split the subarray into two parts with the same XOR value.

### Potential Issues:

- **Binary Search Implementation:**
  - The binary search functions `func_2` and `func_3` are essentially the same, which is redundant.
  - The function `func_4` adds one to the result of `func_2`, which is used to find the largest index less than `l` in `inds[x[r]]`.
  - The use of `or 0` in `func_4` ensures that if no valid index is found, it defaults to 0, which is correct.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the subarray is not interesting.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the provided problem description. The use of prefix XOR and binary search is appropriate and the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
