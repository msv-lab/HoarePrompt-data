### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and initializes a prefix XOR array `x` with an initial value of 0.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of each prefix XOR value.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR array `x` by iterating through the array `a` and updating the prefix XOR value.
   - It also updates the dictionary `inds` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - It checks if the prefix XOR values at `l-1` and `r` are equal. If they are, it prints "Yes" because the subarray can be split into two parts with the same XOR value.
   - If the prefix XOR values are not equal, it uses binary search to find the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the smallest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it prints "Yes" because it means there is a way to split the subarray into two parts with the same XOR value.
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Analysis of Functions:

- **`func_1(cast)`**: This function reads input, splits it, and maps the `cast` function to each element. It is used to read integers from input.
- **`func_2(arr, predicate)`**: This function performs a binary search on the array `arr` to find the largest index that satisfies the `predicate` function.
- **`func_3(arr, predicate)`**: This function is a wrapper around `func_2` and returns the result of `func_2`.
- **`func_4(arr, predicate)`**: This function is similar to `func_2` but returns the result plus one if a valid index is found.
- **`func_5()`**: This is the main function that handles the test cases and queries.

### Correctness Check:

- **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
  - The prefix XOR array `x` is correctly calculated by iterating through the array `a` and updating the prefix XOR value.
  - The dictionary `inds` is correctly populated with the indices of each prefix XOR value.

- **Query Handling:**
  - The program correctly checks if the prefix XOR values at `l-1` and `r` are equal.
  - The binary search functions `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are used to find the indices `lower` and `upper` in the dictionary `inds`.
  - The logic for determining if the subarray is interesting is correct: if `upper` is greater than `lower`, it means there is a way to split the subarray into two parts with the same XOR value.

### Potential Issues:

- **Binary Search Implementation:**
  - The binary search functions `func_2` and `func_3` are essentially the same, which is redundant.
  - The function `func_4` adds one to the result of `func_2`, which is used to find the largest index less than `l` in `inds[x[r]]`.
  - The use of `or 0` in `func_4` ensures that if no valid index is found, it defaults to 0, which is correct.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the subarray is not interesting.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the provided problem description. The use of prefix XOR and binary search is appropriate and the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
