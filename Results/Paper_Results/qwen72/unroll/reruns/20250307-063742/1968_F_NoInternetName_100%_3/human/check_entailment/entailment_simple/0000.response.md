### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and initializes a list `x` to store the cumulative XOR values of the array elements.
   - A `defaultdict` named `inds` is used to store the indices where each cumulative XOR value appears.

2. **Cumulative XOR Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the cumulative XOR values and stores them in the list `x`.
   - It also updates the `inds` dictionary to keep track of the indices where each cumulative XOR value appears.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - It checks if the cumulative XOR value at index `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR value at index `r`. If they are equal, it prints "Yes" because the subarray from `l` to `r` can be split into two parts with the same XOR value.
   - If the cumulative XOR values are not equal, it uses the `func_4` and `func_3` functions to find the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the largest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it prints "Yes" because it means there is a valid split point in the subarray.
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Binary Search Functions:**
   - `func_2` and `func_3` are both binary search functions that help find the largest or smallest index satisfying a given predicate.
   - `func_4` and `func_3` are used to find the indices in the `inds` dictionary that are relevant to the query.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the subarray is not interesting by correctly using the binary search functions and the `inds` dictionary.
   - The use of `or 0` in `func_4` ensures that if no valid index is found, it defaults to 0, which is a safe value in this context.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description. The use of cumulative XOR values and binary search to find valid split points is appropriate and efficient. The program also handles the input and output correctly for multiple test cases and queries.
