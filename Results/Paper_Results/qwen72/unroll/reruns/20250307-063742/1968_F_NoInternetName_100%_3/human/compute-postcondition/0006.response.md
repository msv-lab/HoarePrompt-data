Output State: **`n` and `q` remain unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, `x` is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, and `inds` is a defaultdict with lists as values, where each key in `inds` corresponds to a value in `x` and the list contains the indices at which that value appears in `x`.**
