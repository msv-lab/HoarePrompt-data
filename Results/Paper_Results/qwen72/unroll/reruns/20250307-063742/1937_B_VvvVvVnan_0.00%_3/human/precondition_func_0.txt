The function should take three parameters: the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5) representing the width of the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples, each containing two binary strings of length n, representing the rows of the grid for each test case. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
