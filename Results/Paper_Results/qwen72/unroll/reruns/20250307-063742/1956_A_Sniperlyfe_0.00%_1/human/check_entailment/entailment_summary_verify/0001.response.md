### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(n, p)`**
   - The function correctly implements the logic for determining the number of winners for a given initial number of players `n` and the sequence of positions `p` to kick out.
   - The while loop continues as long as there are enough players to kick out at least one of the positions in `p`.
   - The generator expression `sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))` correctly counts the number of players to be kicked out in each round.
   - The function updates `n` by subtracting the number of players kicked out and returns the final number of remaining players, which are the winners.

2. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - The function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results for the current test case.
   - For each initial player count `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to determine the number of winners and appends the result to `res`.
   - **Issue 1:** The program prints the results for each test case immediately after processing it, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, the results for each test case should be printed together after processing all the initial player counts for that test case.
   - **Issue 2:** The program does not handle the separation of results for different test cases. Each test case's results should be printed on a new line.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of `func_2()` to address the issues:

```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The logic in `func_1` is correct and follows the problem description.
- The main issues in `func_2` are the immediate printing of results and the lack of separation for different test cases.
- After correcting these issues, the program should work as expected and produce the correct output for the given problem.

Final: **False** (due to the issues in `func_2` as described above)
