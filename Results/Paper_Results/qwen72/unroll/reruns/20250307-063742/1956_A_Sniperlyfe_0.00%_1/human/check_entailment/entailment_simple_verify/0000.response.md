Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies two issues in the program:

1. **Output Formatting Issue in `func_2`:** The `res` list is printed inside the loop where it is being populated, which results in incorrect output formatting. The problem description clearly states that for each test case, the results should be printed together after all `n` values have been processed. The current implementation will print partial results after each `n` is processed, which is incorrect.

2. **Efficiency and Clarity in `func_1`:** The `func_1` function does handle the case where `n` is less than the minimum value in `p` correctly, but it is not efficient. The function will enter the while loop and immediately exit without modifying `n` if `n` is less than the minimum value in `p`. While this behavior is correct, it could be optimized by adding a check at the beginning of the function to return `n` if it is less than the minimum value in `p`.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the logical error and inefficiency in the program. The suggested corrected version of the program addresses these issues by moving the print statement outside the loop in `func_2` and optimizing `func_1`.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program as originally written is incorrect.

Final: **False**
