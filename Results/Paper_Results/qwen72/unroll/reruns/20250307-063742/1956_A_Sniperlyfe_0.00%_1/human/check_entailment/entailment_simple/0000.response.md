### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
   - The function takes two parameters: `n` (the number of players initially) and `p` (a sorted list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round).
   - The while loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `p`. This ensures that the game continues until no more players can be kicked out.
   - Inside the loop, the number of players to be kicked out is calculated using a generator expression that sums up 1 for each position `x` in `p` that is less than or equal to `n`.
   - After each round, `n` is decremented by the number of players kicked out.
   - The function returns the final value of `n`, which is the number of players remaining after the game ends.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, followed by the list `p` and the list `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results for each `n` in `qs`.
   - For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to `res`.
   - It then prints the results for the current test case.
   - The loop continues for all test cases.

### Issues:
- **Printing Inside the Loop**: The program prints the results inside the loop for each `n` in `qs`. This means that the results for each test case are printed prematurely, and the final output for each test case is not complete. The correct approach would be to print the results after all `n` values in `qs` have been processed for a given test case.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, the print statement should be moved outside the inner loop, so that the results for each test case are printed only once after all `n` values in `qs` have been processed.

```python
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum(1 for x in p if x <= n)
    return n

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

# Call the function to run the program
func_2()
```

### Correctness:
- **True**: The logic of the program is correct, and it would produce the correct results if the print statement were moved outside the inner loop.
- **False**: The current program is incorrect because it prints the results prematurely, leading to incomplete output for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
