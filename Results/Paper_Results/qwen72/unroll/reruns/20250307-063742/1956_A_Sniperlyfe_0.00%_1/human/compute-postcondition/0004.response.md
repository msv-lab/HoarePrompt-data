Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `k` and `q` from the input, followed by a list `p` of `k` unique positive integers in increasing order, and a list `qs` of `q` positive integers. It then processes each integer `n` in `qs` by calling `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to a list `res`. After processing all integers in `qs`, it prints the results in `res` as a space-separated string. This process is repeated for each of the `t` test cases. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the variables `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` will hold the values from the last test case. **
