**Reasoning:**

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the process of kicking out players based on the sequence `p` and the initial number of players `n`.
   - The while loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `p`. This ensures that the function keeps reducing `n` by the number of players that should be kicked out in each round.
   - The expression `sum(1 for x in p if x <= n)` correctly counts the number of players that should be kicked out in the current round.
   - The function returns the value of `n` after all possible rounds, which is the number of players remaining (i.e., the winners).

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results for each `n` in `qs`.
   - For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to determine the number of winners and appends the result to `res`.
   - However, there is a logical error in the function: the `print` statement is inside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs`. This means that the results are printed prematurely after each `n` is processed, rather than after all `n` values have been processed for a given test case.

**Correctness:**
- The function `func_1` is correct in its logic and implementation.
- The function `func_2` has a logical error where the `print` statement is misplaced, causing incorrect output format.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **False**
