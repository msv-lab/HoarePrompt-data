The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`. 

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 250.
- `k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100.
- `p` is a list of `k` unique positive integers in increasing order where 1 <= p[i] <= 100.
- `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers where 1 <= qs[i] <= 100.

The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept these parameters and return a value based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`. `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 250, `k` and `q` are positive integers between 1 and 100, `p` is a list of `k` unique positive integers in increasing order where each integer is between 1 and 100, and `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 100. The function returns a value based on these inputs.**
