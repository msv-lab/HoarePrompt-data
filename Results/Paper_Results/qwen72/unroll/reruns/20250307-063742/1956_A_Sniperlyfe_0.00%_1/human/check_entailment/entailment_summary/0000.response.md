### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `n` (the number of players initially) and `p` (the list of positions to kick out players).
   - It repeatedly decreases `n` by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` until `n` is less than the minimum value in `p`.
   - This correctly simulates the rounds of the game where players are kicked out based on the positions in `p`.
   - The function returns the number of players remaining after all rounds, which is the number of winners.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, followed by the list `p` of `k` unique positive integers in increasing order, and the list `qs` of `q` positive integers.
   - It processes each integer `n` in `qs` by calling `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to a list `res`.
   - After processing all integers in `qs`, it prints the results in `res` as a space-separated string.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results for each test case.

3. **Combining the Functions:**
   - The combination of `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implements the game as described in the problem.
   - `func_1` simulates the game for a single value of `n` and `p`.
   - `func_2` reads the input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles cases where `n` is less than the minimum value in `p` from the start.
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles the input format and multiple test cases.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The output format in `func_2` matches the required output format for the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it meets the problem description and handles all edge cases and input formats correctly.

Correctness: **True**
