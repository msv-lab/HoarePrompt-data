The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `t` is already defined as an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, which means `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not require any specific state.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of k unique positive integers in increasing order where 1 <= p[i] <= 100, and `qs` is a list of q positive integers where 1 <= qs[i] <= 100**
