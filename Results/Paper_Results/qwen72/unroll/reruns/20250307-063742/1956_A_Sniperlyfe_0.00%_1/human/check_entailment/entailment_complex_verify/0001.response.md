Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies the main issues in the `func_2` function:
1. **Immediate Printing in `func_2()`**: The program prints the results for each test case immediately after processing each initial player count, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, the results for each test case should be printed together after processing all the initial player counts for that test case.
2. **Test Case Separation**: The program does not handle the separation of results for different test cases. Each test case's results should be printed on a new line.

These issues are indeed significant and affect the correctness of the program. The logic in `func_1` is correct and follows the problem description accurately. However, the way `func_2` handles the output and the structure of the test cases is flawed, leading to incorrect output format.

### Corrected Program:
The corrected version of `func_2` should collect all results for a test case in a list and print them together after processing all initial player counts for that test case. Additionally, each test case's results should be printed on a new line.

```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues in the program. The program as given is incorrect due to the immediate printing and lack of test case separation. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
