The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and a sorted list of integers `p` (where each element is between 1 and 100). It repeatedly decreases `n` by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` until `n` is less than the minimum value in `p`. The function then returns the updated value of `n`, which is guaranteed to be less than the minimum value in the list `p`. The list `p` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
