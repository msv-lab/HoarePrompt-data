Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the `func_2` function. Specifically, the `res` list is being printed inside the loop where it is being populated, which means it will print the result after each `n` is processed, rather than after all `n` values have been processed for a given test case. This will result in incorrect output formatting, as the problem description requires all results for a test case to be printed together.

Additionally, the `func_1` function does not handle the case where `n` is less than the minimum value in `p` correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is less than the minimum value in `p`, no players should be kicked out, and the number of winners should be `n`. However, the current implementation will subtract 0 from `n` and return `n`, which is correct, but it is not efficient and could be misleading.

Here is a more correct version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))
    return n

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

This version ensures that the results are printed correctly after all `n` values have been processed for each test case.
