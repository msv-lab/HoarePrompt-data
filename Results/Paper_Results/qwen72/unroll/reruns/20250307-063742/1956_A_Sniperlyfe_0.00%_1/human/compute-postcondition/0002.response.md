Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, k and q are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, p is a list of k unique positive integers in increasing order where 1 <= p[i] <= 100, and qs is a list of q positive integers where 1 <= qs[i] <= 100. The loop has printed the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` for each iteration of `t`. The variables `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` are redefined in each iteration of the loop, and the final values of these variables will be the ones from the last iteration.**
