### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** `n` (number of players) and `p` (list of positions to kick out).
   - **Output:** The number of players remaining after all rounds.
   - **Behavior:**
     - The function iterates while `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
     - In each iteration, it subtracts the number of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n`.
     - This correctly simulates the process of kicking out players based on the sequence `p` until no more players can be kicked out.
     - The function returns the final number of players remaining, which is the number of winners.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** None (reads from standard input).
   - **Output:** Prints the results for each test case.
   - **Behavior:**
     - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case:
       - Reads `k` (length of `p`) and `q` (number of `n` values).
       - Reads the list `p` of positions to kick out.
       - Reads the list `qs` of `n` values.
       - Initializes an empty list `res` to store the results.
       - For each `n` in `qs`, calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to `res`.
       - Prints the results in `res` as a space-separated string.
     - **Issue:**
       - The original code prints `res` inside the loop where it is being populated, which is incorrect. The results for each test case should be printed together after all `n` values have been processed.
     - **Corrected Code:**
       - The corrected code moves the print statement outside the loop where `res` is being populated, ensuring that the results for each test case are printed together.

3. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly simulates the game by repeatedly removing players based on the sequence `p` until no more players can be removed.
   - The condition `while n >= min(p)` ensures that the loop continues only while there are players that can be kicked out.
   - The subtraction `n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))` correctly removes the players at the specified positions.
   - The function returns the correct number of remaining players.

4. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - The corrected code ensures that the results for each test case are printed together, which matches the problem description.
   - The function does not return any value, but it prints the results as required.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was correct in identifying the issue with the print statement in `func_2`.
- The corrected version of `func_2` ensures that the results are printed correctly after all `n` values have been processed for each test case.
- The `func_1` function is logically correct and efficiently handles the game simulation.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the print statement issue in `func_2`, but the corrected version is correct.)
