### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints such that a specific number \( x \) is assigned to a specific position \( n \) in the line during the settling process.
   - The settling process repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the numbers assigned follow a specific pattern: \( 1, 2, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For a given position \( n \) and number \( x \), the value \( k \) must satisfy the condition that \( n \) modulo \( 2k - 2 \) should map to \( x \) in the settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern can be broken down into two parts: the first \( k \) positions and the next \( k - 2 \) positions.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates \( y = n + x \).
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 because the settling pattern cannot match the given \( n \) and \( x \) for any \( k \).
   - If \( y \) is even, it calculates \( q = \frac{y - 2}{2} \) and calls `func_1` to find all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It then checks if \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and, if so, calls `func_1` again with \( q = \frac{n - x}{2} \).
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined, duplicates are removed, and the length of the resulting list is printed as the answer.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` takes two integers \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It initializes an empty list \( M \) to store the divisors.
   - It calculates the square root of \( q \) and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). If so, it adds it to \( M \).
   - It then iterates from 1 to the square root of \( q \) and checks if \( i \) is a divisor of \( q \). If \( i \) is a divisor and \( i \geq x - 1 \), it adds \( i \) to \( M \). Similarly, it checks if \( q // i \geq x - 1 \) and adds \( q // i \) to \( M \).
   - Finally, it returns the list \( M \).

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( y \) is odd by printing 0.
   - The calculation of \( q \) and the use of `func_1` to find divisors are appropriate for the problem.
   - The program correctly combines the results from both calls to `func_1` and removes duplicates.
   - The logic for checking if \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and the subsequent call to `func_1` is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the provided constraints and examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
