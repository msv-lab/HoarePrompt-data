### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem describes a pattern where students are numbered in a line. The pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - The first \(k\) positions are numbered \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, k\).
   - The next \(k - 2\) positions are numbered \(k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2\).
   - This pattern repeats.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers \(n\) and \(x\).
   - \(n\) is Vasya's position in the line.
   - \(x\) is the number Vasya received during the settling.
   - The output is the number of different \(k\) values that fit the given constraints.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The number \(x\) Vasya received must be within the range of the pattern.
   - The pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions, so \(n \mod (2k - 2)\) should give a position within the first \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - For \(x\) to be valid, it must be within the first \(k\) or the next \(k - 2\) positions of the pattern.

4. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(x\).
   - It calculates \(y = n + x\).
   - If \(y\) is odd, it prints 0 because \(y\) must be even for the pattern to fit.
   - If \(y\) is even, it calculates \((y - 2) // 2\) and calls `func_1` to find possible \(k\) values.
   - It also checks if \(n \geq 3x - 2\) and if so, calls `func_1` again with \((n - x) // 2\).
   - It combines the results, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

5. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` takes two arguments: \(q\) and \(x\).
   - It initializes an empty list \(M\) to store possible \(k\) values.
   - It calculates the square root of \(q\) and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to \(x - 1\). If so, it adds it to \(M\).
   - It iterates from 1 to \(\sqrt{q}\) and checks if \(q\) is divisible by \(i\). If so, it adds \(i\) and \(q // i\) to \(M\) if they are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - It returns the list \(M\).

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \(y\) is odd by printing 0.
   - The calculation of \((y - 2) // 2\) and \((n - x) // 2\) is correct for finding possible \(k\) values.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies divisors of \(q\) and checks if they are valid \(k\) values.
   - The program combines the results, removes duplicates, and prints the correct number of valid \(k\) values.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initial Check for Odd \(y\):**
  - The program correctly checks if \(y\) is odd and prints 0 if it is. This is because \(y = n + x\) must be even for the pattern to fit.

- **Calculation of \(q\):**
  - The program calculates \((y - 2) // 2\) and \((n - x) // 2\) to find possible \(k\) values. This is correct because:
    - \((y - 2) // 2\) corresponds to the position in the first half of the pattern.
    - \((n - x) // 2\) corresponds to the position in the second half of the pattern.

- **Function `func_1` Behavior:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly identifies divisors of \(q\) and checks if they are valid \(k\) values.
  - It correctly handles the case where the square root of \(q\) is an integer and greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
  - It iterates through possible divisors and adds them to the list \(M\) if they are valid.

- **Combining Results:**
  - The program combines the results from the two calls to `func_1`, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list. This is correct because it ensures that all possible \(k\) values are considered and duplicates are removed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the provided constraints and examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
