Output State: **`i = w` and `M` is a list containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and their corresponding quotient pairs, excluding `w` if `w` is not an integer.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i < w`, where `w` is the square root of `q`.
- For each `i`, if `i` is a divisor of `q` (i.e., `q % i == 0`), the loop checks if `i` and `q // i` are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- If `i` is a divisor and `i >= x - 1`, `i` is added to the list `M`.
- If `i` is a divisor and `q // i >= x - 1`, `q // i` is added to the list `M`.
- The loop increments `i` by 1 after each iteration.
- When `i` reaches `w`, the loop terminates.
- The final state of `i` is `w`.
- The list `M` contains all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and their corresponding quotient pairs, but `w` itself is not added to `M` unless it is an integer and meets the condition.
