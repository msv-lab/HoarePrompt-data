Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**:
   - The program calculates `y = n + x` and then checks if `y % 2 != 0`. However, this is not the correct way to determine the possible values of `k`.
   - The correct approach should involve checking the position `n` and the number `x` to determine the possible values of `k`.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find the divisors of a given number `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. However, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed.
   - The condition `if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1` is incorrect because `w` is a floating-point number, and comparing it directly to its integer part using `==` is not reliable.
   - The loop `while i < w` should include `i <= w` to ensure all divisors are considered.
   - The function should return a list of valid `k` values, but the current implementation does not correctly handle the constraints and logic for finding valid `k`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Divisors**:
   - The program should correctly identify the divisors of `n - x` and `n + x - 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and fit the pattern described in the problem.
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the divisors and their constraints.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
- Identify the divisors of `n - x` and `n + x - 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- Ensure that the divisors fit the pattern of the settling, which repeats every `2k - 2` positions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def find_divisors(num, x):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                divisors.append(i)
            if num // i >= x - 1 and num // i != i:
                divisors.append(num // i)
    return divisors

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    divisors_n_minus_x = find_divisors(n - x, x)
    divisors_n_plus_x_minus_2 = find_divisors(n + x - 2, x)
    
    valid_ks = set(divisors_n_minus_x + divisors_n_plus_x_minus_2)
    ans = len(valid_ks)
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`find_divisors` Function**:
  - This function finds all divisors of a given number `num` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
  - It iterates from 1 to the square root of `num` and checks if `i` and `num // i` are valid divisors.
  - It returns a list of valid divisors.

- **Main Loop**:
  - For each test case, it calculates the divisors of `n - x` and `n + x - 2`.
  - It combines the divisors into a set to remove duplicates and counts the number of valid `k` values.
  - It prints the count of valid `k` values for each test case.

This corrected program should produce the correct output for the given problem.
