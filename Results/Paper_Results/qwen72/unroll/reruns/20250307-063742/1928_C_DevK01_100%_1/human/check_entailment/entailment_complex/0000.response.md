### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding all possible values of `k` for which Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` are consistent with the described settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and the numbers assigned follow a specific sequence: `1, 2, ..., k, k-1, k-2, ..., 2`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is odd. If `y` is odd, it prints 0 and moves to the next test case because an odd `y` cannot be consistent with the settling pattern.
   - If `y` is even, it calculates `q = (y - 2) // 2` and calls `func_1(q, x)` to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2` and, if true, calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to find additional divisors.
   - The results from both calls are combined, duplicates are removed, and the length of the resulting list is printed as the answer.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two integers `q` and `x` and returns a list of divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It initializes an empty list `M` and calculates the square root `w` of `q`.
   - If `w` is an integer and `w >= x - 1`, it adds `w` to `M`.
   - It then iterates from 1 to `w - 1` and checks if `i` is a divisor of `q`. If `i` is a divisor and `i >= x - 1`, it adds `i` to `M`. Similarly, if `q // i >= x - 1`, it adds `q // i` to `M`.
   - Finally, it returns the list `M`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `y` is odd by printing 0.
   - The calculation of `q` and the calls to `func_1` are logically sound and follow the problem's constraints.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and their corresponding quotient pairs.
   - The program ensures that the results are unique by converting the list to a set and then back to a list.
   - The program correctly prints the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem's constraints and requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
