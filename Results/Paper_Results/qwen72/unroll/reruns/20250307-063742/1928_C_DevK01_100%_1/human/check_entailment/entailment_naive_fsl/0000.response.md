Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is equal to `x` correctly. According to the problem description, if `n == x`, then the only possible value for `k` is `n` itself, as long as `n > 1`. However, the program does not account for this specific edge case.

For example, if the input is:
```
1
4 4
```
The expected output should be `1` because `k = 4` is the only value that fits the constraints. However, the program will output `0` because it checks if `y % 2 != 0` and `y = n + x = 4 + 4 = 8`, which is even. The program then proceeds to call `func_1` with `(y - 2) // 2 = 3` and `x = 4`, which does not find any valid `k` values. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
