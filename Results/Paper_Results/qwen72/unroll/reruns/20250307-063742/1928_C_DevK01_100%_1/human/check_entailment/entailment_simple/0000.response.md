### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints based on Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the numbers assigned to positions follow a specific pattern.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is odd. If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case because \( y \) being odd implies that no valid \( k \) can satisfy the conditions.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calculates \( q = (y - 2) // 2 \) and calls the function `func_1` with \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It then checks if \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and, if true, calls `func_1` again with \( (n - x) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined, duplicates are removed, and the length of the resulting list is printed.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It initializes an empty list \( M \) to store valid \( k \) values.
   - It calculates the square root \( w \) of \( q \).
   - If \( w \) is an integer and \( w \geq x - 1 \), it adds \( w \) to \( M \).
   - It then iterates through all integers \( i \) from 1 to \( w - 1 \) and checks if \( i \) is a divisor of \( q \). If \( i \) is a divisor and \( i \geq x - 1 \), it adds \( i \) to \( M \). Similarly, it adds \( q // i \) to \( M \) if \( q // i \geq x - 1 \).
   - Finally, it returns the list \( M \) containing all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \) and their corresponding quotient pairs.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( y \) is odd by printing 0 and moving to the next test case.
   - The calculation of \( q \) and the subsequent calls to `func_1` are logically sound and follow the problem's constraints.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns all valid \( k \) values that fit the given constraints.
   - The program ensures that duplicates are removed before printing the final count.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem's constraints and requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
