The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`, where both are integers and satisfy the condition 1 <= x < q <= 10^9. The function returns a list `M` that contains all divisors of `q` which are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding quotient pairs, but only includes the quotient pairs where the quotient is an integer.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `q` and `x` (1 <= x < q <= 10^9) and returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding integer quotient pairs.**
