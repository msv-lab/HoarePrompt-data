Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the variable `t` is 0. The values of `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `dist`, `ans`, and `pos` are undefined or reset for each iteration, meaning they will not retain values from one iteration to the next.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The other variables (`n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `dist`, `ans`, and `pos`) are reset or redefined in each iteration of the loop, so they do not have a consistent state across iterations. Their values are determined by the input for each test case and the processing within the loop.
