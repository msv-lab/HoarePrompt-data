The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. For each test case, it determines and prints the position `i` where the road should be laid to ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side, and the road is as close to the middle of the village as possible. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` is 0, and the other variables (`n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `dist`, `ans`, and `pos`) are undefined or reset for each iteration.
