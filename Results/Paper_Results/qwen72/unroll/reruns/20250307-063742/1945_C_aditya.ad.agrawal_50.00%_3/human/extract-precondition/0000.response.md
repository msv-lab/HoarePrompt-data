Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident who wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident who wants to live on the right side. The function should determine the position `i` after which the road should be laid to satisfy the condition that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side, and the road is as close to the middle of the village as possible. The function should output the position `i` for each test case.**
