The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This value represents the number of test cases that the function `func` will process. The other initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains a single integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident who wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident who wants to live on the right side.**
