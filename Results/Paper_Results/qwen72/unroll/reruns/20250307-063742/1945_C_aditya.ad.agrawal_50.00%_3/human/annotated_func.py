#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident who wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident who wants to live on the right side. The function should determine the position `i` after which the road should be laid to satisfy the condition that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side, and the road is as close to the middle of the village as possible. The function should output the position `i` for each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        input_string = input()
        
        arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
        
        z = arr.count(0)
        
        o = arr.count(1)
        
        z_r = z
        
        o_r = o
        
        z_l = 0
        
        o_l = 0
        
        dist, ans, pos = abs(n / 2), 0, 0
        
        if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:
            b_d = dist
        else:
            b_d = 30001
        
        for i in arr:
            pos += 1
            if i == 0:
                z_l += 1
                z_r -= 1
            else:
                o_l += 1
                o_r -= 1
            if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
                2 - pos):
                ans = pos
                b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)
        
        print(ans)
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the variable `t` is 0. The values of `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `dist`, `ans`, and `pos` are undefined or reset for each iteration, meaning they will not retain values from one iteration to the next.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. For each test case, it determines and prints the position `i` where the road should be laid to ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side, and the road is as close to the middle of the village as possible. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` is 0, and the other variables (`n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `dist`, `ans`, and `pos`) are undefined or reset for each iteration.
