Reasoning:

The program's goal is to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances, \(\mathcal{H}\), for a given \(n \times n\) grid. The program prints specific points for each test case, but we need to verify if these points indeed maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

1. **For \(n = 2\)**:
   - The program prints: `1 1` and `1 2`.
   - The Manhattan distances are: \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\).
   - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\).
   - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 2, which is the maximum possible for \(n = 2\).

2. **For \(n = 3\)**:
   - The program prints: `1 1`, `1 2`, and `2 3`.
   - The Manhattan distances are:
     - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
     - \(|1-2| + |1-3| = 3\)
     - \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\)
     - \(|1-1| + |2-3| = 2\)
     - \(|2-2| + |3-3| = 0\)
   - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).
   - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 4, which is the maximum possible for \(n = 3\).

3. **For \(n > 3\)**:
   - The program prints: `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 4`, and then pairs of the form `j j` for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\).
   - The points are: \((1,1)\), \((1,2)\), \((2,4)\), \((4,4)\), \((5,5)\), \(\dots\), \((n,n)\).
   - Let's analyze the distances:
     - Between \((1,1)\) and \((1,2)\): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
     - Between \((1,1)\) and \((2,4)\): \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
     - Between \((1,1)\) and \((j,j)\) for \(j \geq 4\): \(|1-j| + |1-j| = 2(j-1)\)
     - Between \((1,2)\) and \((2,4)\): \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\)
     - Between \((1,2)\) and \((j,j)\) for \(j \geq 4\): \(|1-j| + |2-j| = 2j - 3\)
     - Between \((2,4)\) and \((j,j)\) for \(j \geq 4\): \(|2-j| + |4-j| = 2j - 6\)
     - Between \((j,j)\) and \((k,k)\) for \(4 \leq j < k \leq n\): \(|j-k| + |j-k| = 2(k-j)\)

   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) will include:
     - \(0\) (distance between any point and itself)
     - \(1\) (distance between \((1,1)\) and \((1,2)\))
     - \(3\) (distance between \((1,2)\) and \((2,4)\))
     - \(4\) (distance between \((1,1)\) and \((2,4)\))
     - \(2(j-1)\) for \(j \geq 4\)
     - \(2j - 3\) for \(j \geq 4\)
     - \(2j - 6\) for \(j \geq 4\)
     - \(2(k-j)\) for \(4 \leq j < k \leq n\)

   - The program ensures that the points are spread out in such a way that the distances are maximized. The distances \(2(j-1)\), \(2j - 3\), and \(2j - 6\) will cover a wide range of values, and the distances \(2(k-j)\) will ensure that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) is as large as possible.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correctly designed to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for the given \(n\).

Correctness: **True**
