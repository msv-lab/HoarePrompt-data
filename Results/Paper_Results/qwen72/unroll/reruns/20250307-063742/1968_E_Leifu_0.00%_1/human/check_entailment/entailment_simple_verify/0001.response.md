### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior using the annotated version and the original assessment.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \(n\).
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Output for \(n = 2\)**:
   - The program outputs the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has a size of 2.
   - This is correct because for \(n = 2\), the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is indeed 2.

3. **Output for \(n = 3\)**:
   - The program outputs the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\).
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4.
   - This is correct because for \(n = 3\), the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is indeed 4.

4. **Output for \(n \geq 4\)**:
   - The program outputs the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and then for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\), it outputs \((j, j)\).
   - Let's verify if this maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\):
     - The points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) contribute distances \(\{0, 1\}\).
     - The point \((2, 4)\) contributes additional distances:
       - \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\)
       - \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3\)
       - \(|2-2| + |1-4| = 0 + 3 = 3\) (already in \(\mathcal{H}\))
       - \(|2-2| + |2-4| = 0 + 2 = 2\) (already in \(\mathcal{H}\))
     - The points \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\) contribute additional distances:
       - For any pair \((j, j)\) and \((k, k)\) where \(4 \leq j < k \leq n\):
         - \(|j - k| + |j - k| = 2|j - k|\)
         - These distances are distinct for different \(j\) and \(k\) because \(|j - k|\) is unique for each pair.
       - For any pair \((1, 1)\) or \((1, 2)\) and \((j, j)\):
         - \(|1 - j| + |1 - j| = 2|j - 1|\)
         - \(|1 - j| + |2 - j| = |1 - j| + |j - 2| = |j - 1| + |2 - j|\)
         - These distances are also distinct for different \(j\).

### Verification for Specific \(n\):

- **For \(n = 4\)**:
  - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\)
  - Distances:
    - \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\): \(\{0, 1\}\)
    - \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 4)\): \(\{1 + 3 = 4\}\)
    - \((1, 1)\) and \((4, 4)\): \(\{3 + 3 = 6\}\)
    - \((1, 2)\) and \((2, 4)\): \(\{1 + 2 = 3\}\)
    - \((1, 2)\) and \((4, 4)\): \(\{3 + 2 = 5\}\)
    - \((2, 4)\) and \((4, 4)\): \(\{2 + 0 = 2\}\)
  - Set \(\mathcal{H}\): \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\)
  - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 7
  - **Note**: The original assessment stated the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 6, but the correct size is 7. This indicates an error in the original assessment.

- **For \(n = 5\)**:
  - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\)
  - Distances:
    - \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\): \(\{0, 1\}\)
    - \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 4)\): \(\{1 + 3 = 4\}\)
    - \((1, 1)\) and \((4, 4)\): \(\{3 + 3 = 6\}\)
    - \((1, 1)\) and \((5, 5)\): \(\{4 + 4 = 8\}\)
    - \((1, 2)\) and \((2, 4)\): \(\{1 + 2 = 3\}\)
    - \((1, 2)\) and \((4, 4)\): \(\{3 + 2 = 5\}\)
    - \((1, 2)\) and \((5, 5)\): \(\{4 + 3 = 7\}\)
    - \((2, 4)\) and \((4, 4)\): \(\{2 + 0 = 2\}\)
    - \((2, 4)\) and \((5, 5)\): \(\{3 + 1 = 4\}\) (already in \(\mathcal{H}\))
    - \((4, 4)\) and \((5, 5)\): \(\{1 + 1 = 2\}\) (already in \(\mathcal{H}\))
  - Set \(\mathcal{H}\): \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\)
  - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 9
  - **Note**: The original assessment stated the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 8, but the correct size is 9. This indicates another error in the original assessment.

- **For \(n = 6\)**:
  - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), \((6, 6)\)
  - Distances:
    - \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\): \(\{0, 1\}\)
    - \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 4)\): \(\{1 + 3 = 4\}\)
    - \((1, 1)\) and \((4, 4)\): \(\{3 + 3 = 6\}\)
    - \((1, 1)\) and \((5, 5)\): \(\{4 + 4 = 8\}\)
    - \((1, 1)\) and \((6, 6)\): \(\{5 + 5 = 10\}\)
    - \((1, 2)\) and \((2, 4)\): \(\{1 + 2 = 3\}\)
    - \((1, 2)\) and \((4, 4)\): \(\{3 + 2 = 5\}\)
    - \((1, 2)\) and \((5, 5)\): \(\{4 + 3 = 7\}\)
    - \((1, 2)\) and \((6, 6)\): \(\{5 + 4 = 9\}\)
    - \((2, 4)\) and \((4, 4)\): \(\{2 + 0 = 2\}\)
    - \((2, 4)\) and \((5, 5)\): \(\{3 + 1 = 4\}\) (already in \(\mathcal{H}\))
    - \((2, 4)\
