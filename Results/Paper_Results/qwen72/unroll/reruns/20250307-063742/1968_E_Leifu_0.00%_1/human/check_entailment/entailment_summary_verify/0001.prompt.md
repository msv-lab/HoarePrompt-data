You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print('1 1')
        print('1 2')
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` between 2 and 10^3, inclusive, and prints specific pairs of integers. It always prints '1 1' and '1 2'. If `n` is 3, it prints '2 3'. If `n` is greater than 3, it prints '2 4' followed by pairs of integers from '4 4' to 'n n'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and each `n` for the test cases has been processed and printed according to the specified logic.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly maximizes the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
- **Manhattan Distance**: \(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \(n\).

2. **Output for \(n = 2\)**:
   - The program outputs the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has a size of 2.
   - This is correct because for \(n = 2\), the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is indeed 2.

3. **Output for \(n = 3\)**:
   - The program outputs the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\).
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4.
   - This is correct because for \(n = 3\), the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is indeed 4.

4. **Output for \(n \geq 4\)**:
   - The program outputs the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and then for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\), it outputs \((j, j)\).
   - Let's verify if this maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\):
     - The points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) contribute distances \(\{0, 1\}\).
     - The point \((2, 4)\) contributes additional distances:
       - \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\)
       - \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3\)
       - \(|2-2| + |1-4| = 0 + 3 = 3\) (already in \(\mathcal{H}\))
       - \(|2-2| + |2-4| = 0 + 2 = 2\) (already in \(\mathcal{H}\))
     - The points \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\) contribute additional distances:
       - For any pair \((j, j)\) and \((k, k)\) where \(4 \leq j < k \leq n\):
         - \(|j - k| + |j - k| = 2|j - k|\)
         - These distances are distinct for different \(j\) and \(k\) because \(|j - k|\) is unique for each pair.
       - For any pair \((1, 1)\) or \((1, 2)\) and \((j, j)\):
         - \(|1 - j| + |1 - j| = 2|j - 1|\)
         - \(|1 - j| + |2 - j| = |1 - j| + |j - 2| = |j - 1| + |2 - j|\)
         - These distances are also distinct for different \(j\).

### Verification:
- For \(n = 4\):
  - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\)
  - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7\}\)
  - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 6
  - This is correct because for \(n = 4\), the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 6.

- For \(n = 5\):
  - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\)
  - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\)
  - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 8
  - This is correct because for \(n = 5\), the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 8.

- For \(n = 6\):
  - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), \((6, 6)\)
  - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\}\)
  - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 10
  - This is correct because for \(n = 6\), the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 10.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly outputs points that maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for the given \(n\). The logic ensures that the distances are maximized and distinct for the given points.
