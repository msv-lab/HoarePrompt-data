Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between pairs of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program prints a set of \(n\) points for each test case, and the correctness of the program can be evaluated by checking if the printed points indeed maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

1. **Initial Points**: The program always prints the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\). These points are chosen to ensure a minimum distance of 1, which is necessary to start building the set of distinct distances.

2. **Special Case for \(n = 3\)**: For \(n = 3\), the program prints the point \((2, 3)\). This results in the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\). The set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is the maximum possible for \(n = 3\).

3. **General Case for \(n > 3\)**: For \(n > 3\), the program prints the point \((2, 4)\) and then prints points \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\). This results in the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\).

   - The point \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) ensure a distance of 1.
   - The point \((2, 4)\) introduces a new distance of 3 (from \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\)).
   - The points \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\) introduce distances of \(2(j-1)\) from \((1, 1)\) and \(2(j-2)\) from \((1, 2)\), and \(|j-2| + |4-j| = 2\) from \((2, 4)\).

   These points ensure that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains a variety of distances, including the maximum possible distances for the given \(n\).

4. **Verification**:
   - For \(n = 4\), the points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((4, 4)\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which is the maximum possible.
   - For \(n = 5\), the points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), and \((5, 5)\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\), which is the maximum possible.
   - For \(n = 6\), the points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), and \((6, 6)\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\), which is the maximum possible.

The program correctly handles the special case for \(n = 3\) and the general case for \(n > 3\). The points chosen ensure that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) is maximized for each \(n\).

Correctness: **True**
