You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print('1 1')
        print('1 2')
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        print('1 1')
        
        print('1 2')
        
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, and for each of the `t` test cases, the variable `n` is processed and printed according to the loop logic. The loop prints '1 1', '1 2', '2 3' if `n` is 3, or '2 4' followed by pairs of integers from '4 4' to 'n n' if `n` is greater than 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` between 2 and 10^3, inclusive, and prints specific pairs of integers. It always prints '1 1' and '1 2'. If `n` is 3, it prints '2 3'. If `n` is greater than 3, it prints '2 4' followed by pairs of integers from '4 4' to 'n n'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and each `n` for the test cases has been processed and printed according to the specified logic.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases. Specifically, the program only prints a fixed pattern of points, which does not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\).

For example, when \(n = 3\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 3
```

The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |1-2|, |1-2| + |1-3|, |1-2| + |2-1|, |1-2| + |2-3|, |2-2| + |1-3|\} = \{0, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2\} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}
\]

This set has 4 distinct distances, which is correct for \(n = 3\). However, for \(n = 4\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
3 3
4 4
```

The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |1-2|, |1-2| + |1-4|, |1-3| + |1-3|, |1-4| + |1-4|, |1-1| + |2-1|, |1-2| + |2-4|, |1-3| + |2-3|, |1-4| + |2-4|, |1-1| + |3-3|, |1-2| + |3-3|, |1-3| + |3-3|, |1-4| + |3-3|, |1-1| + |4-4|, |1-2| + |4-4|, |1-3| + |4-4|, |1-4| + |4-4|, |2-1| + |4-1|, |2-2| + |4-2|, |2-3| + |4-3|, |2-4| + |4-4|, |3-1| + |3-1|, |3-2| + |3-2|, |3-3| + |3-3|, |3-4| + |3-4|, |4-1| + |4-1|, |4-2| + |4-2|, |4-3| + |4-3|, |4-4| + |4-4|\}
\]

This set has fewer distinct distances than the optimal solution, which should have 10 distinct distances for \(n = 4\). Therefore, the program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 4\).
