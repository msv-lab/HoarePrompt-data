Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). The program outputs a fixed pattern of points for different values of \(n\), which does not guarantee the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).

For example, for \(n = 4\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ |1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |1-2|, |1-2| + |1-4|, |1-4| + |1-4|, |1-2| + |2-4|, |2-4| + |4-4| \} = \{ 0, 1, 4, 6, 3, 2 \}
\]
This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6\}\), which has a size of 6. However, the maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 4\) is 10, as shown in the problem description.

Similarly, for \(n = 5\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
3 3
4 4
5 5
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ |1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |1-2|, |1-2| + |1-4|, |1-3| + |1-3|, |1-4| + |1-4|, |1-5| + |1-5|, |1-2| + |2-4|, |1-3| + |2-3|, |1-4| + |2-4|, |1-5| + |2-5|, |2-3| + |4-3|, |2-4| + |4-4|, |2-5| + |4-5|, |3-4| + |3-4|, |3-5| + |3-5|, |4-5| + |4-5| \}
\]
This results in a set \(\mathcal{H}\) that does not have the maximum possible size.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not always produce the optimal solution for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
