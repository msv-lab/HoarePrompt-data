Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step by step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer \(t\) (1 \le t \le 50) representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \(n\) (2 \le n \le 10^3) representing the size of the grid.

2. **Output for \(n = 2\):**
   - The program prints the cells \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these cells is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has a size of 2. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 2\).

3. **Output for \(n = 3\):**
   - The program prints the cells \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\).
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these cells is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\).

4. **Output for \(n > 3\):**
   - The program prints the cells \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 4)\).
   - For \(n > 3\), it prints additional cells \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\).

Let's analyze the output for \(n > 3\):

- The cells \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) are always included, contributing the distances \(\{0, 1\}\).
- The cell \((2, 4)\) is included, which adds more distances:
  - Distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 4)\) is \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\).
  - Distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((2, 4)\) is \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3\).
- The cells \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\) are included:
  - For each pair \((j, j)\) and \((k, k)\) where \(4 \le j < k \le n\), the distance is \(|j-k| + |j-k| = 2|j-k|\).
  - The distances between \((j, j)\) and \((1, 1)\) are \(|j-1| + |j-1| = 2(j-1)\).
  - The distances between \((j, j)\) and \((1, 2)\) are \(|j-1| + |j-2| = 2j - 3\).
  - The distances between \((j, j)\) and \((2, 4)\) are \(|j-2| + |j-4| = 2|j-3|\).

The program ensures that the distances between these cells are distinct and maximized. However, the program does not consider all possible cells and distances, which might lead to missing some potential distinct distances.

For example, for \(n = 4\), the program outputs:
- \((1, 1)\)
- \((1, 2)\)
- \((2, 4)\)
- \((4, 4)\)

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these cells is:
- \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|1-1| + |2-1| = 1\)
- \(|1-2| + |4-1| = 4\)
- \(|1-2| + |4-2| = 3\)
- \(|4-1| + |4-1| = 6\)
- \(|4-1| + |4-2| = 5\)
- \(|4-2| + |4-4| = 2\)

Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has a size of 7. This is not the maximum possible size for \(n = 4\), which is 9.

Therefore, the program does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
