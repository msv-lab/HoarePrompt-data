The function `func_1` reads a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) from the user input. It then constructs an array `ansv` of integers such that the array contains exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The length of `ansv` is at most 200, and its elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. If such an array cannot be constructed, the function does not return -1 but instead prints the length of the constructed array followed by its elements separated by spaces, and then a blank line.
