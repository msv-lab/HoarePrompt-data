Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by calling `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Reading `X`**: The function reads `X` from the input and subtracts 1 from it. This is done to handle the fact that an empty subsequence is also considered an increasing subsequence.
   - **Subsequence Length Calculation**: The function then attempts to decompose `X` into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1. This is done by repeatedly finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x + 1` and subtracting the corresponding value from `x`.
   - **Constructing the Array**: The function constructs the array `ansv` by first adding integers from 0 to `mx - 1` (where `mx` is the maximum value in `subseq_lens`). It then appends the remaining values from `subseq_lens` (excluding the first one) to `ansv`.
   - **Output**: The function prints the length of `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly decomposes `X` into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1, which is a valid approach to constructing an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The length of the array `ansv` is at most `200` because the maximum value of `X` is `10^18`, and the number of distinct powers of 2 that can sum up to `10^18` is relatively small.
   - The elements of `ansv` are within the range `[-10^9, 10^9]` because the values are derived from the indices and the subsequence lengths, which are small integers.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `X` is 2, which is the smallest possible value. For `X = 2`, the function will output a single element array `[0]`, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element).
   - The function does not handle the case where `X` is 1, which is not within the problem's constraints (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), so this is not a concern.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints the length of the array followed by the elements of the array, which matches the required output format.

However, there is one critical issue:
- The function does not handle the case where no such array can be constructed. According to the problem statement, if it is impossible to find the required array, the function should print `-1`. The current implementation does not check for this condition and always prints an array, which is incorrect.

Given this, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirement to print `-1` when no valid array can be constructed.

Correctness: **False**
