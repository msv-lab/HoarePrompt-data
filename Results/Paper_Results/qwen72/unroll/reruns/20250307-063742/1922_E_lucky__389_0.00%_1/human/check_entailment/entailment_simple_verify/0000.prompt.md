You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array, if it exists, should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].

    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of sub-sequences, `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`, `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx` - 1 followed by all the elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: - The `print(len(ansv))` statement will print the length of the list `ansv`.
    #
    #Given the initial state and the construction of `ansv`, the length of `ansv` is `mx + (n - 1)`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to correctly generate an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for certain values of \( X \). 

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input \( X = 3 \). According to the problem statement, the array should have exactly 3 increasing subsequences. However, the program does not generate such an array correctly.

**Input:**
```
1
3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
0 1
```
This output is correct because the array `[0, 1]` has exactly 3 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, and `[1]`.

**Actual Output:**
```
1
0
```
This output is incorrect because the array `[0]` has only 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.

### Analysis:
The program attempts to construct an array by repeatedly subtracting the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( x + 1 \) from \( x \). However, this approach does not always result in an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The logic for constructing the array and counting the subsequences is flawed, leading to incorrect results for some values of \( X \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus is incorrect.
