Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Counting**: The program attempts to construct an array that has exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences by decrementing \(X\) by 1 and then subtracting powers of 2. However, the logic for constructing the array and counting the subsequences is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed from the constructed array.

2. **Array Construction Logic**: The program constructs the array by appending the lengths of the subsequences it finds, but this does not ensure that the resulting array will have exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. The array construction logic is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

3. **Handling of \(X = 1\)**: The program subtracts 1 from \(X\) at the beginning, which means it will not handle the case where \(X = 1\) correctly. According to the problem, \(X\) can be as low as 2, but the program's logic might break for small values of \(X\).

4. **Output Format**: The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to find the required array. It should print \(-1\) in such cases, but the program does not have this logic.

5. **Range of Elements**: The problem specifies that all elements of the array should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\). The program constructs the array using indices, which may not always fall within this range.

To correct the program, a more robust approach is needed to ensure that the array constructed has exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. One possible approach is to use a combination of binary representation and careful array construction to achieve the desired number of subsequences.
