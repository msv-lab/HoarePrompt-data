#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array, if it exists, should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of sub-sequences, and `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of sub-sequences, `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`, `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx` - 1 followed by all the elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: - The `print(len(ansv))` statement will print the length of the list `ansv`.
    #
    #Given the initial state and the construction of `ansv`, the length of `ansv` is `mx + (n - 1)`.
    #
    #Output:
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: The loop prints each element of the `ansv` list separated by a space. The values of `x`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and `ansv` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a blank line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) from the user input. It then constructs an array `ansv` of integers such that the array contains exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The length of `ansv` is at most 200, and its elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. If such an array cannot be constructed, the function does not return -1 but instead prints the length of the constructed array followed by its elements separated by spaces, and then a blank line.
