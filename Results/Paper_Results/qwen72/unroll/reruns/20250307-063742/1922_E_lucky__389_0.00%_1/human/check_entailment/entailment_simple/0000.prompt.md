Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array, if it exists, should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].

            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of sub-sequences, and `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of sub-sequences, `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`, `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx` - 1 followed by all the elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: - The `print(len(ansv))` statement will print the length of the list `ansv`.
    #
    #Given the initial state and the construction of `ansv`, the length of `ansv` is `mx + (n - 1)`.
    #
    #Output:
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: The loop prints each element of the `ansv` list separated by a space. The values of `x`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and `ansv` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a blank line)
