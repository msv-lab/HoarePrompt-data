Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of sub-sequences, and `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `x` starts as a positive integer and is decremented by values of the form `2**i - 1` within the loop until it becomes 0.
- The list `subseq_lens` accumulates the values of `i` each time the inner loop completes, where `i` is the largest integer such that `2**(i+1) <= x + 1`.
- The variable `mx` keeps track of the maximum value of `i` that was appended to `subseq_lens` during the loop's execution. By the end of the loop, `mx` will be the largest integer in `subseq_lens`.
