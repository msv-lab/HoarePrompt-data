### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to construct an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - The array should have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, and if it's impossible, we should print \(-1\).

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \) and calls the function `func_1`.
   - Inside `func_1`, the program subtracts 1 from \( X \) and initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of the increasing subsequences.
   - It then enters a loop to decompose \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1. This is done to find the lengths of the subsequences that can be used to construct the array.
   - The loop continues until \( x \) becomes 0. In each iteration, it finds the largest \( i \) such that \( 2^{i+1} \leq x + 1 \).
   - It appends \( i \) to `subseq_lens` and subtracts \( 2^i - 1 \) from \( x \).
   - The maximum value of \( i \) found during this process is stored in `mx`.
   - After the loop, it constructs the array `ansv` by first adding the integers from 0 to \( mx-1 \).
   - Then, it appends the values from `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly decomposes \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1. This is a valid approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array of length \( n \) can be represented as a sum of binomial coefficients, which are powers of 2 minus 1.
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by first adding a sequence of integers from 0 to \( mx-1 \), which ensures that there are \( 2^i \) increasing subsequences for each \( i \) in `subseq_lens`.
   - The additional elements from `subseq_lens` are appended to `ansv` to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.
   - The program ensures that the length of the array is at most 200 by the nature of the decomposition process, as the sum of powers of 2 minus 1 will not exceed 200 for \( X \leq 10^{18} \).
   - The elements of the array are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), which is a valid constraint.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( X = 2 \) by outputting a single element array `[0]`, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element).
   - For larger values of \( X \), the program correctly decomposes \( X \) and constructs the array.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X = 1 \) (which is not in the input range, but it's worth noting).
   - The program does not explicitly check if the constructed array has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, but the decomposition process ensures this.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above. It correctly decomposes \( X \) and constructs the array to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
