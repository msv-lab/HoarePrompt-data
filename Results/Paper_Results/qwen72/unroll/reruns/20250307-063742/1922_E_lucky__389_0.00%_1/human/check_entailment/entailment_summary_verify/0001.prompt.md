You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    mx = 0

        i = 0
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) from the user input. It then constructs an array `ansv` of integers such that the array contains exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The length of `ansv` is at most 200, and its elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. If such an array cannot be constructed, the function does not return -1 but instead prints the length of the constructed array followed by its elements separated by spaces, and then a blank line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to construct an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - The array should have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, and if it's impossible, we should print \(-1\).

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \) and calls the function `func_1`.
   - Inside `func_1`, the program subtracts 1 from \( X \) and initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of the increasing subsequences.
   - It then enters a loop to decompose \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1. This is done to find the lengths of the subsequences that can be used to construct the array.
   - The loop continues until \( x \) becomes 0. In each iteration, it finds the largest \( i \) such that \( 2^{i+1} \leq x + 1 \).
   - It appends \( i \) to `subseq_lens` and subtracts \( 2^i - 1 \) from \( x \).
   - The maximum value of \( i \) found during this process is stored in `mx`.
   - After the loop, it constructs the array `ansv` by first adding the integers from 0 to \( mx-1 \).
   - Then, it appends the values from `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly decomposes \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1. This is a valid approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array of length \( n \) can be represented as a sum of binomial coefficients, which are powers of 2 minus 1.
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by first adding a sequence of integers from 0 to \( mx-1 \), which ensures that there are \( 2^i \) increasing subsequences for each \( i \) in `subseq_lens`.
   - The additional elements from `subseq_lens` are appended to `ansv` to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.
   - The program ensures that the length of the array is at most 200 by the nature of the decomposition process, as the sum of powers of 2 minus 1 will not exceed 200 for \( X \leq 10^{18} \).
   - The elements of the array are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), which is a valid constraint.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( X = 2 \) by outputting a single element array `[0]`, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element).
   - For larger values of \( X \), the program correctly decomposes \( X \) and constructs the array.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X = 1 \) (which is not in the input range, but it's worth noting).
   - The program does not explicitly check if the constructed array has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, but the decomposition process ensures this.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above. It correctly decomposes \( X \) and constructs the array to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
