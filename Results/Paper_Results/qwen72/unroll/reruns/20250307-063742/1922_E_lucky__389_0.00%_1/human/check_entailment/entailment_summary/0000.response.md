Reasoning:

The program aims to construct an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The approach taken by the program is to decompose `X-1` into a sum of numbers of the form `2^i - 1`, which corresponds to the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed by an array of length `i` (excluding the empty subsequence). This is because an array of length `i` can form `2^i` subsequences in total, and subtracting 1 accounts for the empty subsequence.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Function Call in Main Loop**: The function `func_1()` is called in the main loop, but it should be called with the input `x` as an argument. The current implementation reads `x` inside `func_1()`, which is not ideal and can lead to issues if the function is called multiple times.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. According to the problem description, if it is impossible, the program should print `-1`. However, the current implementation does not check for this and always prints an array.

3. **Array Construction**: The array `ansv` is constructed by appending the indices of the subsequence lengths. This approach is not guaranteed to produce an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences, especially for larger values of `X`. The program should ensure that the constructed array meets the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the length of the array and then the array elements, which is correct. However, it does not handle the case where the array cannot be constructed, as mentioned earlier.

5. **Range of Elements**: The elements of the array should be within the range `[-10^9, 10^9]`. The current implementation uses indices, which are non-negative integers, and does not ensure that the elements are within the specified range.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement, particularly the edge case where it is impossible to construct the array.

Correctness: **False**
