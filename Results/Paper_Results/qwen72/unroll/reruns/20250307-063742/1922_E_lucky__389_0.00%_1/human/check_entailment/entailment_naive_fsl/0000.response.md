Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to correctly generate an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for certain values of \( X \). 

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input \( X = 3 \). According to the problem statement, the array should have exactly 3 increasing subsequences. However, the program does not generate such an array correctly.

**Input:**
```
1
3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
0 1
```
This output is correct because the array `[0, 1]` has exactly 3 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, and `[1]`.

**Actual Output:**
```
1
0
```
This output is incorrect because the array `[0]` has only 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.

### Analysis:
The program attempts to construct an array by repeatedly subtracting the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( x + 1 \) from \( x \). However, this approach does not always result in an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The logic for constructing the array and counting the subsequences is flawed, leading to incorrect results for some values of \( X \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus is incorrect.
