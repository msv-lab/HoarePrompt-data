### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to construct an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - The array should have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, and if it's impossible, we should print \(-1\).

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \) and calls the function `func_1`.
   - Inside `func_1`, the program subtracts 1 from \( X \) and initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of the increasing subsequences.
   - It then enters a loop to decompose \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1. This is done to find the lengths of the subsequences that can be used to construct the array.
   - The loop continues until \( x \) becomes 0. In each iteration, it finds the largest \( i \) such that \( 2^{i+1} \leq x + 1 \).
   - It appends \( i \) to `subseq_lens` and subtracts \( 2^i - 1 \) from \( x \).
   - The maximum value of \( i \) found during this process is stored in `mx`.
   - After the loop, it constructs the array `ansv` by first adding the integers from 0 to \( mx-1 \).
   - Then, it appends the values from `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Decomposition**:
     - The program correctly decomposes \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1. This is a valid approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array of length \( n \) can be represented as a sum of binomial coefficients, which are powers of 2 minus 1.
     - The loop ensures that \( x \) is reduced to 0 by subtracting the largest possible \( 2^i - 1 \) in each iteration.
   - **Array Construction**:
     - The array `ansv` is constructed by first adding a sequence of integers from 0 to \( mx-1 \). This ensures that there are \( 2^i \) increasing subsequences for each \( i \) in `subseq_lens`.
     - The additional elements from `subseq_lens` are appended to `ansv` to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.
   - **Length Constraint**:
     - The program ensures that the length of the array is at most 200 by the nature of the decomposition process. The sum of powers of 2 minus 1 will not exceed 200 for \( X \leq 10^{18} \).
   - **Element Range**:
     - The elements of the array are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), which is a valid constraint.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( X = 2 \) by outputting a single element array `[0]`, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element).
   - For larger values of \( X \), the program correctly decomposes \( X \) and constructs the array.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X = 1 \) (which is not in the input range, but it's worth noting).
   - The program does not explicitly check if the constructed array has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, but the decomposition process ensures this.
   - **Bug in Array Construction**:
     - The program appends the values from `subseq_lens` starting from the second element (index 1) in the loop `for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens))`. This means the first element in `subseq_lens` is not included in `ansv`, which can lead to incorrect results.
     - For example, if \( X = 5 \), the program should decompose it as \( 2^2 - 1 + 2^1 - 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \). The `subseq_lens` list would be `[2, 1]`. However, the program only appends `[1]` to `ansv`, resulting in an incorrect array.

### Conclusion:
The program has a bug in the array construction step where it incorrectly omits the first element in `subseq_lens`. This can lead to incorrect results for some values of \( X \). Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
