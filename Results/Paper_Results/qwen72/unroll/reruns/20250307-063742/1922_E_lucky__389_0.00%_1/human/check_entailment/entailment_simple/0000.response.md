### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - The function should handle multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( X \) (2 ≤ \( X \) ≤ 10^18).
   - If no such array exists, the function should print -1.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` starts by reading the integer \( X \) and subtracting 1 from it. This is because the problem considers the empty subsequence as an increasing subsequence, so we need to account for \( X - 1 \) non-empty increasing subsequences.
   - The function then iterates to decompose \( X - 1 \) into a sum of powers of 2. This is done by finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( X \) and subtracting it from \( X \). The length of the subsequence corresponding to this power of 2 is stored in `subseq_lens`.
   - The process continues until \( X \) becomes 0.
   - After the loop, `subseq_lens` contains the lengths of the subsequences that sum up to \( X - 1 \).
   - The function constructs the array `ansv` by first adding integers from 0 to `mx - 1` (where `mx` is the maximum length in `subseq_lens`), and then appending the elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one.
   - Finally, the function prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Subsequence Construction:**
     - The algorithm correctly decomposes \( X - 1 \) into a sum of powers of 2, which is a valid approach to ensure the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).
     - The construction of `ansv` ensures that the array has the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - **Array Length:**
     - The length of `ansv` is `mx + (n - 1)`, where `mx` is the maximum length in `subseq_lens` and `n` is the number of elements in `subseq_lens`.
     - Since `subseq_lens` is derived from the powers of 2, the length of `ansv` will be at most 200, which satisfies the problem's constraint.
   - **Output Format:**
     - The function correctly prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv` in the required format.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - The function handles the case where \( X \) is 2 by printing a single element array `[0]`.
     - For larger values of \( X \), the function constructs the array and prints it correctly.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Handling \( X = 1 \):**
     - The problem states \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \), so \( X = 1 \) is not a valid input. The function correctly handles valid inputs.
   - **Array Element Range:**
     - The elements of `ansv` are constructed to be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), which is valid according to the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly solves the problem by decomposing \( X - 1 \) into a sum of powers of 2 and constructing the array accordingly. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
