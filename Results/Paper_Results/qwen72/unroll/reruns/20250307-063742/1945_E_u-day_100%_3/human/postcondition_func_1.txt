The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`. The specific values or structure of the list are determined by the implementation of `func_1()`, which is not provided in the initial state. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned list, which is the output of `func_1()`.
