To determine what will be printed by the `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the values of the variables involved:

1. **`pos`**: This is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
2. **`low`**: This is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, or `n-1` if no such index exists.
3. **`high`**: This is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, or `n` if no such index exists.
4. **`st`**: This contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution.
5. **`arr[low]` is not equal to `k`**: This means that `arr[low]` is the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`, but it is not equal to `k`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the values:

- **`low + 1`**: Since `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k` and `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, `low + 1` will be the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `k`. If `k` is not found in `arr`, `low` will be `n-1`, so `low + 1` will be `n`.
- **`pos + 1`**: If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` will be the index of the last occurrence of `k`, and `pos + 1` will be the index immediately after the last occurrence of `k`. If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` will be -1, so `pos + 1` will be 0.

Now, let's put this together:

- If `k` is found in `arr`:
  - `low + 1` will be the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `k`.
  - `pos + 1` will be the index immediately after the last occurrence of `k`.

- If `k` is not found in `arr`:
  - `low + 1` will be `n` (since `low` will be `n-1`).
  - `pos + 1` will be 0 (since `pos` will be -1).

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **(low + 1, pos + 1) (where low + 1 is the index of the first element in arr that is greater than k, and pos + 1 is the index immediately after the last occurrence of k, or (n, 0) if k is not found in arr)**
