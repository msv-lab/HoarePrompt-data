The given `print` statement simply prints the integer `1`. The precondition provides detailed information about the state of the program, including the values of `pos`, `low`, `high`, and the contents of `st`, but none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the precondition.

Output: **1**
