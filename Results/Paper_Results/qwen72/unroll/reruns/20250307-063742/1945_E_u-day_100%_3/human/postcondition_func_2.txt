The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It uses the values of `n` and `k` obtained from `func_1` and the list `arr` obtained from `func_2` to find the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` and store it in `pos`. If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` remains -1. The function then performs a binary search to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`. If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, the function prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1 followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. The final state of the program is that `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` (or -1 if `k` is not found), `n` and `arr` remain unchanged, and `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the binary search loop.
