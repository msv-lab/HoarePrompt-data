Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1.**

The initial values of `n` and `k` are still the values returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` remains the list of integers returned by `func_2()`. The variable `pos` is now explicitly set to -1.
