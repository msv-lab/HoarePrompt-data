Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `x` using `func_1` and the permutation `arr` using `func_2`. These functions are correctly implemented to read and parse the input.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`**: In `func_3`, the program iterates through the permutation `arr` to find the index `pos` of the element `x`. This is done correctly using a loop and the condition `if arr[i] == k`.

3. **Binary Search**: The program then performs a binary search to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= x` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > x`. The binary search is implemented correctly with the loop condition `while low + 1 < high` and the midpoint calculation `mid = (low + high) // 2`.

4. **Output**: After the binary search, the program checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `x`. If it is, the program prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed. If not, the program prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, indicating that a single swap is needed to move `x` to the correct position.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop `for _ in range(int(input()))` and calling `func_3` for each test case.

6. **Constraints**: The program adheres to the constraints provided in the problem statement. It performs the binary search and at most one swap, which is within the allowed limit of 2 swaps.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic of the binary search and the swap operation. The binary search is designed to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= x` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > x`. If `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`, the program suggests swapping `arr[low]` with `arr[pos]`. This approach might not always work correctly, especially if the permutation is not sorted or if the binary search does not find the correct position.

To ensure correctness, the binary search should be adjusted to find the correct position of `x` in the sorted order, and the swap should be performed to move `x` to that position. The current implementation might fail in cases where the binary search does not correctly identify the position of `x` due to the unsorted nature of the permutation.

Given the problem constraints and the need to ensure the binary search works correctly, the current implementation is not guaranteed to work for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
