### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Calls:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_3()` for each test case.
   - `func_1()` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   - `func_2()` reads a list of integers `arr` from the input, which is supposed to be a permutation of size `n`.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`:**
   - The program iterates through the list `arr` to find the index `pos` of the element `k`.
   - If `k` is found, `pos` is set to the index of `k`; otherwise, `pos` remains `-1`.

3. **Binary Search:**
   - The program initializes `low` to `0` and `high` to `n`.
   - It performs a binary search to find the position `low` such that `arr[low]` is the largest element less than or equal to `k`, and `high` is the smallest element greater than `k`.
   - The binary search loop continues until `low + 1` is equal to `high`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, the program prints `0` (indicating no swaps are needed).
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, the program prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate a single swap is needed to place `k` at the correct position.

### Issues:

1. **Binary Search Initialization:**
   - The binary search initializes `high` to `n`, which is incorrect. It should be initialized to `n + 1` to match the problem description where `r` is initialized to `n + 1`.

2. **Binary Search Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition `while low + 1 < high` is correct, but the initialization of `high` to `n` will cause issues in the loop.

3. **Output for No Swap Needed:**
   - The program correctly prints `0` if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.

4. **Output for One Swap Needed:**
   - The program correctly prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate the swap needed. However, the indices are off by one because the binary search should be initialized with `high = n + 1`.

### Correctness:

Given the issues with the binary search initialization, the program is not correct. The binary search should be initialized with `high = n + 1` to ensure the correct behavior as described in the problem statement.

### Corrected Program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_3()

def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():
    return list(func_1())

def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    
    low, high = 0, n + 1  # Corrected initialization
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
