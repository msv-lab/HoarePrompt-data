Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= `n` for all 0 <= i < n, and `pos` is an integer that will be the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found.**

Explanation:
- `n` and `k` are updated with the values returned by `func_1()`.
- The initial state of `arr` and `pos` remains unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet.
- `arr` is still a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where each element is between 1 and `n`.
- `pos` is still an integer that will be the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found.
