You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It uses the values of `n` and `k` obtained from `func_1` and the list `arr` obtained from `func_2` to find the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` and store it in `pos`. If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` remains -1. The function then performs a binary search to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`. If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, the function prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1 followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. The final state of the program is that `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` (or -1 if `k` is not found), `n` and `arr` remain unchanged, and `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the binary search loop.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Input**: Multiple test cases, each containing a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to be found.
2. **Task**: Rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that a binary search on the rearranged permutation will find `x` at position `l` after the search.
3. **Output**: The number of swaps `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ 2) and the indices of the swaps.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - It returns a map object of integers.
   - This is a common way to read multiple integers from a single line in Python.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function calls `func_1` and converts the map object to a list.
   - It is used to read the permutation `p` as a list of integers.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - **Input Reading**:
     - Reads `n` and `k` (the length of the permutation and the number to be found).
     - Reads the permutation `arr` as a list of integers.
   - **Finding the Position of `x`**:
     - Initializes `pos` to -1.
     - Iterates through the permutation to find the index `i` where `arr[i] == k`.
     - If `k` is found, `pos` is set to `i`.
   - **Binary Search**:
     - Initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `n`.
     - Uses a while loop to perform binary search.
     - If `arr[mid] > k`, it updates `high` to `mid`.
     - Otherwise, it updates `low` to `mid`.
     - Adds `mid` to a set `st` to keep track of the mid positions.
   - **Output**:
     - If `arr[low] == k`, it prints 0 (no swaps needed).
     - Otherwise, it prints 1 (one swap needed) and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Binary Search Range**:
   - The binary search range is initialized as `(low, high) = (0, n)`, which is correct.
   - The loop condition `while low + 1 < high` ensures that the search continues until `low` and `high` are adjacent.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`**:
   - The program correctly finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic is correct. It updates `low` or `high` based on the comparison with `k`.

4. **Output**:
   - If `arr[low] == k`, it correctly prints 0 (no swaps needed).
   - If `arr[low] != k`, it prints 1 and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to swap the elements at these positions.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program does not handle multiple test cases. It only processes one test case.
   - To handle multiple test cases, the program should be wrapped in a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

2. **Set `st`**:
   - The set `st` is used to keep track of mid positions, but it is not necessary for the problem. It can be removed to simplify the code.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program assumes that `x` is always present in the permutation, which is true based on the problem constraints.
   - It correctly handles the case where `x` is already at the correct position after the binary search.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct for a single test case, but it lacks the ability to handle multiple test cases. To make it fully correct, it should be wrapped in a loop to process each test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

To make it correct, the program should be modified to handle multiple test cases. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():
    return list(func_1())

def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    (low, high) = (0, n)
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)

# Handling multiple test cases
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_3()
```

This version will correctly handle multiple test cases and produce the expected output.
