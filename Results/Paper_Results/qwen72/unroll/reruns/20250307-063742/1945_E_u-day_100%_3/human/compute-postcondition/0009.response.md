Output State: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. `n` and `arr` remain unchanged. `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, or `n-1` if no such index exists. `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, or `n` if no such index exists. `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `pos` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found.
- The variable `n` and the array `arr` remain unchanged.
- The variable `low` ends up being the largest index in the array where the value at that index is less than or equal to `k`, or `n-1` if no such index exists.
- The variable `high` ends up being the smallest index in the array where the value at that index is greater than `k`, or `n` if no such index exists.
- The set `st` contains all the midpoints that were calculated during the loop's execution.
