### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the provided function summary and the original assessment.

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Summary**: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers, returning a map object.
   - **Behavior**: This function is correct and serves to read the input integers efficiently.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Summary**: Calls `func_1` and converts the map object to a list.
   - **Behavior**: This function is also correct and is used to read the permutation `p` as a list of integers.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - **Summary**: Reads `n` and `k`, the length of the permutation and the number to be found. It reads the permutation `arr` and finds the position `pos` of `k` in `arr`. It then performs a binary search to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`. If `arr[low] == k`, it prints 0 (no swaps needed). Otherwise, it prints 1 and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to swap the elements at these positions.
   - **Behavior**:
     - **Input Reading**: Correctly reads `n` and `k` and the permutation `arr`.
     - **Finding the Position of `x`**: Correctly finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation.
     - **Binary Search**:
       - The binary search range is initialized as `(low, high) = (0, n)`, which is correct.
       - The loop condition `while low + 1 < high` ensures that the search continues until `low` and `high` are adjacent.
       - The binary search logic is correct. It updates `low` or `high` based on the comparison with `k`.
     - **Output**:
       - If `arr[low] == k`, it correctly prints 0 (no swaps needed).
       - If `arr[low] != k`, it prints 1 and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to swap the elements at these positions.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the program does not handle multiple test cases. The program should be wrapped in a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - This is a critical issue that must be addressed for the program to be fully correct.

2. **Set `st`**:
   - The set `st` is used to keep track of mid positions, but it is not necessary for the problem. It can be removed to simplify the code.
   - This is a minor issue that does not affect the correctness of the program but can be removed for clarity.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program assumes that `x` is always present in the permutation, which is true based on the problem constraints.
   - It correctly handles the case where `x` is already at the correct position after the binary search.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct for a single test case, but it lacks the ability to handle multiple test cases. This is a significant issue that needs to be addressed. The original assessment is accurate in identifying this problem.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases. To make it correct, it should be modified to handle multiple test cases by wrapping `func_3` in a loop that runs `t` times.

Final: **False**

To make it correct, the program should be modified as follows:

```python
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():
    return list(func_1())

def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    (low, high) = (0, n)
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)

# Handling multiple test cases
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_3()
```
