Based on the initial state provided:

- `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
- `n` and `arr` remain unchanged.
- `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, or `n-1` if no such index exists.
- `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, or `n` if no such index exists.
- `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution.
- Additionally, `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.

The print statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(0)
```

This statement simply prints the integer `0`, regardless of the initial state or any other variables and objects mentioned. The values of `pos`, `n`, `arr`, `low`, `high`, and `st` do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **0**
