### Reasoning:

1. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the program does not handle multiple test cases. The program should be wrapped in a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the program works for all test cases as specified in the problem description.

2. **Set `st`**:
   - The original assessment also correctly noted that the set `st` is unnecessary for the problem. The set is used to keep track of mid positions, but it does not contribute to the solution. Removing it simplifies the code without affecting its correctness.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_3` is correct. It updates `low` or `high` based on the comparison with `k` and continues until `low` and `high` are adjacent.

4. **Finding the Position of `x`**:
   - The program correctly finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation. This is essential for determining the swap indices if `x` is not already at the correct position after the binary search.

5. **Output**:
   - The output logic is correct. If `arr[low] == k`, it prints 0 (no swaps needed). Otherwise, it prints 1 and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to swap the elements at these positions.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the primary issue with the program: it does not handle multiple test cases. This is a significant flaw that would cause the program to fail for the given problem constraints. Additionally, the set `st` is unnecessary and can be removed to simplify the code.

Given these points, the original assessment's conclusion that the program is incorrect is valid. To make the program fully correct, it should be wrapped in a loop to handle multiple test cases.

### Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem description. The corrected version of the program, as suggested in the original assessment, should be used to ensure it works for all test cases.
