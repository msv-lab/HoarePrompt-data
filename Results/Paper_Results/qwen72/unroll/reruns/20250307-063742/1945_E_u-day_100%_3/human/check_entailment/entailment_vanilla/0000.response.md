Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Input**: Multiple test cases, each containing a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to be found.
2. **Task**: Rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that a binary search on the rearranged permutation will find `x` at position `l` after the search.
3. **Output**: The number of swaps `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ 2) and the indices of the swaps.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - It returns a map object of integers.
   - This is a common way to read multiple integers from a single line in Python.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function calls `func_1` and converts the map object to a list.
   - It is used to read the permutation `p` as a list of integers.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - **Input Reading**:
     - Reads `n` and `k` (the length of the permutation and the number to be found).
     - Reads the permutation `arr` as a list of integers.
   - **Finding the Position of `x`**:
     - Initializes `pos` to -1.
     - Iterates through the permutation to find the index `i` where `arr[i] == k`.
     - If `k` is found, `pos` is set to `i`.
   - **Binary Search**:
     - Initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `n`.
     - Uses a while loop to perform binary search.
     - If `arr[mid] > k`, it updates `high` to `mid`.
     - Otherwise, it updates `low` to `mid`.
     - Adds `mid` to a set `st` to keep track of the mid positions.
   - **Output**:
     - If `arr[low] == k`, it prints 0 (no swaps needed).
     - Otherwise, it prints 1 (one swap needed) and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Binary Search Range**:
   - The binary search range is initialized as `(low, high) = (0, n)`, which is correct.
   - The loop condition `while low + 1 < high` ensures that the search continues until `low` and `high` are adjacent.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`**:
   - The program correctly finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic is correct. It updates `low` or `high` based on the comparison with `k`.

4. **Output**:
   - If `arr[low] == k`, it correctly prints 0 (no swaps needed).
   - If `arr[low] != k`, it prints 1 and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to swap the elements at these positions.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program does not handle multiple test cases. It only processes one test case.
   - To handle multiple test cases, the program should be wrapped in a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

2. **Set `st`**:
   - The set `st` is used to keep track of mid positions, but it is not necessary for the problem. It can be removed to simplify the code.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program assumes that `x` is always present in the permutation, which is true based on the problem constraints.
   - It correctly handles the case where `x` is already at the correct position after the binary search.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct for a single test case, but it lacks the ability to handle multiple test cases. To make it fully correct, it should be wrapped in a loop to process each test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

To make it correct, the program should be modified to handle multiple test cases. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():
    return list(func_1())

def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    (low, high) = (0, n)
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)

# Handling multiple test cases
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_3()
```

This version will correctly handle multiple test cases and produce the expected output.
