Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the number of test cases is greater than 1. According to the problem description, the input consists of multiple test cases, and the first line of the input contains the number of test cases `t`. However, the provided program does not read or process this value, and it only handles a single test case. This means that if the input contains more than one test case, the program will fail to process them correctly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
6 5
3 1 6 5 2 4
```

The program will only process the first test case and ignore the second one, leading to incorrect output.
