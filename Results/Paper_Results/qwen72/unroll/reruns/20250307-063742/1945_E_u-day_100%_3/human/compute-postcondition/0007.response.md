Output State: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. `n` and `arr` remain unchanged. `low` is 0, `high` is `n`. `st` is an empty set.**

The code initializes `st` as an empty set, but does not change the values of `pos`, `n`, `arr`, `low`, or `high`. Therefore, the initial state remains valid, with the addition that `st` is now an empty set.
