### Reasoning:

1. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the program does not handle multiple test cases. The program should be wrapped in a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed.

2. **Set `st`**:
   - The set `st` is indeed unnecessary for the problem and can be removed to simplify the code. The original assessment correctly pointed this out.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_3` is correct. It correctly updates `low` and `high` based on the comparison with `k`.

4. **Finding the Position of `x`**:
   - The program correctly finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation. This is essential for determining the swap indices.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints 0 if `arr[low] == k` (no swaps needed).
   - If `arr[low] != k`, it prints 1 and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to swap the elements at these positions. This is the correct approach to ensure that `x` is found at the correct position after the binary search.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is already at the correct position after the binary search.
   - It also correctly handles the case where `x` is not at the correct position by suggesting a swap.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the main issue with the program: it does not handle multiple test cases. The program is otherwise correct for a single test case. To make the program fully correct, it should be modified to handle multiple test cases as shown in the corrected version provided in the original assessment.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the lack of handling multiple test cases, which is a requirement of the problem description.
