Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1()` reads and returns the values of `n` and `k` from the input.
   - `func_2()` reads and returns the permutation `arr` from the input.
   - These functions are correctly implemented to handle the input format as described in the problem.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`**:
   - `func_3()` correctly iterates through the permutation `arr` to find the index `pos` of the last occurrence of `k`.
   - If `k` is not found, `pos` remains -1, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - The binary search is performed with `low` initialized to 0 and `high` initialized to `n`.
   - The loop continues until `low + 1 < high`, which is the correct termination condition for binary search.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated correctly as `(low + high) // 2`.
   - The elements are compared correctly to adjust `low` and `high`.

4. **Output**:
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, the function prints 0, indicating that no swaps are needed.
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, the function prints 1 followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, which suggests a swap to place `k` at the correct position for the binary search.

5. **Swaps**:
   - The problem states that up to 2 swaps can be performed to ensure the binary search finds `k`.
   - The function only performs 1 swap, which is within the allowed limit.
   - The swap is intended to move `k` to the position where the binary search will find it, which is a valid strategy.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `k` is not found in `arr` by setting `pos` to -1 and printing the appropriate indices for a swap.
   - The function also handles the case where `k` is already in the correct position by printing 0.

However, there is a potential issue in the output when `k` is not found in `arr`. The function prints `(low + 1, pos + 1)`, but since `pos` is -1, this would print `(low + 1, 0)`, which is not a valid swap according to the problem statement (indices should be between 1 and n).

Given this, the program is not entirely correct because it can produce invalid output in the case where `k` is not found in `arr`.

Correctness: **False**
