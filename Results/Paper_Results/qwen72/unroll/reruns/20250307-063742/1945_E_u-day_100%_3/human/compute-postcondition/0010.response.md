Postcondition: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. `n` and `arr` remain unchanged. `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, or `n-1` if no such index exists. `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, or `n` if no such index exists. `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution. Additionally, `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.**
