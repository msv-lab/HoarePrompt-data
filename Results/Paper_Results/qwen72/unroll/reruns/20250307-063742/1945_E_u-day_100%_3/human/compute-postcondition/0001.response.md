Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is an integer that will be the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr = func_2()` updates the value of `arr` to the list of integers returned by the function `func_2()`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged and are still the values returned by `func_1()`. The variable `pos` is still intended to be the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, but its value has not been updated by this code snippet.
