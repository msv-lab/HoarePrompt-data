t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and x are integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the permutation and the number to be found, respectively. p is a list of integers of length n, containing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
