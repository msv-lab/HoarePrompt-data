The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is expected to handle multiple test cases internally, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). The function should manage the input and output for these test cases.

Functionality: **The function internally manages multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), and returns the results for these test cases.**
