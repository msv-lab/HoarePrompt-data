Reasoning:

The task is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\), which contains distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program provided prints \(n\) points, all of which are in the first row of the grid (i.e., with coordinates \((1, i)\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n\)).

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Reading Test Cases:**
   - The function `func` reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, each time handling one test case.

2. **Reading and Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the size of the grid.
   - It then prints `n` lines, each containing the coordinates \((1, i)\) for \(i\) from 1 to `n`.

3. **Output Analysis:**
   - The output for each test case is a sequence of points \((1, 1), (1, 2), \ldots, (1, n)\).
   - The Manhattan distance between any two points \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) is \(|1 - 1| + |i - j| = |i - j|\).
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain all possible values of \(|i - j|\) for \(1 \le i, j \le n\).

4. **Maximizing \(\mathcal{H}\):**
   - The possible values of \(|i - j|\) range from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - Therefore, the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) will be \(n\), which is the maximum possible size for a set of distinct Manhattan distances in an \(n \times n\) grid.

5. **Correctness of the Output:**
   - The program correctly prints `n` points for each test case.
   - The points are all in the first row, which ensures that the Manhattan distances are distinct and cover the range from 0 to \(n-1\).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \(n = 2\), the output is \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), which gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\) with size 2.
   - For \(n = 3\), the output is \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((1, 3)\), which gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\) with size 3.
   - For larger \(n\), the same logic applies, and the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) will be \(n\).

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
