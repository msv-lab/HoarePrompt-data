Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases. Specifically, the program always prints points along the first row, which results in a limited set of Manhattan distances. For example, for \(n = 3\), the program outputs:

```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```

The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:

\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|1-1| + |1-2|, |1-1| + |1-3|, |1-1| + |2-3|\} = \{1, 2, 1\} = \{1, 2\}
\]

However, the problem description requires maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). For \(n = 3\), the optimal arrangement should yield a set \(\mathcal{H}\) with 4 distinct distances, as shown in the example:

\[
\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}
\]

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
