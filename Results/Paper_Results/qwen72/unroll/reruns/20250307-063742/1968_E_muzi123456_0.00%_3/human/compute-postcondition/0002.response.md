Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations, and `t` is now 0. For each test case, the output includes a sequence of numbers starting from '1 1' to '1 n', followed by a single space.**

Natural language description: After the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable `t` is reduced to 0. For each test case defined by the integer `n`, the loop prints a sequence of numbers where each number from 1 to `n` is prefixed by '1' and separated by a space. After printing the sequence for each test case, a single space is printed. This process is repeated for all `t` test cases.
