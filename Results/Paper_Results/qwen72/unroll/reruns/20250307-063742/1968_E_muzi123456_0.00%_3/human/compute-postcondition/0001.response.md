The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be non-zero. Since `t` is an input integer, it can be any integer, but for the loop to execute, it must be a non-zero integer.

State: **`func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). The function should internally manage the input and output for these test cases. `t` must be a non-zero integer.**
