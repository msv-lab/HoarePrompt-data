Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) and prints a sequence of lines. Each line in the sequence contains the number '1' followed by a space and then the integer `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n). After processing all test cases, the function completes and `t` is 0. The function does not return any value. **
