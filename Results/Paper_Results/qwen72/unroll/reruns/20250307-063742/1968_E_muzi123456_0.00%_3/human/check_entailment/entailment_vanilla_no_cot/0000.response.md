Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program only prints points along the first row of the grid, which does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. To maximize \(\mathcal{H}\), the points should be chosen in such a way that the variety of Manhattan distances between any pair of points is maximized. The program's approach of placing all points in the first row will result in a limited set of distances, primarily just the differences in the column indices.

For example, for \(n = 3\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is \(\{1, 2\}\), which has a size of 2. However, the optimal solution for \(n = 3\) can achieve a set \(\mathcal{H}\) with a size of 4, as shown in the problem description.

A correct solution would need to place points in a way that maximizes the variety of Manhattan distances. One common approach is to place points in a pattern that covers both rows and columns more effectively, such as placing points in a diagonal or a specific pattern that ensures a wide range of distances.
