Reasoning:

The given problem requires selecting \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized. The provided program, however, always prints the cells along the first row of the grid, i.e., it prints the coordinates \((1, i)\) for \( i \) ranging from 1 to \( n \).

Let's analyze the program's output for different values of \( n \):

1. **For \( n = 2 \)**:
   - The program outputs: 
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     ```
   - The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{ |1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |1-2| \} = \{0, 1\}\).
   - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 2, which is correct for \( n = 2 \).

2. **For \( n = 3 \)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     1 3
     ```
   - The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is:
     \[
     \{ |1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |1-2|, |1-1| + |1-3|, |1-1| + |2-1|, |1-1| + |2-2|, |1-1| + |2-3|, |1-1| + |3-1|, |1-1| + |3-2|, |1-1| + |3-3| \}
     = \{0, 1, 2\}
     \]
   - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 3, which is not the maximum possible size for \( n = 3 \). The maximum possible size is 4, as shown in the example.

3. **For \( n = 4 \)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     1 3
     1 4
     ```
   - The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is:
     \[
     \{ |1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |1-2|, |1-1| + |1-3|, |1-1| + |1-4|, |1-1| + |2-1|, |1-1| + |2-2|, |1-1| + |2-3|, |1-1| + |2-4|, \ldots, |1-1| + |4-4| \}
     = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}
     \]
   - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 4, which is not the maximum possible size for \( n = 4 \). The maximum possible size is 6, as shown in the example.

4. **For \( n = 5 \)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     1 3
     1 4
     1 5
     ```
   - The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is:
     \[
     \{ |1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |1-2|, |1-1| + |1-3|, |1-1| + |1-4|, |1-1| + |1-5|, |1-1| + |2-1|, |1-1| + |2-2|, \ldots, |1-1| + |5-5| \}
     = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}
     \]
   - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 5, which is not the maximum possible size for \( n = 5 \). The maximum possible size is 8, as shown in the example.

5. **For \( n = 6 \)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     1 3
     1 4
     1 5
     1 6
     ```
   - The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is:
     \[
     \{ |1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |1-2|, |1-1| + |1-3|, |1-1| + |1-4|, |1-1| + |1-5|, |1-1| + |1-6|, |1-1| + |2-1|, |1-1| + |2-2|, \ldots, |1-1| + |6-6| \}
     = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}
     \]
   - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 6, which is not the maximum possible size for \( n = 6 \). The maximum possible size is 10, as shown in the example.

The program consistently prints cells along the first row, which results in a set of Manhattan distances that is not maximized. For larger \( n \), the program's output does not achieve the maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
