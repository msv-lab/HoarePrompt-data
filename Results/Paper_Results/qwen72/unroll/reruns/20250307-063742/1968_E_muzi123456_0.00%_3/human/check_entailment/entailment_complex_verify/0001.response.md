### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to choose \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \).
   - It then prints \( n \) points, all of which have the same \( x \)-coordinate (1) and different \( y \)-coordinates ranging from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Manhattan Distance Calculation**:
   - If all points have the same \( x \)-coordinate (1), the Manhattan distance between any two points \((1, y_1)\) and \((1, y_2)\) simplifies to \( |y_1 - y_2| \).
   - The set of distinct Manhattan distances will be the set of all possible differences between the \( y \)-coordinates, which are \( \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\} \).

4. **Maximizing the Set of Distinct Manhattan Distances**:
   - The set \( \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\} \) contains \( n \) distinct values.
   - However, the problem requires maximizing the size of the set \( \mathcal{H} \), which should ideally contain more than just \( n \) distinct values.
   - To achieve this, we need to consider points that are spread out both horizontally and vertically. For example, for \( n = 3 \), the points \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\) yield a set of distinct Manhattan distances \( \{0, 1, 2, 3\} \), which has 4 elements.

5. **Optimal Solution**:
   - The program only prints points with the same \( x \)-coordinate, which limits the number of distinct Manhattan distances to \( n \) instead of potentially more.
   - An optimal solution would involve placing points in a way that maximizes the variety of \( x \)- and \( y \)-coordinate differences, thus increasing the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not maximize the size of the set \( \mathcal{H} \) as required by the problem.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.
