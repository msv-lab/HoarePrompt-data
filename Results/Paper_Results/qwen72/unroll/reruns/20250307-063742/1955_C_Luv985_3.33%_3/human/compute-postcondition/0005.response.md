Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of ships and a number of attacks by the Kraken. For each test case, it takes the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`, along with a list of the ships' durability values. The function then simulates the attacks, where the Kraken can either attack two ships at once or a single ship, reducing their durability accordingly. The final output for each test case is the number of ships that are destroyed after all the attacks. The function does not return any value; it prints the result for each test case. **
