The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `T` is an input integer. To ensure that the loop executes at least once, `T` must be greater than 0.

State: **The function should take three parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) representing the number of ships and the number of attacks by the Kraken, respectively; and a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the durability of the ships. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `T` must be greater than 0.**
