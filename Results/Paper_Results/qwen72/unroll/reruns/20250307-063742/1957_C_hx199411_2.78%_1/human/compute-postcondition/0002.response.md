Output State: **t = 0, n and k are unchanged for the last test case, num is the final count of moves, m is the remaining moves, and dp contains the computed dynamic programming array for the last test case.**

### Explanation:
- **t = 0**: The loop runs `t` times, and after each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, after all iterations, `t` will be 0.
- **n and k are unchanged for the last test case**: The values of `n` and `k` are set at the beginning of each iteration based on the input, so they will be the values from the last test case when the loop finishes.
- **num is the final count of moves**: `num` is incremented based on the moves read during the last test case. It will hold the final count of moves for that test case.
- **m is the remaining moves**: `m` is calculated as `n - num` and will be the remaining moves for the last test case.
- **dp contains the computed dynamic programming array for the last test case**: The `dp` array is computed based on the value of `m` for the last test case. It will contain the values of the dynamic programming array up to `m + 1` for the last test case.
