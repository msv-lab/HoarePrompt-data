### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` representing the moves made.

2. **Move Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of moves `num` that have been made so far.
   - If `r_i == c_i`, it increments `num` by 1 (since the computer skips its turn).
   - If `r_i != c_i`, it increments `num` by 2 (one move by the player and one mirrored move by the computer).

3. **Remaining Moves**:
   - The program calculates the remaining moves `m` as `n - num`.
   - If `m` is 0, it prints 0 (no more moves can be made).
   - If `m` is 1, it prints 1 (only one configuration is possible).

4. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - For `m` greater than 1, the program uses dynamic programming to compute the number of possible final configurations.
   - It initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0.
   - It sets `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` (base cases for 1 and 2 remaining moves).
   - It then iterates from 3 to `m`, updating `dp[i]` using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the number of ways to place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other, considering the mirrored moves.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle the input, calculate the number of moves, and use dynamic programming to compute the number of possible final configurations. The logic and the dynamic programming approach are consistent with the problem description and the constraints provided.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
