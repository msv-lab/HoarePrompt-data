The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Since `t` is already guaranteed to be within this range, it is non-zero and the loop can certainly execute at least once.

State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each move (r_i, c_i) is a pair of integers where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and all moves are valid according to the game rules.**
