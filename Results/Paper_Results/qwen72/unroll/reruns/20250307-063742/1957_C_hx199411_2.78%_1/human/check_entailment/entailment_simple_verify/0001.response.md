### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a chessboard where you and the computer take turns placing rooks.
   - You place a white rook, and the computer places a black rook at the mirrored position.
   - If the mirrored position is the same as the original position (i.e., \( r = c \)), the computer skips its turn.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations of the board after all possible moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the board \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \) already made.
   - It then reads the \( k \) moves and processes them.

3. **Tracking the Number of Rooks:**
   - The variable `num` is used to count the number of rooks already placed on the board.
   - For each move, if the rook is placed on the diagonal (i.e., \( c == r \)), `num` is incremented by 1.
   - If the rook is not on the diagonal, `num` is incremented by 2 because the computer places a rook at the mirrored position.
   - This part of the program is correct and accurately tracks the number of rooks placed.

4. **Calculating Remaining Positions:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as \( n - num \), which represents the number of remaining positions where rooks can be placed.
   - If `m` is 0, it means the board is already full, and there are no more moves possible, so the output is 0.
   - If `m` is 1, it means there is only one remaining position, and the only configuration is placing a rook there, so the output is 1.
   - This part of the program is also correct.

5. **Dynamic Programming for Remaining Configurations:**
   - For \( m \geq 2 \), the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of different final configurations.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation is \( dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) \).
   - This relation is derived from the fact that a rook can be placed in a new row or column, and the computer will place a rook in the mirrored position, leading to different configurations.
   - The recurrence relation is correct and efficiently calculates the number of configurations.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final value of `dp[m]` for each test case, which represents the number of different final configurations.
   - The output is correctly formatted and modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) is applied to ensure the result is within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of different final configurations of the chessboard based on the given problem description. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for calculating the configurations, and the modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required range.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
