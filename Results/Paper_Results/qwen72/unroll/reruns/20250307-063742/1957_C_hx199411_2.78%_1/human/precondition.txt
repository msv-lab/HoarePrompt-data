t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, n and k are integers where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n, and each of the k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, representing the moves made. The k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
