Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations of rooks on an n x n chessboard after a series of moves, where the moves are mirrored by the computer. The program uses dynamic programming to compute the number of valid configurations for the remaining moves.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.

2. **Counting Initial Moves**: The program counts the number of moves `num` that have been made, including the mirrored moves by the computer. If a move is on the diagonal (i.e., `r_i == c_i`), it counts as one move. Otherwise, it counts as two moves (one for the player and one for the computer).

3. **Calculating Remaining Moves**: The program calculates the remaining moves `m` as `n - num`. This is correct because `num` includes both the player's moves and the computer's mirrored moves.

4. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized correctly with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. These base cases are correct:
   - `dp[1] = 1` because with one remaining move, there is only one configuration (placing a rook on the only available cell).
   - `dp[2] = 3` because with two remaining moves, there are three configurations: two where the rooks are placed in different rows and columns, and one where they are placed on the diagonal.

5. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is correct. This formula accounts for:
   - Placing a rook in a new row and column, which leaves `i-1` remaining moves.
   - Placing a rook in a new row and column, and then placing another rook in the remaining `i-2` moves, with the factor of 2 accounting for the two possible ways to place the rooks.

6. **Output**: The program prints the final result `dp[m]` for each test case, which is the number of different final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
