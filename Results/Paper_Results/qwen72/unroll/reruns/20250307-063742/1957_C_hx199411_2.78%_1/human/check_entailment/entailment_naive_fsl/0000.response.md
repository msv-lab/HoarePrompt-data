Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the initial moves (r, c) and (c, r) are such that they do not occupy the same row or column, but the remaining available positions for placing rooks are limited in a way that affects the number of final configurations. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that after the initial k moves, the remaining positions for placing rooks must also ensure that no two rooks attack each other.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 2
1 2
2 1
```
After the initial 2 moves, the board looks like this:
```
W . . .
. B . .
. . . .
. . . .
```
The program calculates `num` as 2 (since both moves are mirrored and do not occupy the same row or column), and then calculates the number of configurations for the remaining 2 positions (n - num = 4 - 2 = 2). However, the program's dynamic programming (DP) approach assumes that the remaining positions are independent, which is not true in this case. The remaining positions (3, 4) and (4, 3) are not independent because placing a rook in one of these positions will prevent the computer from placing a rook in the mirrored position.

The correct number of configurations for this example should be 1 (placing a rook at (3, 3) and (4, 4)), but the program will output 3, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not handle this edge case correctly.
