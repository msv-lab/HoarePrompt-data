Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each move (r_i, c_i) is a pair of integers where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and all moves are valid according to the game rules.**

The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input, which must be within the range 1 to 10^4. The other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.
