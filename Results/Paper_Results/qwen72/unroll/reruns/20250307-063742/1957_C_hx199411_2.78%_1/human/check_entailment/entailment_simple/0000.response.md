### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.
   - It then reads the `k` moves, which are pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)`.

2. **Move Counting:**
   - The program initializes `num` to 0, which is used to count the number of positions already occupied by rooks (either by the player or the computer).
   - For each move `(r_i, c_i)`, if `r_i == c_i`, it increments `num` by 1 (since the computer skips its turn if `r_i == c_i`).
   - If `r_i != c_i`, it increments `num` by 2 (one for the player's move and one for the computer's mirrored move).

3. **Remaining Moves Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `m` as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions on the board that can be occupied by rooks.

4. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0.
   - It sets `dp[1]` to 1 and `dp[2]` to 3, which are the base cases for the DP.
   - For each `i` from 3 to `m + 1`, it updates `dp[i]` using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
   - This formula accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions, considering the constraints of the game.

5. **Output:**
   - If `m == 0`, it prints 0 (no remaining moves).
   - If `m == 1`, it prints 1 (only one way to place the last rook).
   - Otherwise, it prints `dp[m]`, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the input, counts the number of occupied positions, and uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible final configurations. The logic and the DP formula are appropriate for the problem, and the modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required range.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
