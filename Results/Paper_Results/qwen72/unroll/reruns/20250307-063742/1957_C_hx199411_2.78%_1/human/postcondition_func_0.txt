The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)`. It calculates the number of moves `num` based on the pairs, and then computes the remaining moves `m` as `n - num`. If `m` is 0, it prints 0. If `m` is 1, it prints 1. For `m` greater than 1, it uses dynamic programming to compute and print a result based on the number of remaining moves. After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, and the function does not return any value.
