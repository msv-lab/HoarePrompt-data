Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the size of a chessboard and the number of rooks, respectively. It then reads `k` pairs of integers, each representing a move of a rook on the chessboard. The function calculates the number of ways to place the remaining rooks on the chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other, and prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` being 0. **
