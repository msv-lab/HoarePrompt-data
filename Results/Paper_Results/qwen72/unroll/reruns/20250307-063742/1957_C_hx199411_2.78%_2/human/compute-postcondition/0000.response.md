Output State: **t is an input integer, n and k are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each of the k moves is represented by two integers r_i and c_i, ensuring that the moves are valid and do not result in rooks attacking each other.**

The value of `t` is updated to the integer input provided. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
