Correctness: **True**

The program provided appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and requirements. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case, including the size of the chessboard and the number of initial moves.

2. **Tracking Mirrored Moves**: The program tracks the number of moves where the row and column are the same (`c == r`) and where they are different (`c != r`). This is necessary to determine how many positions are already occupied or mirrored, which affects the number of remaining valid moves.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible final configurations. The DP array `dp` is initialized with base cases:
   - `dp[1] = 1`: There is only one way to place a rook in a 1x1 board.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: There are three ways to place rooks in a 2x2 board (one rook in each cell, or two rooks in the diagonal cells).

4. **DP Transition**: The transition for the DP array is calculated as:
   - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`: This formula correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in an `i x i` board, considering the previous configurations and the mirrored moves.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The program handles all the given constraints and edge cases, and the logic appears to be sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
