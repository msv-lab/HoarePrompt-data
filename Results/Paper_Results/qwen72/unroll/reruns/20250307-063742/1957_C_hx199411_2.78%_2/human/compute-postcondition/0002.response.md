Output State: **t is 0, and the loop has executed all the iterations.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of the variable `t` is reduced to 0, indicating that the loop has completed all the test cases it was supposed to run. The variables `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` are updated within each iteration of the loop based on the input and the logic inside the loop, but their final values depend on the last test case processed. The `dp` array, which is used to compute the number of ways to place rooks on a chessboard, is also updated during each iteration but is reset for each new test case. Therefore, the only consistent change across all iterations is that `t` becomes 0.
