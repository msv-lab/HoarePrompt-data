### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem involves a chessboard of size \( n \times n \).
   - You and the computer take turns placing rooks (white and black, respectively) such that no two rooks share the same row or column.
   - The computer mirrors your move by placing a black rook at the position \((c, r)\) if you place a white rook at \((r, c)\).
   - If \( r = c \), the computer skips its turn.
   - The task is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), the size of the chessboard and the number of initial moves.
   - It then reads \( k \) pairs of integers \((r_i, c_i)\) representing the initial moves.

3. **Counting Initial Moves**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of initial moves where \( r_i = c_i \) (diagonal moves) and where \( r_i \neq c_i \) (non-diagonal moves).
   - Each diagonal move \((r_i, c_i)\) where \( r_i = c_i \) results in one rook being placed.
   - Each non-diagonal move \((r_i, c_i)\) results in two rooks being placed (one by you and one by the computer).

4. **Calculating Remaining Moves**:
   - The program calculates the number of remaining positions \( m \) where no rooks have been placed.
   - \( m = n - \text{num} \), where \(\text{num}\) is the total number of rooks placed by the initial moves.

5. **Dynamic Programming for Remaining Moves**:
   - The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks.
   - \( dp[i] \) represents the number of ways to place \( i \) rooks on an \( i \times i \) board such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The base cases are:
     - \( dp[1] = 1 \) (one way to place one rook on a \( 1 \times 1 \) board).
     - \( dp[2] = 3 \) (three ways to place two rooks on a \( 2 \times 2 \) board).
   - The recurrence relation is:
     - \( dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2 \) (place one rook in the first row and then place the remaining rooks in the remaining \( (i-1) \times (i-1) \) board, or place two rooks in the first two rows and then place the remaining rooks in the remaining \( (i-2) \times (i-2) \) board).

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is \( dp[m] \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Analysis of the Program:
- **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- **Counting Initial Moves**: The program correctly counts the number of rooks placed by the initial moves.
- **Calculating Remaining Moves**: The calculation of \( m \) is correct.
- **Dynamic Programming**:
  - The base cases \( dp[1] = 1 \) and \( dp[2] = 3 \) are correct.
  - The recurrence relation \( dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2 \) is correct and follows the problem's constraints.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. The dynamic programming approach and the logic for counting initial moves are both implemented correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
