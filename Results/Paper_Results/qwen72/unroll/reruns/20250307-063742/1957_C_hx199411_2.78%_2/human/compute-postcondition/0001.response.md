The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is truthy (non-zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer, which means it can be any integer. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each of the k moves is represented by two integers r_i and c_i, ensuring that the moves are valid and do not result in rooks attacking each other.**
