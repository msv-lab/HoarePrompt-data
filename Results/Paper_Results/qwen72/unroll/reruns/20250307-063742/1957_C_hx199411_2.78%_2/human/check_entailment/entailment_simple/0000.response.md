### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads the `k` moves, each represented by a pair of integers `(r, c)`.

2. **Move Counting**:
   - The program initializes a variable `num` to count the number of moves that have been played, including the computer's mirrored moves.
   - For each move `(r, c)`, if `r == c`, it increments `num` by 1 (since the computer skips its turn).
   - If `r != c`, it increments `num` by 2 (one move by the player and one mirrored move by the computer).

3. **Remaining Moves**:
   - The program calculates `m` as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.

4. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - It initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0.
   - `dp[1]` is set to 1, representing the base case where there is only one position left.
   - `dp[2]` is set to 3, representing the base case where there are two positions left.
   - For `i` from 3 to `m + 1`, it calculates `dp[i]` using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
     This formula accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, considering the constraints of the problem.

5. **Output**:
   - If `m` is 0, it prints 0 (no remaining positions).
   - If `m` is 1, it prints 1 (only one way to place the rook).
   - Otherwise, it prints `dp[m]`, the number of possible final configurations for the remaining positions.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified.
- The dynamic programming approach used is appropriate for the problem, and the formula used to calculate `dp[i]` is correct.
- The program correctly accounts for the mirrored moves and the constraints of the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
