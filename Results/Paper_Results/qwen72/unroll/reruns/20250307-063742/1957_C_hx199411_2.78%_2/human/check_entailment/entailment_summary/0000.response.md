### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers `(c, r)` representing the moves made by the player.

2. **Counting Initial Moves:**
   - The function counts the number of moves where the player places a rook on the diagonal (i.e., `c == r`), which results in the computer skipping its turn.
   - For non-diagonal moves, the function counts each move and its mirrored move by the computer, effectively reducing the number of available positions by 2.

3. **Dynamic Programming for Remaining Moves:**
   - The function initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` to store the number of valid configurations for different numbers of remaining positions.
   - It sets the base cases: `dp[1] = 1` (one position left, one way to place a rook) and `dp[2] = 3` (two positions left, three ways to place rooks).
   - For each subsequent position `i` from 3 to `m` (where `m` is the number of remaining positions), it calculates the number of valid configurations using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for placing a rook in one of the remaining positions and the mirrored position, ensuring no two rooks attack each other.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is the number of valid configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Initial Move Counting:**
  - The function correctly counts the number of diagonal moves and non-diagonal moves, reducing the number of available positions accordingly.
- **Correctness of DP Calculation:**
  - The DP array is correctly initialized and the recurrence relation is appropriate for the problem.
  - The formula ensures that the configurations are counted correctly, considering both the placement of a rook and its mirrored position.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles edge cases where `m` is 0 or 1, printing the correct results (0 and 1, respectively).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes the moves, and calculates the number of valid configurations using dynamic programming. The execution summary confirms that the function processes all test cases and prints the results as expected.

### Correctness:
**True**
