Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of moves `k` is 0. According to the problem description, if `k` is 0, the initial state of the board should be empty, and the number of possible final configurations should be calculated based on the entire `n x n` board. However, the current implementation of the program assumes that at least one move has been made, and it calculates the number of configurations based on the number of moves already played. When `k` is 0, the program will not correctly initialize the `num` variable, leading to an incorrect result.

Example Input:
```
1
4 0
```

Expected Output:
```
10
```

Actual Output (from the program):
```
0
```

This is because the program incorrectly initializes `num` to 0 and then subtracts `num` from `n` to get `m`, which remains `n` in this case. The program then incorrectly handles the case where `m` is 0, printing 0 instead of the correct number of configurations.
