The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided snippet, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters related to the setup of a chessboard and the moves of rooks. Specifically, it accepts:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`: An integer representing the size of the chessboard (n x n), where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5.
- `k`: An integer representing the number of rooks, where 0 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `moves`: A list of k moves, each represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, ensuring that the moves are valid and do not result in rooks attacking each other.

The function returns the result of each test case, which is not explicitly defined in the output section. However, given the context, it is reasonable to infer that the function returns some information about the state of the chessboard after the rooks have been placed according to the valid moves.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` representing the size of the chessboard, an integer `k` representing the number of rooks, and a list of `k` moves, each move represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`. The function returns the result of each test case, which is some information about the state of the chessboard after placing the rooks according to the valid moves.**
