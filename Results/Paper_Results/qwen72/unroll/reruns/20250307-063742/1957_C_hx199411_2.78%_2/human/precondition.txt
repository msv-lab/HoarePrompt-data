t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each of the k moves is represented by two integers r_i and c_i such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and the moves are valid (no two rooks attack each other). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.
