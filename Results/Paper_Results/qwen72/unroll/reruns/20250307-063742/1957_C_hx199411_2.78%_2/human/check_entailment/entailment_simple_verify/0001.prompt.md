You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem involves a chessboard of size \( n \times n \).
   - You and the computer take turns placing rooks (white and black, respectively) such that no two rooks share the same row or column.
   - The computer mirrors your move by placing a black rook at the position \((c, r)\) if you place a white rook at \((r, c)\).
   - If \( r = c \), the computer skips its turn.
   - The task is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), the size of the chessboard and the number of initial moves.
   - It then reads \( k \) pairs of integers \((r_i, c_i)\) representing the initial moves.

3. **Counting Initial Moves**:
   - The program counts the number of initial moves where \( r_i = c_i \) (diagonal moves) and where \( r_i \neq c_i \) (non-diagonal moves).
   - Each diagonal move \((r_i, c_i)\) where \( r_i = c_i \) results in one rook being placed.
   - Each non-diagonal move \((r_i, c_i)\) results in two rooks being placed (one by you and one by the computer).

4. **Calculating Remaining Moves**:
   - The program calculates the number of remaining positions \( m \) where no rooks have been placed.
   - \( m = n - \text{num} \), where \(\text{num}\) is the total number of rooks placed by the initial moves.

5. **Dynamic Programming for Remaining Moves**:
   - The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks.
   - \( dp[i] \) represents the number of ways to place \( i \) rooks on an \( i \times i \) board such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The base cases are:
     - \( dp[1] = 1 \) (one way to place one rook on a \( 1 \times 1 \) board).
     - \( dp[2] = 3 \) (three ways to place two rooks on a \( 2 \times 2 \) board).
   - The recurrence relation is:
     - \( dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2 \) (place one rook in the first row and then place the remaining rooks in the remaining \( (i-1) \times (i-1) \) board, or place two rooks in the first two rows and then place the remaining rooks in the remaining \( (i-2) \times (i-2) \) board).

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is \( dp[m] \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly parses the input and counts the number of initial moves.
- It correctly calculates the number of remaining positions \( m \).
- The dynamic programming approach is correct for calculating the number of ways to place the remaining rooks.
- The base cases and recurrence relation are correctly implemented.
- The program handles the modulo operation to ensure the result is within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
