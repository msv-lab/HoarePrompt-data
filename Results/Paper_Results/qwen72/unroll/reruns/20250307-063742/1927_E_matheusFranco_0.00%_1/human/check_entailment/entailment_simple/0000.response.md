Reasoning:

The program's goal is to generate a k-level permutation for each test case, where the difference between any two sums of continuous segments of length k is no more than 1. The program reads multiple test cases and for each, it constructs a permutation using the `func_1` function.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
1. **Input Reading**: The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
2. **Permutation Initialization**: It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
3. **Filling the Permutation**:
   - The function uses a loop to fill the permutation in a specific pattern.
   - For each `i` in the range `[0, k)`, it sets `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` to `curr_v`, where `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at `i` and increments by `k` until it exceeds `n`.
   - This pattern ensures that the values `1` to `k` are distributed evenly across the permutation, repeating every `k` elements.
4. **Output**: The function prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
1. **Test Case Count**: The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: It enters a loop that runs `t` times.
3. **Call `func_1`**: For each test case, it calls `func_1` to generate and print the permutation.
4. **Decrement Test Case Counter**: It decrements `t` after each test case.

### Issues:
1. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly construct a k-level permutation. The pattern it uses to fill the permutation does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - Specifically, the pattern `1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1` (for `k=3`) does not satisfy the k-level condition because the sums of segments will vary more than 1.

2. **Correct Pattern**:
   - A correct approach to construct a k-level permutation is to alternate between the first half and the second half of the numbers from 1 to `n`. For example, for `n=10` and `k=4`, a valid permutation could be `1 6 2 5 3 4 7 8 9 10`.
   - This ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` are as balanced as possible.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly construct a k-level permutation, and therefore the program as a whole is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
