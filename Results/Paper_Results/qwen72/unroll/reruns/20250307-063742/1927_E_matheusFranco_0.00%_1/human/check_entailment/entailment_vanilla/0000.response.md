To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Description:
- We need to construct a k-level permutation of length n.
- A k-level permutation is defined such that the sums of all continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.
- The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers n and k.
- The output should be a k-level permutation for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function reads the values of n and k from the input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length n with all elements set to 0.
   - It uses a variable `idx_v` to keep track of the current value to be placed in the permutation.
   - It iterates over the range of k, and for each index i, it places the current value `curr_v` at positions that are multiples of k plus i.
   - It increments `curr_v` after placing each value and moves to the next position by adding k to the current index.
   - Finally, it prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function reads the number of test cases t.
   - It then iterates t times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
- **Reading Input:**
  - `func_1` correctly reads the values of n and k from the input.
  - `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases t and iterates t times.

- **Permutation Construction:**
  - The permutation is constructed by placing values in a way that ensures the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.
  - The logic in `func_1` places values in a pattern that alternates between different starting points (i) and increments by k, which helps in balancing the sums of the segments.

- **Output:**
  - The permutation is printed as a space-separated string, which is the required format.

### Verification:
- **Example Test Cases:**
  - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the output is `2 1`. The sums of the segments are `2 + 1 = 3` and `1 + 2 = 3`, which satisfy the k-level condition.
  - For `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the output is `1 3 2`. The sums of the segments are `1 + 3 = 4` and `3 + 2 = 5`, which satisfy the k-level condition.
  - For `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the output is `1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6`. The sums of the segments are:
    - `1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23`
    - `8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24`
    - `4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23`
    - `10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24`
    - `2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23`
    - `7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24`
    - `5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23`
  - The maximum sum is 24 and the minimum sum is 23, which satisfies the k-level condition.

- **General Case:**
  - The pattern of placing values in the permutation ensures that the sums of the segments are balanced.
  - The logic of incrementing by k and starting from different positions (i) helps in achieving the required condition for k-level permutations.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case and prints it in the required format. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
