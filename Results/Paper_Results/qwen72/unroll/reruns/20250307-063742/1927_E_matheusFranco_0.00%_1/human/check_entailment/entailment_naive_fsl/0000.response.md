Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the construction of a k-level permutation for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not ensure that the permutation is a valid k-level permutation as defined in the problem description. 

For example, consider the input `n = 10` and `k = 4`. The program generates the permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. However, this permutation does not satisfy the k-level condition. The sums of the continuous segments of length 4 are:
- `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`
- `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14`
- `3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18`
- `4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22`
- `5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26`
- `6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 30`
- `7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 34`

The maximum sum is 34 and the minimum sum is 10, and the difference is 24, which is much greater than 1. Therefore, the permutation is not k-level.

A correct approach would involve a more sophisticated method to ensure that the sums of the continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1. For example, alternating high and low values in the permutation can help achieve this.
