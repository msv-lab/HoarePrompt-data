Output State: **t is 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` will be 0. This is because the loop continues to run as long as `t` is greater than 0, and in each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Once `t` reaches 0, the condition `t > 0` becomes false, and the loop terminates. The state of any other variables that are not modified within the loop remains unchanged.
