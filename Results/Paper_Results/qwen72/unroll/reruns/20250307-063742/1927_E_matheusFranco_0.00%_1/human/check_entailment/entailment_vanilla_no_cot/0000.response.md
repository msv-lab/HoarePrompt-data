Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case, decrementing `t` each time. This correctly handles multiple test cases.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - `func_1` reads the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the `permutation` list in a way that ensures the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

3. **Filling the Permutation**:
   - The loop `for i in range(k)` iterates over each possible starting position for segments of length `k`.
   - Inside this loop, another loop `while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` fills the `permutation` list at positions that are multiples of `k` plus the current `i` value.
   - This ensures that the values are distributed in a pattern that maintains the required condition for a `k`-level permutation.

4. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation is printed as a space-separated string.

The logic of the program ensures that the sums of the continuous segments of length `k` will differ by at most 1, which is the requirement for a `k`-level permutation. Given the constraints, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.
