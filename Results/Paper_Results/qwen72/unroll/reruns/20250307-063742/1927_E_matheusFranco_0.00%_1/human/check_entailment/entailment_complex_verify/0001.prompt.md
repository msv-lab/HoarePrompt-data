You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. It generates a permutation list of length `n` where the first `k` values are filled with the sequence 1 to `k` in a repeating pattern. The final state of the program is that `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the `permutation` list is printed as a space-separated string of integers. The function does not return any value.

        t -= 1
        
    #State: t is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It repeatedly calls the function `func_1` a number of times specified by user input. After all calls to `func_1` are completed, the function terminates with the variable `t` set to 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Description:
- We need to construct a k-level permutation of length n.
- A k-level permutation is defined such that the sums of all continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.
- The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers n and k.
- The output should be a k-level permutation for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function reads the values of n and k from the input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length n with all elements set to 0.
   - It uses a variable `idx_v` to keep track of the current value to be placed in the permutation.
   - It iterates over the range of k, and for each index i, it places the current value `curr_v` at positions that are multiples of k plus i.
   - It increments `curr_v` after placing each value and moves to the next position by adding k to the current index.
   - Finally, it prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function reads the number of test cases t.
   - It then iterates t times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
- **Reading Input:**
  - `func_1` correctly reads the values of n and k from the input.
  - `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases t and iterates t times.

- **Permutation Construction:**
  - The permutation is constructed by placing values in a way that ensures the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.
  - The logic in `func_1` places values in a pattern that alternates between different starting points (i) and increments by k, which helps in balancing the sums of the segments.

- **Output:**
  - The permutation is printed as a space-separated string, which is the required format.

### Verification:
- **Example Test Cases:**
  - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the output is `2 1`. The sums of the segments are `2 + 1 = 3` and `1 + 2 = 3`, which satisfy the k-level condition.
  - For `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the output is `1 3 2`. The sums of the segments are `1 + 3 = 4` and `3 + 2 = 5`, which satisfy the k-level condition.
  - For `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the output is `1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6`. The sums of the segments are:
    - `1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23`
    - `8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24`
    - `4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23`
    - `10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24`
    - `2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23`
    - `7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24`
    - `5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23`
  - The maximum sum is 24 and the minimum sum is 23, which satisfies the k-level condition.

- **General Case:**
  - The pattern of placing values in the permutation ensures that the sums of the segments are balanced.
  - The logic of incrementing by k and starting from different positions (i) helps in achieving the required condition for k-level permutations.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case and prints it in the required format. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
