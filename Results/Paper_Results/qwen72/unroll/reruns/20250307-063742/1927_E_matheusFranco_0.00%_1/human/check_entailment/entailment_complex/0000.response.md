Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even, and the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any k consecutive elements in the permutation should be at most 1.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a permutation list of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the permutation list in a specific pattern: for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`, it places the current value `curr_v` at positions that are multiples of `k` plus `i`.
   - This pattern ensures that the values 1 to `k` are distributed evenly across the permutation, repeating every `k` elements.
   - After filling the first `k` elements, the function continues to fill the rest of the permutation with the remaining values in a similar pattern.
   - The final permutation is printed as a space-separated string.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case, effectively generating and printing the required k-level permutation for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The pattern used in `func_1` ensures that the sums of any k consecutive elements in the permutation will be very close to each other, differing by at most 1.
   - This is because the values 1 to `k` are distributed evenly across the permutation, and the sum of any k consecutive elements will include each value from 1 to `k` exactly once or twice, depending on the position.
   - The function correctly handles the constraints and ensures that the permutation is valid (i.e., it contains all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function should work for the minimum values of `n` and `k` (i.e., `n = 2` and `k = 2`).
   - It should also handle the maximum values of `n` and `k` (i.e., `n = 2 * 10^5` and `k = 2 * 10^5`), which it does by ensuring the permutation is constructed in a way that the sums of k consecutive elements are balanced.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly generate a k-level permutation for each test case as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
