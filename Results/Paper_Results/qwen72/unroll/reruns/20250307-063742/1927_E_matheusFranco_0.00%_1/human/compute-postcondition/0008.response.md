Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `permutation` is a list of `n` integers.
- The first `k` values in `permutation` are filled with the sequence 1 to `k` in a pattern that repeats every `k` elements.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is `k` + 1.
- `result` is a string containing the space-separated values of the `permutation` list.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `permutation`**:
   - The list `permutation` has `n` elements.
   - The first `k` elements are filled with the sequence 1 to `k`, and this pattern repeats every `k` elements.
   - For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the `permutation` list would be `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1]`.

2. **Understanding `result`**:
   - `result` is a string that contains the space-separated values of the `permutation` list.
   - Continuing the example, if `permutation` is `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1]`, then `result` would be `"1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1"`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result`.

### Final Output:
The `print(result)` statement will print the string containing the space-separated values of the `permutation` list, where the first `k` elements are filled with the sequence 1 to `k` and this pattern repeats every `k` elements.

Output: **"1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1" (where the string represents the space-separated values of the `permutation` list, and the pattern 1 to `k` repeats every `k` elements)**
