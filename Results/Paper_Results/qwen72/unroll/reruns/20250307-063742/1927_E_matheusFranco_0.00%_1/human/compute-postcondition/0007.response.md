Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where the first `k` values are filled with the sequence 1 to `k` in a pattern that repeats every `k` elements, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `k` + 1, `result` is a string containing the space-separated values of the `permutation` list.**

Explanation: The code snippet converts each integer in the `permutation` list to a string, joins them with spaces, and assigns the resulting string to the variable `result`. The values of `n`, `k`, `permutation`, `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` remain unchanged.
