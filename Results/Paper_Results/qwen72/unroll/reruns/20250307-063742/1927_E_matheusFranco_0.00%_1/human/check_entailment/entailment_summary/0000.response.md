Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of generating a k-level permutation for multiple test cases. Let's break down the components to see if they meet the requirements:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a permutation list of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the permutation list in a specific pattern: for each index `i` from 0 to `k-1`, it fills the positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` with consecutive integers starting from 1.
   - Finally, it prints the permutation as a space-separated string of integers.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then calls `func_1` `t` times, each time reading a new pair of `n` and `k` values.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Permutation Construction**:
  - The function fills the permutation list in a way that ensures the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
  - The pattern used is to place consecutive integers in positions that are multiples of `k` plus a fixed offset `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`).
  - This ensures that the sums of the segments of length `k` are balanced because the integers are distributed evenly across the permutation.

- **Output**:
  - The function prints the permutation as a space-separated string, which is the required output format.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Test Case Handling**:
  - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then calling `func_1` for each test case.
  - This matches the problem's requirement to handle multiple test cases.

### Verification:
- **Constraints**:
  - The constraints are respected: `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even.
  - The function `func_1` ensures that the permutation is of length `n` and contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

- **Correctness of k-level Permutation**:
  - The pattern used in `func_1` ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` are balanced, as the integers are distributed evenly across the permutation.
  - This means that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of these segments will be at most 1, which meets the definition of a k-level permutation.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a k-level permutation for each test case and handles multiple test cases as required. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
