The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should operate with two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function is intended to operate with two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. The specific return value or behavior of the function is not provided.**
