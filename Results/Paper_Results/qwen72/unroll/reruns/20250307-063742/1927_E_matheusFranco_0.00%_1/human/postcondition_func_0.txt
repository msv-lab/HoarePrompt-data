The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. It generates a permutation list of length `n` where the first `k` values are filled with the sequence 1 to `k` in a repeating pattern. The final state of the program is that `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the `permutation` list is printed as a space-separated string of integers. The function does not return any value.
