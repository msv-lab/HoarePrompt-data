Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1.** 

The variables `l` and `r` have been initialized to 0 and `n` - 1, respectively. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
