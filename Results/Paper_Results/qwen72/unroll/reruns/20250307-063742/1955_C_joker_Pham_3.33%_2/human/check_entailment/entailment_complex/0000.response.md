### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and the list `a` of ship durabilities.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the appropriate arguments `n`, `k`, and `a`.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the list `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `k` becomes 0, the loop breaks, as no more attacks can be made.
   - If `l` equals `r`, it means there is only one ship left. The function checks if `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of this ship. If so, the ship is sunk, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the loop breaks without sinking the ship.
   - If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, the function checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`. If so, it reduces `k` by `a[l] * 2`, reduces `a[r]` by `a[l]`, and increments `sunks` by 1. If `a[r]` becomes 0, it is also sunk, and `r` is decremented. The function then moves the left pointer `l` to the next ship.
   - If `k` is exactly `a[l] * 2 - 1`, the function sinks the ship at `l` and breaks the loop.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the loop breaks.
   - If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, the function checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`. If so, it reduces `k` by `a[r] * 2`, reduces `a[l]` by `a[r]`, and increments `sunks` by 1. If `a[l]` becomes 0, it is also sunk, and `l` is incremented. The function then moves the right pointer `r` to the previous ship.
   - If `k` is exactly `a[r] * 2 - 1`, the function sinks the ship at `r` and breaks the loop.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the loop breaks.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the number of ships sunk, which is stored in the variable `sunks`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the case where `k` is 0, breaking the loop and returning the current count of sunk ships.
- The function correctly handles the case where `l` equals `r`, ensuring that the last ship is sunk if `k` is sufficient.
- The function correctly handles the alternating attacks on the first and last ships, reducing their durabilities and updating the pointers and `k` accordingly.
- The function correctly increments the `sunks` counter when a ship is sunk.
- The function ensures that the loop breaks when `k` is not sufficient to sink any more ships or when all ships have been processed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and the main logic of alternating attacks and sinking ships.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
