### Reasoning:

Let's break down the function `func_1` and the provided function summary to evaluate the correctness of the program.

#### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` processes the list `a` from both ends, attempting to reduce the value of `k` by subtracting elements or their doubles, and updating the list `a` and the count `sunks` accordingly. The final state of the program is such that `l` is greater than `r`, `k` is non-negative, and `sunks` reflects the total number of elements removed or consumed.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `l` and `r` are initialized to the start and end indices of the list `a`, respectively.
   - `sunks` is initialized to 0 to count the number of sunk ships.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `k` becomes 0, the loop breaks, as no more attacks can be made.
   - If `l` equals `r`, it means there is only one ship left:
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of this ship, it sinks, and the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, the loop breaks without sinking the ship.
   - If `a[l]` (durability of the first ship) is less than or equal to `a[r]` (durability of the last ship):
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[l]`:
       - The Kraken can sink the first ship and reduce the durability of the last ship by `a[l]`.
       - If the last ship's durability becomes 0, it also sinks.
       - `sunks` is incremented accordingly, and `l` and `r` are adjusted.
     - If `k` is exactly `2 * a[l] - 1`:
       - The Kraken can sink the first ship with the remaining attacks.
       - The loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, the loop breaks.
   - If `a[r]` (durability of the last ship) is less than `a[l]` (durability of the first ship):
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[r]`:
       - The Kraken can sink the last ship and reduce the durability of the first ship by `a[r]`.
       - If the first ship's durability becomes 0, it also sinks.
       - `sunks` is incremented accordingly, and `l` and `r` are adjusted.
     - If `k` is exactly `2 * a[r] - 1`:
       - The Kraken can sink the last ship with the remaining attacks.
       - The loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, the loop breaks.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 0 by breaking the loop immediately.
   - The program handles the case where only one ship is left by checking if `k` is sufficient to sink it.
   - The program correctly adjusts the indices `l` and `r` and the number of attacks `k` after each ship is sunk.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Alternating Attacks:**
   - The program does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks. It only checks if `k` is sufficient to sink both the first and last ship in one go, which is not how the problem specifies the attacks should be handled. The Kraken should attack the first ship, then the last ship, and continue alternating.

2. **Inefficient Reduction of `k`:**
   - The program reduces `k` by `2 * a[l]` or `2 * a[r]` in one step, which is incorrect. Each attack should reduce `k` by 1, and the ship's durability should be reduced by 1 as well.

3. **Incorrect Break Conditions:**
   - The program breaks the loop in several places without ensuring that all possible attacks have been considered. This can lead to premature termination and incorrect results.

### Corrected Approach:
To correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks, we need to alternate between attacking the first and last ship, reducing their durability by 1 each time, and decrementing `k` by 1. We should continue this process until either all ships have sunk or `k` attacks have been made.

### Corrected Code:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, k, a))

def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while k > 0 and l <= r:
        if a[l] == 0:
            l += 1
            continue
        if a[r] == 0:
            r -= 1
            continue
        if l == r:
            if k >= a[l]:
                sunks += 1
            break
        if k >= a[l]:
            k -= a[l]
            a[l] = 0
            sunks += 1
        else:
            a[l] -= k
            k = 0
        if k > 0 and k >= a[r]:
            k -= a[r]
            a[r] = 0
            sunks += 1
        else:
            a[r] -= k
            k = 0
    return sunks
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks and does not handle the alternating nature of the attacks as specified in the problem description. The corrected code addresses these issues and should produce the correct results.

Final: **False**
