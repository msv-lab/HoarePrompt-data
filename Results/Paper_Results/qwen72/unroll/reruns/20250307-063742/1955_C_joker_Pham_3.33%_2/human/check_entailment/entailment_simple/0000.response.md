### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ship durabilities `a`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the list `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.
   - The function enters a while loop that continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

3. **Handling Attacks:**
   - **Case 1: `l == r` (only one ship left):**
     - If the remaining attacks `k` are greater than or equal to the durability of the last ship `a[r]`, the ship sinks, and the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, the loop breaks without sinking the ship.
   - **Case 2: `a[l] <= a[r]` (first ship has less or equal durability than the last ship):**
     - If the remaining attacks `k` are greater than or equal to twice the durability of the first ship `a[l]`, the first ship is fully attacked, and its durability is subtracted from the last ship `a[r]`.
     - If the last ship's durability becomes zero, it sinks, and the right pointer `r` is decremented.
     - The first ship is always sunk, and the left pointer `l` is incremented.
     - If the remaining attacks `k` are exactly one less than twice the durability of the first ship, the first ship is sunk, and the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, the loop breaks.
   - **Case 3: `a[r] < a[l]` (last ship has less durability than the first ship):**
     - If the remaining attacks `k` are greater than or equal to twice the durability of the last ship `a[r]`, the last ship is fully attacked, and its durability is subtracted from the first ship `a[l]`.
     - If the first ship's durability becomes zero, it sinks, and the left pointer `l` is incremented.
     - The last ship is always sunk, and the right pointer `r` is decremented.
     - If the remaining attacks `k` are exactly one less than twice the durability of the last ship, the last ship is sunk, and the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, the loop breaks.

4. **Final State:**
   - The loop terminates when `l` is greater than `r`, meaning all remaining ships have been processed.
   - The function returns the number of ships sunk, stored in `sunks`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the different scenarios of attacks and ship sinking.
- The logic for decrementing the durability of ships and updating the pointers is sound.
- The program ensures that the Kraken attacks the first and last ships in the described alternating pattern.
- The edge cases, such as when only one ship is left, are handled appropriately.
- The program correctly breaks out of the loop when the number of remaining attacks `k` is not sufficient to sink any more ships.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be logically correct and should handle the given problem description and constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
