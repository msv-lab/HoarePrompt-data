You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer indicating the length of the list `a`), `k` (a positive integer representing a threshold), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers). The function returns an integer `sunks`, which represents the number of elements that have been either fully removed or partially consumed from the list `a` based on the value of `k`. The function processes the list `a` from both ends, attempting to reduce the value of `k` by subtracting elements or their doubles, and updating the list `a` and the count `sunks` accordingly. The final state of the program is such that `l` is greater than `r`, `k` is non-negative, and `sunks` reflects the total number of elements removed or consumed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the Kraken attacks the ships in the specified alternating pattern (first, last, first, last, etc.). Specifically, the logic for decrementing the durability of the ships and updating the attack count is flawed. Here’s a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 5
1 2 4 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

The program incorrectly counts the number of ships sunk. According to the problem description, the Kraken should attack the first ship, then the last ship, and so on, until it has attacked `k` times or all ships have sunk. The provided code does not correctly simulate this process, leading to an incorrect result.
