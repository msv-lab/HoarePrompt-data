Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer indicating the length of the list `a`), `k` (a positive integer representing a threshold), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers). The function returns an integer `sunks`, which represents the number of elements that have been either fully removed or partially consumed from the list `a` based on the value of `k`. The function processes the list `a` from both ends, attempting to reduce the value of `k` by subtracting elements or their doubles, and updating the list `a` and the count `sunks` accordingly. The final state of the program is such that `l` is greater than `r`, `k` is non-negative, and `sunks` reflects the total number of elements removed or consumed. **
