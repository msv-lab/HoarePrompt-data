The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. `k` is a positive integer representing a threshold value, where 1 <= k <= 10^15. `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, each element `a_i` satisfying 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The function returns the number of elements removed from the list `a` or the number of times an element was fully or partially consumed, represented by the variable `sunks`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. It returns the number of elements removed from the list `a` or the number of times an element was fully or partially consumed, based on the threshold `k`.**
