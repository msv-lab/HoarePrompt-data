Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Attacks**: The program attempts to handle the attacks in a way that is not consistent with the problem's requirements. It tries to reduce the durability of both the first and last ships in a single iteration, which is not how the Kraken attacks according to the problem statement. The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ships, one at a time.

2. **Complexity and Redundancy**: The logic within the `while` loop is overly complex and redundant. It includes multiple checks and conditions that are not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when the number of attacks is very large or when the ships have different durabilities.

To correct the program, we need to ensure that the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ships, and we need to properly handle the reduction of their durabilities and the counting of sunk ships. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while k > 0 and l <= r:
        if l == r:
            if k >= a[l]:
                sunks += 1
            break
        if k >= a[l]:
            k -= a[l]
            l += 1
            sunks += 1
        else:
            a[l] -= k
            break
        if k >= a[r]:
            k -= a[r]
            r -= 1
            sunks += 1
        else:
            a[r] -= k
            break
    return sunks

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, k, a))
```

This corrected version ensures that the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ships, and it properly handles the reduction of their durabilities and the counting of sunk ships. It also handles the edge case where the number of attacks is very large or when the ships have different durabilities.
