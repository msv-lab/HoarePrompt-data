Output State: **The `numbers` list contains all the pairs of integers representing the edges in the tree, and the loop has stopped after reading the last line which contains a single integer.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to read lines from the input until it encounters a line that does not contain exactly two integers.
- Each line that contains exactly two integers is split into `num1` and `num2`, and these integers are appended to the `numbers` list as a pair.
- The loop stops when it reads the last line, which contains a single integer (the starting node for the round), and this line is not processed by the loop.
- Therefore, after the loop finishes, the `numbers` list will contain all the pairs of integers that represent the edges in the tree, and the initial state of the other variables (like the starting node) remains unchanged.
