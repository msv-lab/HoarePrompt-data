Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters but reads input from stdin. The input consists of the first line containing two integers `n` and `t`, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5` and `t = 1`, representing the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively. The next `n-1` lines contain pairs of integers `u` and `v`, where `1 ≤ u, v ≤ n`, each representing an edge in the tree. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer `u_1`, where `1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n`, indicating the starting node for the round. The function returns a list `numbers` which contains all the pairs of integers representing the edges in the tree.**
