Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input from stdin until a line with a different format is encountered. It expects the input to start with `n-1` lines, each containing a pair of integers representing edges in a tree, followed by a line with a single integer. The function returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains a pair of integers representing the edges in the tree. The input line with a single integer is not included in the returned list. **
