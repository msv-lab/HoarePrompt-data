Precondition: **The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but it is expected to read input from stdin. The input consists of: the first line containing two integers n and t, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t = 1, representing the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively. The next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers u and v, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, each representing an edge in the tree. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, indicating the starting node for the round.**
