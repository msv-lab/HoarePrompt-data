You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but it is expected to read input from stdin. The input consists of: the first line containing two integers n and t, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t = 1, representing the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively. The next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers u and v, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, each representing an edge in the tree. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, indicating the starting node for the round.
def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: The `numbers` list contains all the pairs of integers representing the edges in the tree, and the loop has stopped after reading the last line which contains a single integer.
    return numbers
    #The program returns the list `numbers` which contains all the pairs of integers representing the edges in the tree.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters but reads input from stdin. The input consists of the first line containing two integers `n` and `t`, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5` and `t = 1`, representing the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively. The next `n-1` lines contain pairs of integers `u` and `v`, where `1 ≤ u, v ≤ n`, each representing an edge in the tree. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer `u_1`, where `1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n`, indicating the starting node for the round. The function returns a list `numbers` which contains all the pairs of integers representing the edges in the tree.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `numbers` which contains all the pairs of integers representing the edges in the tree.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
