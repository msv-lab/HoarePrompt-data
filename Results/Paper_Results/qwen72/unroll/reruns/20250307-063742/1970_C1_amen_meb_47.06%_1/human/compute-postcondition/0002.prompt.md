Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but it is expected to read input from stdin. The input consists of: the first line containing two integers n and t, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t = 1, representing the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively. The next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers u and v, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, each representing an edge in the tree. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, indicating the starting node for the round. `numbers` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    nums = input().split()
    if len(nums) != 2:
        break
    num1 = int(nums[0])
    num2 = int(nums[1])
    numbers.append([num1, num2])



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
