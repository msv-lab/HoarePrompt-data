The function `accept_numbers` does not take any input parameters. However, based on the problem description, it is expected that the function will read input values that include an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, and an integer t (t=1) representing the number of rounds. The function will also read n-1 lines of integers (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the edges of the tree, and one line with an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the round.
