The function `func` is described with specific parameter constraints and relationships. It accepts no direct parameters in its definition but is expected to handle multiple test cases internally. Each test case involves an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of books, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of pages in each book. The function's output is not explicitly provided in the problem statement, but based on common programming practices, it is likely that the function returns some form of result for each test case, possibly related to the number of pages in the books.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases, each with a number of books and the number of pages in each book. It returns a result for each test case, although the specific nature of the result is not defined in the given information.**
