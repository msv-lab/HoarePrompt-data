The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs an array `ans` of length `n` where the elements are powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of 1s in the binary representation of `k`. If the number of 1s in `k` is less than `n`, the remaining elements in `ans` are set to 0. The function prints the array `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
