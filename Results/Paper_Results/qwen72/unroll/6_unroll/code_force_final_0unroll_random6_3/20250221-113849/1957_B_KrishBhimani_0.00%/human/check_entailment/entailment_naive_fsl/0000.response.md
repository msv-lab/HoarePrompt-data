Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \( n > k \). According to the problem description, the sequence must contain exactly \( n \) non-negative integers that sum up to \( k \). If \( n > k \), it is impossible to construct such a sequence because the sum of \( n \) non-negative integers cannot be less than \( n \) (since each integer is at least 0). However, the program does not check for this condition and may produce an incorrect sequence.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 2
```
Here, \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 2 \). The program will output:
```
2 0 0
```
This sequence does not satisfy the condition that the sum of the integers should be \( k \) (i.e., 2), because the sum is 2, but the sequence should contain 3 integers. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
