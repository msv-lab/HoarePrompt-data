The function `func` reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99). It calculates the number of screens required based on the space needed for `x` and `y` and appends the result to a list `result`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of `result` on a new line, where each element represents the total number of screens required for the corresponding test case. The function does not return any value, but the state of the program after the function concludes includes a printed list of screen requirements for each test case, and the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged.
