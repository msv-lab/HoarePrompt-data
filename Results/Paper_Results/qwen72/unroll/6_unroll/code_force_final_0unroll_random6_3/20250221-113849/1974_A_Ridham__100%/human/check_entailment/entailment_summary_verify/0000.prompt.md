You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if extra_space % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99). It calculates the number of screens required based on the space needed for `x` and `y` and appends the result to a list `result`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of `result` on a new line, where each element represents the total number of screens required for the corresponding test case. The function does not return any value, but the state of the program after the function concludes includes a printed list of screen requirements for each test case, and the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 1x1 icons (x) is sufficient to fill the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons, but the placement of 1x1 icons is not optimal. For example, consider the test case where `x = 8` and `y = 2`. According to the problem, the minimum number of screens required should be 2, but the program calculates it as 3. This is because the program does not consider the possibility of placing 1x1 icons in the remaining spaces after placing 2x2 icons in a way that minimizes the number of screens. 

To illustrate, the optimal placement for `x = 8` and `y = 2` can be:
- Screen 1: 2x2 icon, 7 1x1 icons
- Screen 2: 2x2 icon, 1 1x1 icon

However, the program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons first, which is 2 screens, and then checks if the remaining space can accommodate the 1x1 icons. In this case, it incorrectly calculates that an additional screen is needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
