### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`).
   - The function calculates the total space required for the 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
   - The total space required is then `total_space = space_y + space_x`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The function determines the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. If `y` is even, it divides `y` by 2 to get the number of screens. If `y` is odd, it divides `y` by 2 and adds 1 to account for the extra screen needed.
   - This calculation is correct because a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a screen has 15 cells (5x3). Therefore, two 2x2 icons can fit on one screen, and if there is an odd number of 2x2 icons, one extra screen is needed.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the remaining cells on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons (`remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`).
   - This calculation is correct because it determines how many cells are left after placing all 2x2 icons.

5. **Space Calculation for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The function checks if the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`if space_x <= remaining_cells`).
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient, it appends the number of screens required for 2x2 icons to the result list.
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, it calculates the extra screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` and `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`).

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the results for each test case on a new line, which is the correct format as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, calculates the required number of screens for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons, and prints the results in the correct format. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
