You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))

    #State: `result` is a list containing the number of screens required for each test case based on the given conditions. The length of `result` is equal to `n`, and each element in `result` represents the total number of screens required for the corresponding test case. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: [result[0]]
    #[result[1]]
    #...
    #[result[n-1]] (where each [result[i]] is the number of screens required for the corresponding test case)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99). It calculates the number of screens required based on the space needed for `x` and `y` and appends the result to a list `result`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of `result` on a new line, where each element represents the total number of screens required for the corresponding test case. The function does not return any value, but the state of the program after the function concludes includes a printed list of screen requirements for each test case, and the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`).
   - It also calculates the total space required for the 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
   - The total space required is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program determines the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the program calculates:
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` if `y` is even.
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
   - This is correct because each screen can hold at most 2 of the 2x2 icons (since 2 * 4 = 8 cells, and 15 cells are available per screen).

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - This is correct because it subtracts the space occupied by the 2x2 icons from the total available cells on the screens required for the 2x2 icons.

5. **Handling 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all the 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), the program appends the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons to the result.
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` calculates the space still needed for the 1x1 icons.
     - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15` calculates the number of full screens needed for the extra space.
     - If there is any remaining space after the full screens (`extra_space % 15 != 0`), it adds one more screen to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.

6. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case, each on a new line.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic to determine the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons. It handles both the 2x2 and 1x1 icons efficiently and correctly according to the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
