Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for placing the icons. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program assumes that each 2x2 icon requires at least half a screen, which is not always true. A single screen can fit up to 3 such icons without any 1x1 icons, or a combination of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

2. **Incorrect Calculation for Remaining Cells**:
   - The program calculates the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons and then tries to fit 1x1 icons into these remaining cells. However, it does not consider the optimal placement of 1x1 icons alongside 2x2 icons on the same screen.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the number of 2x2 icons is zero or where the number of 1x1 icons is zero correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the minimum number of screens, you should consider the following steps:
1. Calculate the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit on a single screen (which is 3).
2. Place as many 2x2 icons as possible on the screens.
3. Calculate the remaining space on these screens and try to fit as many 1x1 icons as possible.
4. If there are still 1x1 icons left, calculate the additional screens required for them.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        screens = 0
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        while y > 0:
            if y >= 3:
                screens += 1
                y -= 3
                x -= (15 - 3 * 4)  # Remaining cells after placing 3 2x2 icons
            else:
                screens += 1
                x -= (15 - y * 4)  # Remaining cells after placing y 2x2 icons
                y = 0
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons
        if x > 0:
            screens += (x + 14) // 15  # Ceiling division to account for partial screens
        
        result.append(screens)
    
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected program should handle all edge cases and provide the correct minimum number of screens for each test case.
