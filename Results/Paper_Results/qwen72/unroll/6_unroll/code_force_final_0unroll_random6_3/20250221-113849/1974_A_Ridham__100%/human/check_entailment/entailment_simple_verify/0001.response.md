### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - This part of the program is accurate and matches the problem description.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`).
   - It also calculates the total space required for the 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
   - The total space required is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`.
   - This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program determines the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the program calculates:
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` if `y` is even.
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
   - This is correct because each screen can hold at most 2 of the 2x2 icons (since 2 * 4 = 8 cells, and 15 cells are available per screen).
   - The calculation ensures that all 2x2 icons are placed on the minimum number of screens.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - This is correct because it subtracts the space occupied by the 2x2 icons from the total available cells on the screens required for the 2x2 icons.
   - The remaining cells are used to determine if the 1x1 icons can fit on these screens.

5. **Handling 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all the 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), the program appends the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons to the result.
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` calculates the space still needed for the 1x1 icons.
     - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15` calculates the number of full screens needed for the extra space.
     - If there is any remaining space after the full screens (`extra_space % 15 != 0`), it adds one more screen to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - This logic is correct and ensures that all 1x1 icons are placed on the minimum number of additional screens.

6. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case, each on a new line.
   - The output format matches the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
The program follows the correct logic to determine the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons. It handles both the 2x2 and 1x1 icons efficiently and correctly according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
