The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the length of the array after removing the longest prefix and suffix of equal elements. If the array is entirely composed of equal elements, it prints 0. If the array has no equal elements in the prefix or suffix, it prints the length of the array minus 1. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` retain their initial values for the next test case, and the loop variables `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` are reset for each test case.
