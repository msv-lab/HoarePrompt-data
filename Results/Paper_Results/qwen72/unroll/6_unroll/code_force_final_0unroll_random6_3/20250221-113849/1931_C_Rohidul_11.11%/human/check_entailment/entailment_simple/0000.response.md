### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to make all elements of the array equal with the minimum cost.
   - The cost of an operation is the number of elements being assigned a new value, which is `(j - i + 1)` burles.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then moves the `l` pointer to the right as long as the current element is equal to the next element.
   - Similarly, it moves the `r` pointer to the left as long as the current element is equal to the previous element.
   - The `st` and `end` variables keep track of the number of elements in the prefix and suffix that are equal.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are equal, the program calculates the cost as the length of the array minus the length of the prefix and suffix that are equal.
   - If the first and last elements are not equal and there are no equal elements in the prefix or suffix, the program calculates the cost as the length of the array minus one.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the cost as the length of the array minus the length of the prefix and suffix that are equal.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: The program correctly handles this case by outputting `0` because no operation is needed.
   - **All Elements Equal**: The program correctly handles this case by outputting `0` because no operation is needed.
   - **Different First and Last Elements**: The program correctly handles this case by ensuring the minimum cost is calculated based on the longest prefix and suffix of equal elements.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the longest prefix and suffix of equal elements.
   - It correctly calculates the minimum cost based on the conditions provided.
   - The logic for handling different cases (all elements equal, different first and last elements, etc.) is sound and matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly solves the problem by finding the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal, considering the constraints and edge cases.
