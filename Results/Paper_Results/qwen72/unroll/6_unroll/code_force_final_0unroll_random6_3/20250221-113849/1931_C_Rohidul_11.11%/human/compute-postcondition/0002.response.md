The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of an array, and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the array elements. The function should process these test cases and return the appropriate output for each one. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it returns a result based on the array `a`.**
