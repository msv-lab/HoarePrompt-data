Output State: **The function should be called within a loop that iterates over a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct). `n` is now an integer provided by the user.**
