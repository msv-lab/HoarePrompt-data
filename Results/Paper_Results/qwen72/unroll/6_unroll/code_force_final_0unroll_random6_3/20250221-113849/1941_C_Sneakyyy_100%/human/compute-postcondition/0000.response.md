The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the `range` function that takes an integer input. The loop will execute based on the value of this input. The state of `t`, `n`, and `s` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute, the input to the `range` function must be a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6
- `s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6

The input to the `range` function is `int(input())`, which means the loop will execute `int(input())` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
