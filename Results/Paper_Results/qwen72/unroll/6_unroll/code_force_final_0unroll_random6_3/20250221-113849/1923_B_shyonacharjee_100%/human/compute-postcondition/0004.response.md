Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by two lists `a` and `x` of length `n` from the input. It then determines whether a player can survive an attack from `n` monsters, each with a position `x_i` and health `a_i`. The player can survive if the total number of bullets used to defeat all monsters (where each monster requires `a_i` bullets) does not exceed the maximum distance `k` multiplied by the absolute position of the monster. The function prints 'YES' if the player can survive the attack for the current test case, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. **
