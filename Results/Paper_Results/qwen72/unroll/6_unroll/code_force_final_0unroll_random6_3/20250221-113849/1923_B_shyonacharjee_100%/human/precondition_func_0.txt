t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, and test_cases is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple containing three lists: the first list has two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9), the second list has n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and the third list has n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (-n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n, x_i ≠ 0). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
