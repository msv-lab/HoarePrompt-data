The value of `t` is updated to the integer input provided by the user. The variable `test_cases` remains unchanged and still holds a list of `t` elements, where each element is a tuple containing three lists as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided by the user, `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, where each element is a tuple containing three lists: the first list has two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9), the second list has `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and the third list has `n` integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` (-n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n, x_i ≠ 0). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
