The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that it accepts a parameter `t` and a parameter `test_cases`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, where each element is a tuple containing three lists:
  - The first list contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9).
  - The second list contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
  - The third list contains `n` integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` (-n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n, x_i ≠ 0).
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns a result based on the input test cases, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. However, based on the typical structure of such functions, it is likely that the function processes each test case and returns a list of results corresponding to each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list `test_cases` of `t` elements, where each element is a tuple containing three lists: the first list with two integers `n` and `k`, the second list with `n` integers, and the third list with `n` integers. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results corresponding to each test case.**
