Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input provided by the user, `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, where each element is a tuple containing three lists: the first list has two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9), the second list has `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and the third list has `n` integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` (-n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n, x_i ≠ 0). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
    bullets_used = 0
    can_survive = True
    for pos, health in monsters:
        distance = abs(pos)
        total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
        if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
            can_survive = False
            break
        bullets_used += health
    print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
