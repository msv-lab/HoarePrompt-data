Precondition: **The function `func_1` is expected to be called with an integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) as input, and the function should handle up to 1000 test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).** 

However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should be:

```
def func_1(t, X):
```

With the precondition:

**t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and X is a list of integers where each integer X[i] satisfies (2 ≤ X[i] ≤ 10^18).**
