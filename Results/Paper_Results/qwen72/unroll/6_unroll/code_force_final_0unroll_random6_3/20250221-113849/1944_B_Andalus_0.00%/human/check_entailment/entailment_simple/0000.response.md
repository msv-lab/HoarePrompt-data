### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def find_subarrays(a, n, k):` where `a` is a list of integers of length `2n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\).
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `k`, and the list `lst`.

2. **Splitting the List:**
   - The list `lst` is split into two halves: `lft` and `rgt`. This is correct as per the problem statement, which requires `l` to be a subset of the first half and `r` to be a subset of the second half.

3. **Sorting the Halves:**
   - Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted. Sorting is a good approach to easily identify pairs of the same elements.

4. **Identifying Pairs and Single Elements:**
   - The program uses a loop to identify pairs of the same elements in `lft` and adds them to `ldb`. It also identifies single elements (i.e., elements that do not have a pair in the current iteration) and adds them to `sng`.
   - Similarly, it identifies pairs of the same elements in `rgt` and adds them to `rdb`.

5. **Constructing the Output:**
   - The program then prints elements from `ldb` and `sng` to form the array `l` of length `2k`.
   - It does the same for `rdb` and `sng` to form the array `r` of length `2k`.

6. **Issues:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where `k` is greater than the number of pairs found in `ldb` and `rdb`. It may not be able to form arrays `l` and `r` of length `2k` if there are not enough pairs.
   - The program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`. It only prints pairs and single elements without checking the XOR condition.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure the bitwise XOR condition and may not always form arrays `l` and `r` of the required length `2k`.

**Correctness: False**
