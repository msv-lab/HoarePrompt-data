The function reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of integers `lst` of length `2n`. It then processes the list to find and print pairs of integers from the left and right halves of the sorted list, ensuring that the total number of printed integers is `k` for each half. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After each test case, the variables `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `sz` are reset for the next iteration. The final state of these variables is undefined as they are reinitialized in each iteration. The only variable that remains unchanged is `T`, which is the total number of test cases.
