The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the input `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function at the start of the loop.

State: **`func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `t` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0**
