The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraints 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers between 1 and 26 (inclusive). The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the exact return value is not specified.**
