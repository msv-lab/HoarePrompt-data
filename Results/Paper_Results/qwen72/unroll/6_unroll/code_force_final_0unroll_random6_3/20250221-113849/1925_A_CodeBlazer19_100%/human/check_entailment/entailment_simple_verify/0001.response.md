Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`. The goal is to find the shortest possible string `s` that satisfies this condition.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `k`.

3. **String Construction**:
   - The program constructs the string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - For example, if `k = 3` and `n = 2`, the program will generate the string `'abcbac'`.

4. **Subsequence Verification**:
   - The constructed string `s` is of the form `('a' to 'k') * n`.
   - This means that `s` will contain each of the first `k` characters repeated `n` times.
   - However, this construction does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters are subsequences of `s`. For instance, consider `n = 2` and `k = 2`. The string `'abab'` generated by the program does not contain the subsequence `'ba'`, which is a valid string of length 2 using the first 2 characters.

5. **Shortest String**:
   - The length of the constructed string `s` is `k * n`.
   - While this length is a valid length, it is not necessarily the shortest possible length that can contain all required subsequences. The shortest string should be constructed in a way that minimizes the number of repeated characters while ensuring all subsequences are present.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 1`, the string `s` will be the first `k` characters repeated once, which is the correct and shortest possible string.
   - For `k = 1`, the string `s` will be the same character repeated `n` times, which is the correct and shortest possible string.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the string `s` will be `'abab'`, which does not contain the subsequence `'ba'`, making it incorrect.

7. **General Case**:
   - For any `n` and `k`, the string `s` will be of the form `('a' to 'k') * n`, which does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters are subsequences of `s`.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases, particularly when `n > 1` and `k > 1`.

Final: **False**
