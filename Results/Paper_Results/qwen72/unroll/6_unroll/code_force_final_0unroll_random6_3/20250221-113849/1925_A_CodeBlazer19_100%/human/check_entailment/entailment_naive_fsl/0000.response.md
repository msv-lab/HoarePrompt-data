Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not always produce the smallest possible string that contains all possible substrings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 2`. The program will output `aabb`, but the correct output should be `baab`, which is a smaller string that still contains all possible substrings of length 2 using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets (`aa`, `ab`, `ba`, `bb`). The program simply repeats the first `k` alphabets `n` times, which does not guarantee the smallest possible string.
