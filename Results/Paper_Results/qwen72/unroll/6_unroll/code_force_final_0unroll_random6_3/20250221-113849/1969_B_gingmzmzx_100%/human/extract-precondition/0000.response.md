Precondition: **The function should take a single argument, a list of binary strings, where each string s has a length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5 and consists only of '0's and '1's. The sum of the lengths of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should accept a list of binary strings to handle multiple test cases as described in the problem. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
```

Precondition: **test_cases is a list of binary strings, where each string s has a length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5 and consists only of '0's and '1's. The sum of the lengths of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
