### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost.
   - A cyclic shift operation on a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) costs \( r - l + 1 \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string \( s \).
   - It converts the string into a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeroes in the string.
   - It initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the minimum total cost.
   - It iterates through each character in the string:
     - If the character is 0, it increments the count of 0s in `cnt` and adds 1 to `ans` if there are any 1s before it.
     - If the character is 1, it increments the count of 1s in `cnt` and adds the number of remaining 0s to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the total cost `ans` for each test case.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly counts the number of 0s and 1s in the string.
   - The cost calculation is based on the idea that each 0 that appears after a 1 in the string needs to be moved to the front, and each 1 that appears before a 0 needs to be moved to the end.
   - The cost for moving a 0 to the front is 1 (since it can be done by a single cyclic shift of a substring of length 1).
   - The cost for moving a 1 to the end is the number of remaining 0s (since each 1 needs to be moved past all remaining 0s).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The algorithm handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by correctly outputting 0.
   - It also handles the case where the string is not sorted (e.g., "101011") by correctly calculating the minimum cost.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity is \( O(n) \) for each test case, where \( n \) is the length of the string.
   - The space complexity is \( O(n) \) due to the list conversion of the string.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the algorithm to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
