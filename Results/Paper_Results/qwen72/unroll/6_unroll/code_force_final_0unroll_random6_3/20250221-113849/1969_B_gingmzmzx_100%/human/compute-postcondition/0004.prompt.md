You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, a list of binary strings, where each string s has a length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5 and consists only of '0's and '1's. The sum of the lengths of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `n` times, and for each iteration, it will read a binary string `s` from the input, convert it into a list of integers, and then compute and print the value of `ans` based on the number of '0's and '1's in the string. After all iterations, the loop will have printed `n` lines, each containing the computed value of `ans` for the corresponding binary string. The variables `s`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` will be reset for each iteration, so their final values will be the ones from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of binary strings, where each string has a length between 2 and 200,000 characters and consists only of '0's and '1's, and the sum of the lengths of all strings in the list does not exceed 200,000. The function returns a result based on the input list of binary strings.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
