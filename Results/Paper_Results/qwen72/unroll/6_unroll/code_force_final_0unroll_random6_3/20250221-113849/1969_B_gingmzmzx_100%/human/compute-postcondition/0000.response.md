The value of `n` is assigned the integer value obtained from the input. The other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: The function should take a single argument, a list of binary strings, where each string s has a length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5 and consists only of '0's and '1's. The sum of the lengths of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` is an input integer.
