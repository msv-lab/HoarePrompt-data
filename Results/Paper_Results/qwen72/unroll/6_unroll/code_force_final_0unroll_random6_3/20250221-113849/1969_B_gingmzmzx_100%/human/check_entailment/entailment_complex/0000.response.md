### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers (0s and 1s).

2. **Counting Zeroes:**
   - The variable `zeroes` is used to count the number of 0s in the string `s`.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The variable `cnt` is a list with two elements, `cnt[0]` and `cnt[1]`, which keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s encountered so far in the string.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0 and is used to accumulate the total cost of sorting the string.
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is 0, it checks if there are any 1s encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`). If there are, it adds 1 to `ans` because a cyclic shift is needed to move the 0 to the left of the 1s.
     - If `c` is 1, it adds the number of 0s that have not been encountered yet (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans` because each 1 needs to be moved to the right of all 0s.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the computed value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The algorithm correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order.
  - The cost is calculated by considering the number of 0s and 1s and the positions where they need to be moved to achieve the sorted order.
  - The logic of adding 1 to `ans` when a 0 is encountered after a 1, and adding the remaining 0s to `ans` when a 1 is encountered, ensures that the minimum number of cyclic shifts is counted.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by not adding any extra cost.
  - The function also handles the case where the string has only 1s or only 0s by correctly computing the cost as 0.

- **Input Constraints:**
  - The function adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description, including the number of test cases and the length of the binary strings.
