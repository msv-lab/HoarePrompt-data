The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, indicating the number of binary strings to process. For each of the `n` iterations, it reads a binary string `s` from the input, converts it into a list of integers, and computes a value `ans` based on the number of '0's and '1's in the string. The function then prints the computed value of `ans` for each binary string. After processing all `n` binary strings, the function will have printed `n` lines, each containing the computed value of `ans` for the corresponding binary string. The function does not return any value.
