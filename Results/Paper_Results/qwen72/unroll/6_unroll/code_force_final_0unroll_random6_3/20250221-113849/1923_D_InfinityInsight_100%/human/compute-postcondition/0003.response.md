The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is 1.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and must be greater than 1, `left` is a list containing the integer 0, `last` is a list containing the integer -1, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1, `i` is 1**
