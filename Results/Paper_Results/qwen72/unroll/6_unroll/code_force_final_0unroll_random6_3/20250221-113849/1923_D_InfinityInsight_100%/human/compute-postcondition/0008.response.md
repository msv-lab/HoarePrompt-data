The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. For the loop to execute, `i` should be set to 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`a` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 1, `left` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the current index, `last` remains a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the value `a[i]` before a different value appears, `ans` remains a list of length `n` where each element is -1, `i` is 1**
