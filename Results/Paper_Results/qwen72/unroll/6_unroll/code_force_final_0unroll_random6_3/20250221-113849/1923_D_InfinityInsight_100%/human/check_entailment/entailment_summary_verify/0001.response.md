### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, or report -1 if it is impossible.
   - Slimes can only eat their neighbors if they are strictly larger.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function takes a list `a` and an integer `x`.
     - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.
     - The function adjusts the index by 1 to account for 0-based indexing and returns it.
     - This function is used to find the position of a cumulative sum in the `left` list.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function takes a list `a` and an integer `n`.
     - It initializes `left` to keep track of cumulative sums of slime sizes.
     - It initializes `last` to keep track of the last index of a different size slime before the current slime.
     - It initializes `ans` with -1 for each slime, indicating that initially, all slimes are assumed to be impossible to be eaten.
     - It iterates through the slimes to update the `last` list.
     - It then iterates through the slimes again to calculate the minimum time each slime can be eaten:
       - If the current slime `a[i]` is smaller than the previous slime `a[i-1]`, it sets `ans[i]` to 1 because the previous slime can eat it immediately.
       - Otherwise, it calculates `x` as the cumulative sum of sizes up to the current slime minus the size of the current slime minus 1.
       - It uses `func_1` to find the index `inx` of the first cumulative sum in `left` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
       - It also uses `last` to find the index `inx2` of the last slime with a different size before the current slime.
       - If `inx2` is less than `inx`, it updates `inx` to `inx2`.
       - If `inx` is valid (not -1), it updates `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Immediate Eating**:
     - The program correctly handles the case where a slime is immediately eaten by a larger neighbor by setting `ans[i]` to 1.
   - **Cumulative Sum and Binary Search**:
     - The use of cumulative sums and binary search (`func_1`) helps in efficiently finding the minimum time a slime can be eaten.
     - The cumulative sum `left` is correctly updated to include the sizes of all slimes up to the current one.
   - **Last Different Size**:
     - The `last` list ensures that the program considers the last slime with a different size, which is crucial for the correct calculation of the minimum time.
     - This helps in cases where a slime can be eaten by a larger slime that is not immediately adjacent but has a different size.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The program correctly handles the edge cases where it is impossible for a slime to be eaten by setting `ans[i]` to -1.
     - The program also handles the case where the cumulative sum is not found by returning -1 from `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given problem description and constraints. The use of cumulative sums and binary search, along with the `last` list, ensures that the program efficiently and accurately calculates the minimum time each slime can be eaten. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
