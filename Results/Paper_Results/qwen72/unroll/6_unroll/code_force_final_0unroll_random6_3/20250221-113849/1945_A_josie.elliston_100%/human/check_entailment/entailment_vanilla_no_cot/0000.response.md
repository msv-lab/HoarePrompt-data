Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to form complete tents.
   - If it's not possible to form complete tents, it returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function combines the results from `func_1` with the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` to get the total number of tents needed.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases described in the problem. For example:
- In the first test case (1 introvert, 2 extroverts, 3 universals), the program correctly calculates that 1 tent is needed for the introvert, and 2 tents are needed for the extroverts and universals, totaling 3 tents.
- In the second test case (1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal), the program correctly identifies that it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and returns -1.

Thus, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
