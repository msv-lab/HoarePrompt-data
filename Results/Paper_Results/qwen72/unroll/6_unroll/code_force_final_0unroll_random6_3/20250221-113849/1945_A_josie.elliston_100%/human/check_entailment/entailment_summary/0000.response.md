Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate introverts, extroverts, and universals according to their preferences. The key points are:
- Each introvert must have a tent alone.
- Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
- Universals can be in a tent with any number of people (1, 2, or 3).

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(extroverts, universals)`: This function calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the extroverts and universals. It checks if the extroverts can be fully accommodated in tents of 3 people each, and if not, it checks if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to form complete tents. If it's impossible, it returns `None`.
2. `func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)`: This function combines the results of `func_1` with the number of introverts. It adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1` (if it's not `None`), otherwise, it returns -1.

Let's break down the logic:
- `func_1` correctly handles the case where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3. If the remainder of `extroverts % 3` plus the number of universals is less than 3, it returns `None` because it's impossible to form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts.
- `func_1` returns the ceiling of `(extroverts + universals) / 3` to ensure that all extroverts and universals are accommodated in the minimum number of tents.
- `func_2` correctly adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1` if `func_1` returns a valid number of tents. If `func_1` returns `None`, `func_2` returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate all participants.

The provided test cases and their expected outputs are consistent with the logic of the program:
- For the test case `1 2 3`, the program correctly outputs `3` because 1 introvert needs 1 tent, and the remaining 2 extroverts and 3 universals can be accommodated in 2 more tents.
- For the test case `1 4 1`, the program correctly outputs `-1` because 4 extroverts require 2 complete tents, but the remaining 1 extrovert cannot be paired with the 1 universal to form a complete tent.
- For the test case `1 4 2`, the program correctly outputs `3` because 1 introvert needs 1 tent, and the remaining 4 extroverts and 2 universals can be accommodated in 2 more tents.
- For the test case `1 1 1`, the program correctly outputs `-1` because 1 extrovert cannot be paired with the 1 universal to form a complete tent.
- For the test case `1 3 2`, the program correctly outputs `3` because 1 introvert needs 1 tent, and the remaining 3 extroverts and 2 universals can be accommodated in 2 more tents.
- For the test case `19 7 18`, the program correctly outputs `28` because 19 introverts need 19 tents, and the remaining 7 extroverts and 18 universals can be accommodated in 9 more tents.
- For the test case `0 0 0`, the program correctly outputs `0` because there are no participants.
- For the test case `7 0 0`, the program correctly outputs `7` because 7 introverts need 7 tents.
- For the test case `0 24 0`, the program correctly outputs `8` because 24 extroverts can be accommodated in 8 tents.
- For the test case `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`, the program correctly outputs `1666666667` because 1000000000 introverts need 1000000000 tents, and the remaining 1000000000 extroverts and 1000000000 universals can be accommodated in 666666667 more tents.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
