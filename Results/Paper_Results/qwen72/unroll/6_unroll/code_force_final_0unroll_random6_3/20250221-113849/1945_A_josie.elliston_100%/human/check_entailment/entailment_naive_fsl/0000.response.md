Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly account for the constraints that each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

In this case, there is 1 introvert, 1 extrovert, and 1 universal. The introvert must be in a tent alone, which uses up 1 tent. The extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two other people, but there is only one universal left, which is not enough to satisfy the extrovert's requirement. Therefore, the correct output should be `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. However, the program returns `1`, which is incorrect.
