Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the calculation of the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. Specifically, the logic inside the while loop is flawed and does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs. 

For example, consider the test case `n = 3` and `m = 5`. According to the problem description, the valid pairs are:
- (1, 1)
- (2, 1)
- (2, 2)
- (3, 1)
- (3, 3)

However, the program will output a different result. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the number of valid pairs, particularly with the variable `g` and the logic inside the loop. This results in an incorrect count of valid pairs for many test cases.
