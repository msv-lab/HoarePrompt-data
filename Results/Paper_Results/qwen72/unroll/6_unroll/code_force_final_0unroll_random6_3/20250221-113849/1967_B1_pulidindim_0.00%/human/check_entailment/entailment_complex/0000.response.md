### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.

2. **Initial Count**:
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2. This is used to iterate over possible values of `b` starting from 2.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This is the initial count of valid pairs where `b = 1`, because for any `a` in the range `[1, n]`, the pair `(a, 1)` always satisfies the condition \( a + 1 \) is a multiple of \( 1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) \).

3. **Loop for `b` > 1**:
   - The loop iterates over possible values of `b` starting from 2 up to `m`.
   - For each `b`, it calculates `countmins` as `b - 1`.
   - It then calculates `g` as `n / b`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks. This is because if `g` is less than `b - 1`, there are no valid `a` values that can satisfy the condition for the current `b`.
   - Otherwise, it updates `g` by subtracting `countmins` and then adds \((g / b) + 1\) to `ans`.
   - The variable `count` is incremented by 1.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop completes, the function prints the integer value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Condition Check**:
  - The condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is checked by the loop.
  - For `b = 1`, the condition is always satisfied, so `ans` is initialized to `n`.

- **Loop Break Condition**:
  - The loop breaks if `g` (which is `n / b`) is less than `countmins` (which is `b - 1`). This ensures that the loop does not continue when there are no valid `a` values for the current `b`.

- **Update of `ans`**:
  - The update `ans += g / b + 1` is intended to count the number of valid `a` values for the current `b`. However, this logic is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the number of valid `a` values that satisfy the condition.

### Correctness:

- **Incorrect Calculation**:
  - The logic for updating `ans` is flawed. The expression `g / b + 1` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

- **Example Test Case**:
  - For the test case `n = 10` and `m = 8`, the correct number of valid pairs is 14, as given in the example output. However, the provided program does not correctly compute this value.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
