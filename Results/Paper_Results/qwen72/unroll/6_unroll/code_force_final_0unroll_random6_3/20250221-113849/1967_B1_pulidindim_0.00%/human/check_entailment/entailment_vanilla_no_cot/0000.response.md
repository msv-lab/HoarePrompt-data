Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `ans`**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. However, the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` is not necessarily equal to `n` at the start. The correct initialization should be `0`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The loop iterates over `count` from `2` to `m`, but the logic inside the loop is flawed. The calculation `g = n / count` and subsequent operations do not correctly determine the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Incorrect Break Condition**:
   - The break condition `if g < countmins` is not appropriate for this problem. The correct condition should be based on whether there are no more valid pairs to count.

4. **Incorrect Update of `ans`**:
   - The update `ans += g / count + 1` is incorrect. The number of valid pairs should be calculated based on the number of integers `a` that satisfy the given conditions for each `b`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to iterate over all possible values of `b` from `1` to `m` and for each `b`, count the number of valid `a` values from `1` to `n` that satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This program correctly iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition. However, this approach is not efficient for large values of `n` and `m` (up to `2 * 10^6`). For better performance, you would need to optimize the solution, possibly using number theory properties or dynamic programming techniques.
