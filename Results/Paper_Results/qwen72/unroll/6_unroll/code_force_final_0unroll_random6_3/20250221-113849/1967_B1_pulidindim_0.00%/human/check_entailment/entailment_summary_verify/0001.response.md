### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to \(n\).
   - It then enters a loop where it increments `count` starting from 2 up to \(m\).
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`.
   - It calculates `g` as \(n / \text{count}\).
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, it breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates `g` by subtracting `countmins` and then adds \((g / \text{count}) + 1\) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the integer value of `ans`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program's logic is not aligned with the problem's requirements. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not being checked or implemented correctly.
   - The calculation of `g` and the subsequent operations do not align with the mathematical requirements of the problem.
   - Specifically, the program does not correctly identify pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case \((1, 1)\), the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\), and the program should output 1.
   - For the fourth test case \((10, 8)\), the valid pairs are \((1,1)\), \((2,1)\), \((2,2)\), \((3,1)\), \((4,1)\), \((5,1)\), \((6,1)\), \((6,2)\), \((6,3)\), \((7,1)\), \((8,1)\), \((9,1)\), \((10,1)\), \((10,2)\), which are 14 pairs.
   - The program's logic does not seem to correctly identify these pairs. For example, the initial value of `ans` is set to \(n\), which is incorrect for the given problem.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.
