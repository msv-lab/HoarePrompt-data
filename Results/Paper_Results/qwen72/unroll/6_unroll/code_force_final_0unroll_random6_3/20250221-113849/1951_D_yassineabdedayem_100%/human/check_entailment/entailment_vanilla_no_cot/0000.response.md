Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem based on the given constraints and requirements. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` (number of coins Alice has) and `k` (number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).

2. **Logic**:
   - **Case 1**: If `n == k`, Bob can set up a single stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels from this stall, and the program correctly prints "YES" followed by 1 and 1.
   - **Case 2**: If `n + 2 > k * 2`, this condition ensures that Bob can set up two stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The first stall will have a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel, and the second stall will have a price of 1 coin per jewel.
     - Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall, spending `(k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins.
     - She will then have `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins left, which is enough to buy 1 jewel from the second stall.
     - The total number of jewels bought will be `k - 1 + 1 = k`.
   - **Case 3**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it is impossible for Bob to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, and the program correctly prints "NO".

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions.
   - If the answer is "YES", it prints the number of stalls and the prices for those stalls.

The program handles all the given constraints and test cases correctly, ensuring that Bob can set up the stalls as required. Therefore, the program is correct.
