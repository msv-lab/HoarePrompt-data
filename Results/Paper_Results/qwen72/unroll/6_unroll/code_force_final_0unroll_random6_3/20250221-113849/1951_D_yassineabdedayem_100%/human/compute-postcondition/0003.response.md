The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it is clear that the function is intended to work with test cases where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \le t \le 1000\), and for each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}\). The function returns a value based on the input parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (where \(1 \le t \le 1000\)) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (where \(1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}\)). The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.**
