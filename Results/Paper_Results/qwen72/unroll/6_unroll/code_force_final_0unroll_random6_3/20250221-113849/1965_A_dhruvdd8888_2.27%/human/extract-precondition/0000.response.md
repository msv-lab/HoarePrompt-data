It seems there was a mistake in the function definition provided. Based on the problem description, the function should take parameters for the number of test cases, the number of piles, and the list of piles. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def game_winner(t, n, piles):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and piles is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
