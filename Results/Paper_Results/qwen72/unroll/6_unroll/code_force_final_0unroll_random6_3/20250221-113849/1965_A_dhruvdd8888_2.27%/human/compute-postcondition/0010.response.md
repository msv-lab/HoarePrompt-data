Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `piles` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers converted from the set of strings from the input, and the length of `nums` is greater than 2. The value 0 has been inserted at the beginning of the list `nums`, making the new length of `nums` equal to the original length of `nums` plus 1. `cd` is 0.**
