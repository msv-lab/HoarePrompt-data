Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `idx` is 12.
   - `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
   - `results` is a list containing the string representations of the calculated values of `ans` for each test case.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('\n'.join(results))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `print` statement is using the `join` method to concatenate all the elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).
   - The `results` list contains string representations of the calculated values of `ans` for each test case. Since the exact values of `ans` for each test case are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `results`.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output each string in the `results` list, one per line.

Output: **Each string in the `results` list, one per line (where `results` is a list containing the string representations of the calculated values of `ans` for each test case)**
