Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case involves a number of sticks `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the exponents of the stick lengths. The function calculates the number of ways to choose pairs and triplets of sticks with the same exponent and appends these counts to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints the counts, one per line, as string values. The function does not return any value. **
