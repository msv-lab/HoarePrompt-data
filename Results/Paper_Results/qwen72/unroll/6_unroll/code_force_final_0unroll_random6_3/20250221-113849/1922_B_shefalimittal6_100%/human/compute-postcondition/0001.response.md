The code snippet reads a line of input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to the variable `data`. The initial state mentions the function `func_1` and its expected inputs, but the code snippet itself does not interact with `func_1` directly. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not directly affected by this code snippet, but `data` now holds the split input.

Output State: **The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the provided function definition does not include any. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, the number of sticks `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the exponents of the stick lengths. The inputs should satisfy the constraints: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, with the additional constraint that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5. The `input` function is now set to read from `sys.stdin`. `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
