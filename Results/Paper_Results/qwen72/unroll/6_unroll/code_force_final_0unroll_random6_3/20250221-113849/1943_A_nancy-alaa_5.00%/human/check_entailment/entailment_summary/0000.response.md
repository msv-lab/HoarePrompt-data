Reasoning:  
The program aims to determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. The key to solving this problem is understanding the optimal strategies of both players:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`. She should always pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` but is present in `a` to ensure that `c` contains as many small integers as possible.
2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`. He should always pick the smallest integer that is present in `a` to delay the inclusion of smaller integers in `c`.

Given these strategies, the program should correctly determine the MEX of `c` after all elements in `a` are processed. Let's analyze the program:

- **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- **Counting Elements**: The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `arr`.
- **Finding MEX**: The program iterates through the range `0` to `n-1` and checks:
  - If the integer `i` is not in `arr`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
  - If the integer `i` is present exactly once and it is the first such integer encountered, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.

The logic in the program is based on the following observations:
- If an integer `i` is not in `arr`, it is the smallest integer that is not present, and thus the MEX.
- If an integer `i` is present exactly once and it is the first such integer encountered, it means that Alice will pick it on her turn, and Bob will not be able to pick it again. Therefore, `i` will be the MEX.

However, the program does not explicitly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it relies on the fact that the optimal strategy will lead to the smallest integer `i` that is either not present in `arr` or present exactly once being the MEX. This approach is correct because:
- Alice will always pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` but is present in `a`.
- Bob will always pick the smallest integer that is present in `a`.

The program correctly identifies the MEX based on these observations.

Correctness: **True**
