Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem based on the given constraints and the optimal play strategy for Alice and Bob. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Counter Usage**: The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the array `c`.
   - The key insight is that Alice will always try to pick the smallest missing integer (MEX) that can be added to `c` to maximize the score, while Bob will try to prevent Alice from doing so by picking the smallest available integer that is not the MEX.

4. **Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the integers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - It checks if the current integer `i` is not in the `mpp` (Counter) keys. If it is not, this means `i` is the smallest integer that is missing from the array `arr`, and thus the MEX of `c` will be `i`.
   - If `i` is in the keys and its count is 1, it checks if it is the first time encountering such an integer. If it is the first time, it sets `first` to `True` and continues. If it is not the first time, it prints `i` as the MEX and breaks the loop.

This logic ensures that the program correctly determines the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The program handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
