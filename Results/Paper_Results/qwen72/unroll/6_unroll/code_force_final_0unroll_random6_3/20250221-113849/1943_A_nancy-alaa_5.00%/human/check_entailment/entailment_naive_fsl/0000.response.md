Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Specifically, the program does not ensure that Alice always maximizes the MEX and Bob always minimizes it. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 1 2 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
In this case, the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob would be:
1. Alice picks 2. Array `a` becomes `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, and array `c` becomes `[2]`.
2. Bob picks 0. Array `a` becomes `[1, 2, 3]`, and array `c` remains `[2]`.
3. Alice picks 1. Array `a` becomes `[2, 3]`, and array `c` becomes `[2, 1]`.
4. Bob picks 2. Array `a` becomes `[3]`, and array `c` remains `[2, 1]`.
5. Alice picks 3. Array `a` becomes `[]`, and array `c` becomes `[2, 1, 3]`.

The MEX of `[2, 1, 3]` is 4, but the program outputs 2, which is incorrect.

The program fails to correctly simulate the game's optimal strategy for both players, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
