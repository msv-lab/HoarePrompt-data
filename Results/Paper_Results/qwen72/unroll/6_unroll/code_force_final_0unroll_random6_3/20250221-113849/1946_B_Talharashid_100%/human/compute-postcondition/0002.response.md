The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, where `n` is the length of the list `a` and `k` is an additional integer parameter. `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given parameters and the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the elements of `a`.**
