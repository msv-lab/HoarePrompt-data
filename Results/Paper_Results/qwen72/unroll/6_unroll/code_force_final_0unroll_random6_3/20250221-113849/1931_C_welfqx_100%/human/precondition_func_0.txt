The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) for the array a, with each element a_i satisfying 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
