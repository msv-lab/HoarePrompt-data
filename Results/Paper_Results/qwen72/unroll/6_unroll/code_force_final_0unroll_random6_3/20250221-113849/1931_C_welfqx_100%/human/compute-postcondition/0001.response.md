The only objects in the loop head are the variables `r` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `r` is initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function, so it does not need to be adjusted. 

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `r` will start at 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is 0**
