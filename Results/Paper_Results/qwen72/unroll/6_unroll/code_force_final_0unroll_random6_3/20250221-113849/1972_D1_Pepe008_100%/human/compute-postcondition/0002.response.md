Output State: **The loop will execute `T` times, and for each execution, it will read two integers `a` and `b` from the input, perform the specified calculations, and print the result. After all iterations, the variable `t` will be equal to `T - 1` (the last index of the range), and the variables `info`, `a`, `b`, and `suma` will retain their values from the last iteration. The initial value of `T` will remain unchanged.**
