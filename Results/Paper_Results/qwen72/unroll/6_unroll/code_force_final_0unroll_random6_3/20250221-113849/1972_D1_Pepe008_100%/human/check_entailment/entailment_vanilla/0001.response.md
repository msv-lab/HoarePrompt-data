### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), we need to consider the properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd).
   - Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\).
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     d \cdot a' + d \cdot b' \equiv 0 \pmod{d \cdot b'}
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     a' + b' \equiv 0 \pmod{b'}
     \]
     This implies:
     \[
     a' \equiv -b' \pmod{b'}
     \]
     Since \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\), \(a'\) must be a multiple of \(b'\) plus some integer \(k\). However, \(a'\) and \(b'\) are coprime, so \(a' = b' \cdot k + b'\) where \(k\) is an integer.

3. **Simplification:**
   - For each \(b\), we need to find the number of valid \(a\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The program attempts to count these pairs by iterating over possible values of \(b\) and calculating the number of valid \(a\).

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes a variable `suma` to 0, which will store the count of valid pairs.
   - It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) (inclusive), where \(i\) represents \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates:
     \[
     x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - It checks if \(x > 0\) and adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - It then checks if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \mod i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \mod i^2 == 0\), and if so, adds 1 to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

5. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The formula used to calculate \(x\) is not correct. The correct approach should involve checking the gcd condition directly.
   - The additional check for \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \mod i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \mod i^2 == 0\) is unnecessary and incorrect.
   - The final `suma - 2` is also incorrect and does not align with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as described in the problem statement. The formula used and the additional checks are incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
