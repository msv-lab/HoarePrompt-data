You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, the function calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        
        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        
        print(suma - 2)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `T` times, and for each execution, it will read two integers `a` and `b` from the input, perform the specified calculations, and print the result. After all iterations, the variable `t` will be equal to `T - 1` (the last index of the range), and the variables `info`, `a`, `b`, and `suma` will retain their values from the last iteration. The initial value of `T` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `t`. `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6), and `t` is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, it returns the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 <= a <= n, 1 <= b <= m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
