Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of valid pairs is flawed.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of \(x\)**:
   - The program calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\). This formula is not derived from the problem statement and does not correctly count the number of valid pairs.
   - The condition \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\) is also not necessary and does not align with the problem requirements.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program subtracts 2 from the final sum (`suma - 2`). This is not explained by the problem statement and is likely incorrect.

### Example Case:
For the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the expected output is 3, as the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\). However, the program does not produce this output correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The correct implementation would involve calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and checking the condition for each pair.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly counts the number of valid pairs for each test case.
