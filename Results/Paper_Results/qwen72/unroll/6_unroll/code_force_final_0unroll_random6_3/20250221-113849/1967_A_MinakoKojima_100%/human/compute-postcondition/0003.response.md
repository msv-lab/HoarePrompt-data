The only objects in the loop head are the variable `a` and the list `ans_list`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ans_list`. If the list has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `ans_list` is a list containing the final answers for each test case, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute unless we confirm that `ans_list` is not empty.

For the loop to execute, `ans_list` must have at least one element, and `a` will be the first element in `ans_list`.

State: **`ans_list` is a list containing the final answers for each test case, where each answer is an integer representing the maximum number of cards that can be made equal by spending the given number of coins, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 Â· 10^5, `ans_list` must have at least one element, `a` is the first element in `ans_list`**
