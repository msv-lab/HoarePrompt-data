To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head only contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `_` is a placeholder used in the loop to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. This variable does not need to be adjusted as it is automatically managed by the loop.
2. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a positive integer. This means the user input must be a positive integer.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- `ans_list` is an empty list.

The state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` returns a positive integer, which will be the number of iterations the loop will perform. Since `t` represents the number of test cases, it is reasonable to assume that `int(input())` should be `t` for the loop to execute the correct number of times.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ans_list` is an empty list, `int(input())` must be `t` and must be greater than 0**
