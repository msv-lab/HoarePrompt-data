The function `func` accepts no parameters directly, but based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function will operate on inputs provided in a context where:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins, respectively.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of each type.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.

The function returns the result for each test case, which is not explicitly described in the output section. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the function returns a value or values that are determined by the inputs `n`, `k`, and `a` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of distinct types of cards (`n`), the number of coins (`k`), and a list of integers (`a`) representing the number of cards of each type. It returns a result for each test case, which is determined by the values of `n`, `k`, and `a`.**
