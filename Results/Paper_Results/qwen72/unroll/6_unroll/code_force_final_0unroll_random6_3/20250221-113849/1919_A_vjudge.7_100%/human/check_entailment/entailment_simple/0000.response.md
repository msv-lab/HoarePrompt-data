### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns making moves.
   - Each move consists of two steps: deciding whether to swap wallets, and then removing one coin from the current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., the wallet is empty) loses the game.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand that the game is essentially a parity game. The parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins (a + b) determines the outcome.
   - If the sum of the coins (a + b) is even, Bob will always win. This is because, after Alice's first move, the total number of coins will be odd, and Bob can always force the game to end in a state where Alice is left with an empty wallet.
   - If the sum of the coins (a + b) is odd, Alice will always win. This is because Alice can always force the game to end in a state where Bob is left with an empty wallet.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `test`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It then checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` using the bitwise AND operator (`&`). If `(a + b) & 1` is 0, the sum is even, and Bob wins. If it is 1, the sum is odd, and Alice wins.
   - The program prints the winner for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins.
   - The input and output handling is correct, and the program will work for the given constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9).

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
