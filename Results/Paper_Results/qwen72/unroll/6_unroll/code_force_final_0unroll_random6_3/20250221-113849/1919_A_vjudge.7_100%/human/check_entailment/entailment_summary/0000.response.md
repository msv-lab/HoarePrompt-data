Reasoning:  
The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns to either swap wallets or remove a coin from their current wallet, with the player who cannot make a valid move losing. The key to solving this problem is to understand the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins. If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally. If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally.

The given program checks the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`a + b`). If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints "Bob". If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice". This logic is based on the fact that the game will always end in a state where the total number of coins is 0 (an even number), and the player who makes the last move (i.e., the move that results in the total number of coins becoming 0) will win.

The program correctly implements this logic and processes multiple test cases as required. The execution summary confirms that the program reads the inputs and prints the correct outputs based on the parity of the sum of coins.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
