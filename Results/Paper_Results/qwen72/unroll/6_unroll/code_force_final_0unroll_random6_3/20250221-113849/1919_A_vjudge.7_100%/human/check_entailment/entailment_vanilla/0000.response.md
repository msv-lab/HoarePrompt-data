Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can choose to either swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet.
   - After making the decision, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses the game.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.
   - If a player has an empty wallet, they cannot make a move and thus lose.

3. **Key Insight**:
   - The game essentially reduces to a parity problem because each player must remove one coin per turn.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, then the number of turns will be even.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, then the number of turns will be odd.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - If the total number of coins is even, the game will end on an even turn, and Bob will be the last to make a move (since Alice starts).
   - If the total number of coins is odd, the game will end on an odd turn, and Alice will be the last to make a move.

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It checks if the sum of the coins (a + b) is even using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`).
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

6. **Bitwise AND Operation**:
   - The expression `a + b & 1` checks if the least significant bit of the sum `a + b` is 1 (i.e., if the sum is odd).
   - If `a + b & 1` is 0, the sum is even.
   - If `a + b & 1` is 1, the sum is odd.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
   - The logic is sound and matches the optimal play strategy described.

Correctness: **True**
