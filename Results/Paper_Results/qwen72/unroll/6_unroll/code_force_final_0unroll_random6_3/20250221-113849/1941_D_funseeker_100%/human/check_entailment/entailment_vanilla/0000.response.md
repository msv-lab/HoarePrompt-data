### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines and `int()` to convert them to integers. This is a standard way to handle input in Python for competitive programming, ensuring efficiency and correctness.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`. This correctly represents the initial state where the ball is with player `x`.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`. This correctly handles the clockwise throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`. This correctly handles the counterclockwise throw.
   - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and `0` should be converted to `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of player numbers. This ensures that the output is in the correct format and order.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws, considering the given constraints and the possibility of unknown directions. The use of sets to track possible positions and the handling of edge cases (converting `0` to `n`) are appropriate and ensure the program's correctness.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
