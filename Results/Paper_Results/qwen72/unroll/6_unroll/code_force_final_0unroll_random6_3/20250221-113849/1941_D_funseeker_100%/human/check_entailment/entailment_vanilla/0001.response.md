### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines and `func_3()` to split and map the input to integers. This is a standard way to handle input in Python and is correct for the given problem.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`. This is correct because it accounts for both clockwise throws and unknown directions.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`. This is also correct because it accounts for both counterclockwise throws and unknown directions.
   - The program then updates `ans` to be the set `temp`.

4. **Adjusting for Player Numbering:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because player numbers are from 1 to `n`, and `0` should be adjusted to `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball and then prints the sorted list of these players. This is correct as per the problem statement.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the input, processes each throw, and adjusts for player numbering. It also correctly outputs the number of possible players and the sorted list of these players. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
