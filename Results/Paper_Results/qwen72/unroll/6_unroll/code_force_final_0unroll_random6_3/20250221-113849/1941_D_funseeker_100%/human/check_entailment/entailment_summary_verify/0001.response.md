### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines and `func_3()` to split and map the input to integers. This is a standard way to handle input in Python and is correct for the given problem.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`. This is correct because it accounts for both clockwise throws and unknown directions.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`. This is also correct because it accounts for both counterclockwise throws and unknown directions.
   - The program then updates `ans` to be the set `temp`.

4. **Adjusting for Player Numbering:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because player numbers are from 1 to `n`, and `0` should be adjusted to `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball and then prints the sorted list of these players. This is correct as per the problem statement.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The program uses `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` to calculate the new positions. This is correct for handling circular positions, but there is a potential issue with negative results from `(q - r) % n`. In Python, the modulo operation with negative numbers can result in negative values, which is not what we want. We need to ensure that the result is always a non-negative integer within the range `[1, n]`.

- **Correction for Negative Modulo:**
  - To handle negative results correctly, we should use `(q - r) % n` and then adjust it to be within the range `[1, n]` by adding `n` if the result is `0`. This ensures that the position is always a valid player number.

### Corrected Code:

```python
import sys
from functools import lru_cache

# Function 1:
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())

# Function 3:
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))

# Function 4:
def func_4():
    (n, m, x) = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        (r, c) = func_1().split()
        r = int(r)
        temp = set()
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r - 1) % n + 1)  # Adjust for 1-based indexing
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r - 1) % n + 1)  # Adjust for 1-based indexing
        ans = temp
    print(len(ans))
    print(*sorted(ans))

# Reading the number of test cases
t = func_2()
for _ in range(t):
    func_4()
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Adjusting for 1-based Indexing:**
  - The original code uses modulo `n` directly, which can result in `0` for player positions. To handle 1-based indexing correctly, we adjust the positions by subtracting `1` before the modulo operation and then adding `1` after. This ensures that the positions are always within the range `[1, n]`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was mostly correct, but there was a subtle issue with handling negative results from the modulo operation. The corrected code addresses this issue and ensures that all positions are correctly adjusted to be within the valid range of player numbers.

Final: **True** (The program is correct after the adjustments.)
