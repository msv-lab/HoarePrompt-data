n is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), x is an integer representing the current player (1 ≤ x ≤ n), r is an integer representing the distance of the throw (1 ≤ r ≤ n - 1), and direction is a string that can be '0', '1', or '?' indicating the direction of the throw (clockwise, counterclockwise, or unknown).
