You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and x are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n.
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, `ans` is a set containing all unique values generated by adding or subtracting `r` to the initial value `x` (or any subsequent values in `ans`), and taking the result modulo `n`.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: *`n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, `ans` is a set containing all unique values generated by adding or subtracting `r` to the initial value `x` (or any subsequent values in `ans`), and taking the result modulo `n`. If 0 is in `ans`, the set `ans` no longer contains the value 0, and now includes the value `n`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where len(ans) is the number of unique values in the set `ans` after the transformations described in the initial state)
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: sorted unique values in `ans` (where `ans` is the set of all unique values generated by adding or subtracting `r` to the initial value `x` and any subsequent values in `ans`, and taking the result modulo `n`. If 0 is in `ans`, it is replaced by `n`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `x` with constraints `2 <= n <= 1000`, `1 <= m <= 1000`, and `1 <= x <= n`. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the exact output is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
