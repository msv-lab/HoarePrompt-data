To determine what will be printed by the `print(*sorted(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations that are performed on the set `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` are given and remain unchanged.
- `ans` is a set that initially contains the value `x`.
- The set `ans` is modified by adding or subtracting `r` to each value in `ans` and taking the result modulo `n`.
- If 0 is in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added to the set.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Value of `ans`**:
   - `ans` starts with the value `x`.

2. **Adding or Subtracting `r`**:
   - For each value in `ans`, we add `r` and subtract `r`, and take the result modulo `n`.
   - This means for each value `v` in `ans`, we add `v + r` and `v - r` to the set, and then take the result modulo `n`.

3. **Handling 0**:
   - If 0 is in the set `ans` after the above operations, it is removed, and `n` is added to the set.

4. **Sorting and Printing**:
   - The set `ans` is sorted, and the sorted values are printed.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume some values to understand the process better:
- Suppose `n = 7`, `x = 3`, and `r = 2`.

1. **Initial Set**:
   - `ans = {3}`

2. **Adding and Subtracting `r`**:
   - For `3`:
     - `3 + 2 = 5` (5 % 7 = 5)
     - `3 - 2 = 1` (1 % 7 = 1)
   - Now, `ans = {3, 5, 1}`

3. **Adding and Subtracting `r` Again**:
   - For `5`:
     - `5 + 2 = 7` (7 % 7 = 0)
     - `5 - 2 = 3` (3 % 7 = 3)
   - For `1`:
     - `1 + 2 = 3` (3 % 7 = 3)
     - `1 - 2 = -1` (-1 % 7 = 6)
   - Now, `ans = {3, 5, 1, 0, 6}`

4. **Handling 0**:
   - Since 0 is in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` (which is 7) is added.
   - Now, `ans = {3, 5, 1, 6, 7}`

5. **Sorting and Printing**:
   - The set `ans` is sorted: `{1, 3, 5, 6, 7}`
   - The sorted values are printed: `1 3 5 6 7`

### General Case:
- The set `ans` will contain all unique values generated by the operations described.
- If 0 is generated, it will be replaced by `n`.
- The final set will be sorted before printing.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the operations, the `print(*sorted(ans))` statement will print the sorted unique values in the set `ans` after the operations are performed.

Output: **sorted unique values in `ans` (where `ans` is the set of all unique values generated by adding or subtracting `r` to the initial value `x` and any subsequent values in `ans`, and taking the result modulo `n`. If 0 is in `ans`, it is replaced by `n`)**

This output is a precise description of what will be printed, given the initial state and the operations described.
