The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string. The state of `i` is automatically managed by the loop as it iterates over each character in `s`, so we don't need to adjust `i` explicitly. However, the state of `s` needs to be adjusted to ensure it has at least one character for the loop to execute.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n` where `n` is at least 1, each character is either '+' or '-', `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, and `neg` is 0**
