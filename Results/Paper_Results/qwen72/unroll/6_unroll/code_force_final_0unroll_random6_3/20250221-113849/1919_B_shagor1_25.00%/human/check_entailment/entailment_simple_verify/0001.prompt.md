You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

    neg = 0
    for i in s:

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually take two parameters: `s` (a string of length n where each character is either '+' or '-') and `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000). Additionally, the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, so the input should include an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is a string of length `n` where each character is either '+' or '-', `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, and `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
    #This is printed: - If `n == neg`, the output will be `n`.
    #   - If `n != neg`, the output will be `n - 2 * neg`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - Each character `+` corresponds to `1` and each character `-` corresponds to `-1`.
   - We need to split the string into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The goal is to find the minimum possible total penalty.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
   - Inside `func_1`, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of `-` characters in the string and stores it in `neg`.
   - It then prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The penalty of a subarray is `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.
   - If the string `s` is split into subarrays such that each subarray has a sum of zero, the penalty of each subarray will be zero.
   - The optimal way to split the string is to ensure that the sum of each subarray is zero whenever possible.
   - If the number of `+` and `-` characters is equal, the string can be split into subarrays with a sum of zero, resulting in a total penalty of zero.
   - If the number of `+` and `-` characters is not equal, the optimal split will still try to balance the sums as much as possible, but there will be a residual penalty.

4. **Checking the Formula:**
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is derived from the idea that each `+` and `-` pair can be balanced to zero, reducing the penalty.
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the formula `n - 2 * neg` correctly calculates the minimum penalty by balancing as many pairs as possible.
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means the string consists entirely of `-` characters, and the penalty is simply the length of the string `n`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the string consists entirely of `+` or `-` characters.
   - It also handles the case where the string has an equal number of `+` and `-` characters, resulting in a penalty of zero.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for the given problem. The formula used is correct and the program handles all edge cases as expected.
