The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `s`, and `n`. `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. `s` is a string of length n, where each character is either '+' or '-', and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000. For each test case, the function processes the string `s` and returns a result based on the contents of `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer indicating the number of test cases, 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `s` (a string of length n where each character is either '+' or '-', 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000), and `n` (an integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000). For each test case, it processes the string `s` and returns a result based on the contents of `s`.**
