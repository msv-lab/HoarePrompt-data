The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `num2`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num2`. The loop will execute if `num2` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is not yet defined, but it will start at 1. The state of `a` and `order` are not relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `num2` must be greater than 1, `order` is 0, `i` is 1**
