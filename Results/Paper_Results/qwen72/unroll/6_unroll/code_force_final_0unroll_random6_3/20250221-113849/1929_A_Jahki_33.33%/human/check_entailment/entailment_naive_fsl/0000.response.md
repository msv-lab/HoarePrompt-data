Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where all elements in the array are the same. According to the problem description, if all elements are the same, the beauty should be 0. However, the program incorrectly prints 0 only when the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
The expected output is `0` because all elements are the same, and thus the beauty is 0. However, the program will print `0` only if the array is already sorted, which in this case it is, but the logic is flawed because it should always print `0` for arrays with identical elements regardless of their initial order.

The function `func_1` checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, but this is not the correct condition to determine if the beauty is 0. The correct condition should be whether all elements in the array are the same. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
