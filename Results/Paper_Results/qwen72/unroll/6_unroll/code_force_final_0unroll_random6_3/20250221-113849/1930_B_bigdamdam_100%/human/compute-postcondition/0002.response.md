The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case is defined by a single integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of a permutation. The function accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) indicating the number of test cases. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function returns the result for each test case based on the provided `n` values.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of a permutation. The function returns the result for each test case based on the provided `n` values, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
