### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` using `n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]`. This is a valid way to read a single integer from a line of input.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The function initializes a list `p` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the even-indexed positions (0, 2, 4, ...) of `p` with the largest odd numbers in descending order.
   - After that, it fills the odd-indexed positions (1, 3, 5, ...) of `p` with the smallest odd numbers in ascending order.

3. **Validation of Permutation:**
   - The permutation `p` is constructed such that the even-indexed positions are filled with the largest odd numbers and the odd-indexed positions are filled with the smallest odd numbers.
   - This ensures that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) will have `p_i` dividing `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` dividing `p_{j+1}` because:
     - The largest odd numbers are placed in even positions, and the smallest odd numbers are placed in odd positions.
     - The largest odd number will not divide any smaller odd number, and the smallest odd number will not divide any larger odd number.
     - The even-indexed positions and odd-indexed positions are filled in a way that avoids any such division relationship.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the constructed permutation for each test case using `print(*p)`, which correctly outputs the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is 3 correctly. For `n = 3`, the permutation `[1, 2, 3]` is valid, and the function will output this permutation.
   - The function also handles larger values of `n` correctly by ensuring the permutation is constructed according to the specified rules.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a permutation for each test case that meets the problem's requirements. The logic ensures that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` will have `p_i` dividing `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` dividing `p_{j+1}`.

### Correctness:
**True**
