You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        print(*p)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and prints a permutation of the integers from 1 to n. The permutation is constructed such that even-indexed positions (0, 2, 4, ...) are filled with the largest odd numbers in descending order, and odd-indexed positions (1, 3, 5, ...) are filled with the smallest odd numbers in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final state includes the printed permutations for each test case. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The given program uses a specific strategy to construct the permutation:
     - It initializes a list \( p \) of length \( n \) with zeros.
     - It then fills the even indices of \( p \) with the largest odd numbers in descending order.
     - It fills the odd indices of \( p \) with the smallest odd numbers in ascending order.
   - This strategy ensures that the permutation \( p \) does not have the property where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \) for any \( i \) and \( j \).

3. **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
   - **Input Reading:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
     - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \).
   - **Permutation Construction:**
     - It initializes a list \( p \) of length \( n \) with zeros.
     - It sets the even indices of \( p \) with the largest odd numbers in descending order.
     - It sets the odd indices of \( p \) with the smallest odd numbers in ascending order.
   - **Output:**
     - The program prints the constructed permutation \( p \).

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - **Even Indices:**
     - The even indices are filled with the largest odd numbers in descending order. This ensures that the even indices do not form a sequence where one number divides another.
   - **Odd Indices:**
     - The odd indices are filled with the smallest odd numbers in ascending order. This ensures that the odd indices do not form a sequence where one number divides another.
   - **Combining Even and Odd Indices:**
     - By alternating between the largest and smallest odd numbers, the program ensures that no two adjacent numbers in the permutation can both be divisors of two other adjacent numbers in the permutation.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the constraints \( 3 \leq n \leq 10^5 \) and \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^3 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \), the program will output a valid permutation like \( [3, 1, 2] \) or \( [1, 2, 3] \), which are both valid.

6. **Example Verification:**
   - For \( n = 4 \), the program outputs \( [4, 1, 2, 3] \).
     - \( p_0 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 2 \).
     - \( p_1 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 3 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \), the program outputs \( [1, 2, 3] \).
     - This is a valid permutation as no two adjacent numbers form a divisor relationship.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly constructs a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) that satisfies the problem's constraints and requirements.
