Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the permutation. The number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
