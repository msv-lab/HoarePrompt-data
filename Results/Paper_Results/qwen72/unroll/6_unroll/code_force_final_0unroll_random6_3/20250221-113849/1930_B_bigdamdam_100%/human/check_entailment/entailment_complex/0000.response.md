### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The function initializes a list `p` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the even-indexed positions (0, 2, 4, ...) with the largest odd numbers in descending order.
   - It fills the odd-indexed positions (1, 3, 5, ...) with the smallest odd numbers in ascending order.

3. **Validation of Permutation**:
   - The permutation is constructed such that the even-indexed positions contain the largest odd numbers in descending order, and the odd-indexed positions contain the smallest odd numbers in ascending order.
   - This ensures that no two adjacent elements in the permutation can both be odd or both be even, which helps in avoiding the condition where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` for any distinct indices `i` and `j`.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n = 4`, the permutation `[4, 1, 2, 3]` is generated. This permutation is valid because:
     - `p_0 = 4` (even) does not divide `p_2 = 2` (even).
     - `p_1 = 1` (odd) does not divide `p_3 = 3` (odd).
   - For `n = 3`, the permutation `[1, 2, 3]` is generated. This permutation is valid because:
     - `p_0 = 1` (odd) does not divide `p_2 = 3` (odd).
     - `p_1 = 2` (even) does not divide `p_3` (out of bounds).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the minimum value of `n` (which is 3) correctly.
   - The function also handles the maximum value of `n` (up to 10^5) by ensuring the permutation is constructed in a way that avoids the divisibility condition.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The function is efficient as it constructs the permutation in linear time, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a permutation for each test case that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
