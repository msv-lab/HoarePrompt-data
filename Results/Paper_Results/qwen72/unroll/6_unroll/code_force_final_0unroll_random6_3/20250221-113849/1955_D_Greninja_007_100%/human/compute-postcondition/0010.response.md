The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`.
- `m` is an integer representing the length of the list `b` and the length of the sublists to be considered in `a`.
- `k` is an integer that sets the threshold for the sum of the minimum frequencies of common elements between a sublist of `a` and `b`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 10^6.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers, where each integer `b_i` is between 1 and 10^6.

The function returns the number of sublists of length `m` in `a` that have a sum of the minimum frequencies of common elements with `b` greater than or equal to `k`.
