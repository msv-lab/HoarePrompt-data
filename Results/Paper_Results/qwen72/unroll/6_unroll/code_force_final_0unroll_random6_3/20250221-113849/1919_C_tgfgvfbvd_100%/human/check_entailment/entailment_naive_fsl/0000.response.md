Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array into two subsequences. The issue lies in the way the program updates the values of `a` and `b` and the penalty counter `c`.

### Problem with the Logic:
1. **Initialization of `a` and `b`**:
   - The program initializes `a` and `b` to `float('inf')`, which is incorrect because the problem specifies that the elements of the array `a` are between 1 and `n`. This initialization can lead to incorrect comparisons.

2. **Updating `a` and `b`**:
   - The program updates `a` and `b` in a way that does not ensure the optimal split of the array. Specifically, the condition `if a > b: (a, b) = (b, a)` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect values being assigned to `a` and `b`.

3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The program increments the penalty counter `c` whenever an element is greater than both `a` and `b`. This does not correctly calculate the penalty as defined in the problem statement. The penalty should be the number of indices `i` where `b_i < b_{i + 1}` in the subsequences `s` and `t`.

### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The expected output is `3`, but the program will not produce this output. The program's logic for updating `a` and `b` and calculating the penalty is flawed, leading to an incorrect result.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. Identify the optimal way to split the array into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the penalty `p(s) + p(t)` is minimized.
2. The penalty `p(b)` for an array `b` is the number of indices `i` where `b_i < b_{i + 1}`.
3. The optimal way to split the array is to ensure that the subsequences are as non-increasing as possible, which minimizes the number of increasing pairs.

The given program does not follow this approach and hence is incorrect.
