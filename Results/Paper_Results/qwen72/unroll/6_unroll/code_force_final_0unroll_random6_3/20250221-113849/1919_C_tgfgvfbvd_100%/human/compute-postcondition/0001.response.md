Output State: **For each test case, the variable `c` will hold the number of elements in the list `l` that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest elements found in `l`. The variables `a` and `b` will hold the smallest and the second smallest elements in `l`, respectively, but their final values are not part of the output. The loop will print the value of `c` for each test case.**
