The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `a`, a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The total number of test cases `t` is also a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters `n` and `a`. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints, so we can only describe the general functionality in terms of the parameters it accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one, but the exact nature of the result is not specified in the constraints.**
