The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 5000, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers, each within the range 1 to 10^7. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the exact return value is not specified.**
