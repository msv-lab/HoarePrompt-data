The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers from the input. It then calculates the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers from the list and appends this sum to a list `ans_f`. After processing all test cases, it prints each integer in `ans_f`, where each integer represents the sum of the minimum values of pairs from the corresponding input list. The function does not return any value.
