Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings s_list where each string s in s_list has a length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

However, the provided function definition is missing the parameters. It should be corrected to:
```
def func(t, s_list):
```

This ensures that the function can properly handle the input as described in the problem.
