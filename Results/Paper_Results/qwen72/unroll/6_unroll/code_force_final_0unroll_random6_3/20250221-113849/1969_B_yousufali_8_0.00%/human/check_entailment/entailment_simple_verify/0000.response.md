### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that `func_1` is reading the input as a list of integers using `list(map(int, input().split()))`. This is problematic because the input is a binary string, not a list of integers. The `split()` method will split the string on spaces, which is not what we want for a binary string.
   - The correct way to read a binary string is to use `input().strip()` to get the string and then convert it to a list of integers using `list(map(int, input().strip()))` or simply `input().strip()` if you want to keep it as a string.

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**:
   - The original assessment also correctly points out that the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to sort the binary string.
   - The current logic in `func_1` increments `ans` by `n + 1` for each `0` encountered after a `1`. This is not the correct approach to solve the problem. The correct approach involves finding the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.
   - For a binary string to be sorted in non-descending order, all `1`s should come before all `0`s. The minimum cost to achieve this is the length of the longest contiguous segment of `1`s or `0`s that needs to be moved to the beginning of the string.

3. **Handling Already Sorted Strings**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted. For example, for the input "0000", the correct output should be 0, but the current program will output a non-zero value because it does not check if the string is already sorted.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the issues identified in the input parsing and the logic for cost calculation, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Final: False**
