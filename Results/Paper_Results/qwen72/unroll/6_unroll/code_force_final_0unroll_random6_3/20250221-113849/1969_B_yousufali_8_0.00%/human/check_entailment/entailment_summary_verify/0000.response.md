### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing Issue**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the input string using `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which is incorrect for the given problem. The input is a binary string, not a list of integers. This will cause the program to fail to parse the input correctly.
   - For example, if the input is "10", `input().split()` will return `['10']`, and `list(map(int, ['10']))` will result in `[10]`, which is not the intended list `[1, 0]`.

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the cost of sorting the binary string by counting the number of 1s (`n`) and adding `n + 1` to the answer (`ans`) whenever a 0 is encountered and `n` is not zero.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the cyclic shifts needed to sort the string. The correct approach should involve finding the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to bring all 1s to the end of the string.

3. **Handling Already Sorted Strings**:
   - The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the string is already sorted. For example, for the input "0000", the correct output should be 0, but the current logic will incorrectly compute a non-zero cost.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Read the input string as a string.
- Determine the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to sort the string by finding the longest contiguous segment of 1s that can be moved to the end of the string with the minimum cost.

### Example of Correct Logic:
- For the input "10":
  - The optimal cyclic shift is to move the last character to the front: "10" -> "01". The cost is 2.
- For the input "0000":
  - The string is already sorted, so the cost is 0.
- For the input "11000":
  - One optimal strategy is to perform three cyclic shifts: "11000" -> "01100" -> "00110" -> "00011". The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.
- For the input "101011":
  - One optimal strategy is to perform two cyclic shifts: "101011" -> "110101" -> "111010". The total cost is 3 + 2 = 5.
- For the input "01101001":
  - One optimal strategy is to perform three cyclic shifts: "01101001" -> "10110100" -> "11011010" -> "11101100". The total cost is 4 + 3 + 4 = 11.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the input and output as specified in the problem description, and it does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using the specified cyclic shift operation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
