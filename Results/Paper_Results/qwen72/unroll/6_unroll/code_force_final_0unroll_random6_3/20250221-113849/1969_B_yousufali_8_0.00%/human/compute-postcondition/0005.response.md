To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a list that remains unchanged.
   - `n` is the number of 1s in the list `s`.
   - `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 encountered after a 1 in the list `s`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `s` is a list of integers, typically containing 0s and 1s.
   - `n` is the count of 1s in the list `s`.
   - `ans` is calculated by iterating through the list `s` and for each 0 that appears after a 1, adding `n + 1` to `ans`.

3. **Calculation of `ans`:**
   - We need to count the number of 1s in `s` to determine `n`.
   - Then, we need to iterate through `s` and for each 0 that appears after a 1, add `n + 1` to `ans`.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `s = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`.
   - `n` is the number of 1s in `s`, which is 3.
   - We iterate through `s`:
     - The first 0 is after the first 1, so we add `3 + 1 = 4` to `ans`.
     - The second 0 is after the second 1, so we add `3 + 1 = 4` to `ans`.
     - The third 0 is after the third 1, so we add `3 + 1 = 4` to `ans`.
   - Therefore, `ans` will be `4 + 4 + 4 = 12`.

5. **General Case:**
   - If `s` contains `k` 0s that appear after a 1, and `n` is the number of 1s in `s`, then `ans` will be `k * (n + 1)`.

6. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 encountered after a 1 in the list `s`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of n + 1 for each 0 encountered after a 1 in the list s, and n is the number of 1s in the list s)**
