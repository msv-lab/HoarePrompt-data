### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires sorting a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each shift is the length of the substring.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of these operations.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
     - It correctly handles the input and the loop structure for multiple test cases.
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function reads a binary string from input and processes it to calculate the minimum total cost to sort the string.
     - It initializes `n` to count the number of 1s and `ans` to accumulate the cost.
     - For each character in the string:
       - If the character is 1, it increments `n`.
       - If the character is 0 and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

3. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is based on the observation that each time a 0 is encountered after a 1, a cyclic shift is needed to move the 1s to the left of the 0s.
   - The cost of each shift is `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of 1s seen so far.
   - This approach correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Already Sorted String:**
     - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), `n` will never be incremented when a 0 is encountered, so `ans` remains 0, which is correct.
   - **String with No 0s:**
     - If the string contains only 1s (e.g., "1111"), `ans` will remain 0, which is correct.
   - **String with No 1s:**
     - If the string contains only 0s (e.g., "0000"), `ans` will remain 0, which is correct.
   - **General Case:**
     - For a string like "11000", the function correctly calculates the cost as 9, which matches the example provided.

5. **Input Handling:**
   - The input is handled correctly in both functions. `func_2` reads the number of test cases, and `func_1` reads the binary string for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem of sorting a binary string using cyclic shifts and calculating the minimum total cost. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to handle multiple test cases and produce the correct output for each.

**Correctness: True**
