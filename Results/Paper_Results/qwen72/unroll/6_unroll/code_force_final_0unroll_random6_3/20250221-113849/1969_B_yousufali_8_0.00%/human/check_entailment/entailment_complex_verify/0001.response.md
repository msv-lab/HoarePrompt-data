### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires sorting a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum cost of cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring is the length of the substring.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of all operations required to sort the string.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the processing of a single binary string.
   - The function reads the input string using `input().split()`, which is incorrect for a binary string. This method splits the input by spaces, which is not suitable for a continuous binary string.
   - The variable `n` is used to count the number of 1s encountered.
   - The variable `ans` is used to accumulate the cost of the operations.
   - The loop iterates through the string, and for each 0 encountered after at least one 1, it adds `n + 1` to the cost. This logic is correct because each 0 encountered after a 1 indicates that the 1s need to be moved to the left, and the cost of moving a block of `n` 1s is `n + 1` (the length of the substring including the 0).

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to handle multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The issue with `func_1` is that it reads the input string in an incorrect way, which will cause the program to fail when processing the binary strings.

4. **Correctness of Input Handling:**
   - The input handling in `func_1` is indeed incorrect. It should read the binary string as a single string and then convert it to a list of integers.
   - The correct way to read the binary string is `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))`.

5. **Correctness of Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` for calculating the minimum cost to sort the binary string is correct. It correctly identifies the cost of moving 1s to the left of 0s.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect due to the input handling issue in `func_1`. The function `func_1` should read the binary string as a single string and then convert it to a list of integers.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem.
