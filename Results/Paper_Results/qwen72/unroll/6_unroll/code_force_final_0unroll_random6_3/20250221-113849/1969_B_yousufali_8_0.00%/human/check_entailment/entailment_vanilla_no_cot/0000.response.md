Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Input Parsing in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to read a binary string, but it uses `input().split()`, which is intended for splitting a string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. For a binary string, you should simply read the string as is using `input()`.

2. **Conversion to List of Integers**:
   - The function converts the input string to a list of integers using `list(map(int, input().split()))`. This will not work correctly for a binary string because it will split the string into individual characters and then convert them to integers, but the `split` method will not work as expected. Instead, you should convert the string to a list of integers using a list comprehension like `list(map(int, input()))`.

3. **Logic for Calculating the Cost**:
   - The logic for calculating the cost is incorrect. The function `func_1` is trying to count the number of 1s and then add the cost whenever a 0 is encountered. However, this does not correctly account for the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts.

4. **Output**:
   - The function `func_1` prints the result directly, which is not appropriate for handling multiple test cases. The output should be collected and printed after all test cases are processed.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
- Read the number of test cases.
- For each test case, read the binary string.
- Calculate the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts.
- Print the result for each test case.

The correct logic involves finding the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to move all 1s to the right of all 0s. This can be done by:
- Counting the number of 1s in the string.
- Calculating the cost of shifting each 1 to the right of all 0s.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    ones = s.count('1')
    cost = 0
    current_ones = 0
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            current_ones += 1
        cost = i + 1 + ones - current_ones
        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    
    return min_cost

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        results.append(min_cost_to_sort(s))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`min_cost_to_sort(s)`**:
  - This function calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string `s`.
  - It counts the total number of 1s in the string.
  - It iterates through the string, keeping track of the number of 1s encountered so far (`current_ones`).
  - It calculates the cost of shifting the current substring to the right and updates the minimum cost.
- **`func_2()`**:
  - This function reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, it reads the binary string, calls `min_cost_to_sort(s)`, and stores the result.
  - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

This corrected program will correctly solve the problem as described.
