Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the reversal of digits for Anna's turn correctly. The function `func_1` is supposed to count trailing zeros, but the program does not actually reverse the digits of the numbers as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros can be used to determine the winner, but this does not account for the actual values of the numbers and the optimal play strategy.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
According to the problem description, Anna can reverse the digits of either 14 or 2. If she reverses 14 to 41, Sasha can concatenate 41 and 2 to get 412, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Therefore, Sasha wins. However, if Anna reverses 2 to 2 (which remains the same), Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to get 214, which is also greater than \(10^2 = 100\). So, Sasha wins in both cases. The program, however, does not correctly simulate this scenario and may produce incorrect results.

Another example:
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```
Anna can reverse 9 to 9, 56 to 65, or 1 to 1. If Anna reverses 56 to 65, Sasha can concatenate 65 and 9 to get 659, and then concatenate 659 and 1 to get 6591, which is greater than \(10^5 = 100000\). Therefore, Sasha wins. The program does not correctly handle this scenario either.

These examples demonstrate that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and thus it is incorrect.
