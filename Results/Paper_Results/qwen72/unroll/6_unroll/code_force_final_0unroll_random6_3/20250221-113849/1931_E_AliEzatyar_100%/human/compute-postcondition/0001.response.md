The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `num`. The loop will execute if `len(num) - 1` is greater than or equal to -1, which is always true as long as `num` is not empty. Therefore, the loop will execute if `num` has at least one element. The variable `i` should start from `len(num) - 1` and decrement until it reaches -1.

Given the initial state:
- `num` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each integer a_i in num satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `m` is an integer where 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6.
- `counter` is 0.

For the loop to execute, `num` must have at least one element, and `i` should be initialized to `len(num) - 1`.

State: **`num` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each integer a_i in num satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6, `counter` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`**
