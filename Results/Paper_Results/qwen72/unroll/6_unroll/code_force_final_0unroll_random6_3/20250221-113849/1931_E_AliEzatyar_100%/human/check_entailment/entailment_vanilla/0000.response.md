### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` and the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting and Zero Trailing Count**:
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to 0 and `zeros` to an empty list.
   - It iterates over each item in the array, adding the length of the item (number of digits) to `total_digits`.
   - It uses `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in each item and appends this count to the `zeros` list.

3. **Trailing Zeros Handling**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly counts the trailing zeros in a string representation of a number.
   - The `zeros` list is then sorted in descending order.

4. **Subtracting Trailing Zeros**:
   - The program initializes `subtract_zero` to 0.
   - It iterates over the `zeros` list in steps of 2, adding the value of each element to `subtract_zero`. This is intended to simulate the effect of Anna's moves, where she can reverse the digits of a number, potentially reducing the total number of digits in the list.

5. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If the condition is met, it sets the answer to "Sasha", otherwise it sets the answer to "Anna".

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Total Digits Calculation**:
  - The total number of digits in the list is correctly calculated by summing the lengths of the string representations of the numbers.

- **Trailing Zeros**:
  - The trailing zeros are correctly counted and stored in the `zeros` list.
  - Sorting the `zeros` list in descending order is a good strategy to maximize the effect of Anna's moves.

- **Subtracting Trailing Zeros**:
  - The program subtracts the trailing zeros in pairs, which is a reasonable approach to simulate Anna's optimal play.
  - However, the logic of subtracting trailing zeros in pairs might not fully capture the optimal strategy for Anna. Specifically, Anna can reverse any number, and the effect of reversing a number with trailing zeros is not just removing those zeros but also changing the order of the digits.

- **Winning Condition**:
  - The condition `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` is intended to check if the remaining digits after Anna's optimal play can form a number greater than or equal to \(10^m\).
  - This condition might be too simplistic. For example, if the total number of digits is just slightly more than `m`, and all the trailing zeros are removed, the remaining number might still be less than \(10^m\).

### Conclusion:

The program's logic for counting trailing zeros and subtracting them in pairs is a good start, but it may not fully capture the optimal strategy for Anna. The winning condition might be too simplistic and could lead to incorrect results in some cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not fully account for the optimal play of both players, especially in how Anna's moves can affect the final number. A more detailed analysis of the game's rules and the optimal strategies for both players is needed to ensure the program's correctness.
