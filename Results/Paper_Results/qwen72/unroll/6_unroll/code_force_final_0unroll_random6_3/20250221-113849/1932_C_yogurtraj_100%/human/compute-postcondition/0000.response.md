The only object in the loop head is the variable `ii`, and the loop depends on the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input provided must be a positive integer, as the loop will run from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input is a positive integer, and `ii` is initialized to 0.

State: **`ii` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
