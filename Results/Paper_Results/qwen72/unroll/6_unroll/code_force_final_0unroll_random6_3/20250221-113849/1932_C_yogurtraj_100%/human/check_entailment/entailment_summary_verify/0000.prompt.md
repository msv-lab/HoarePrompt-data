You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

    0 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 4 4 4

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Program:
def func():
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        t = input()
        l = t.count('L')
        k = 0
        q1 = 0
        q2 = 0
        if t[-1] == 'L':
            k = a[l - 1] % m
            q1 = l - 2
            q2 = l
        else:
            k = a[l] % m
            q1 = l - 1
            q2 = l + 1
        y = [0] * n
        y[-1] = k
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if t[i] == 'R':
                k = k * a[q2] % m
                q2 += 1
            else:
                k = k * a[q1] % m
                q1 -= 1
            y[i] = k
        print(*y)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `m`, a list of `n` integers `a`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters 'L' and 'R'. It computes a list `y` of `n` integers where each element is derived based on the characters in `s` and the values in `a`, modulo `m`. The function prints the list `y` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution, and the program ends.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the removal of elements from the array and the calculation of the product modulo `m` for each command. Specifically, the logic for determining the initial value of `k` and the indices `q1` and `q2` is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 2 4 1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0 2 2 2
```

The program fails to correctly update the product and indices as elements are removed from the array. For example, after the first command 'L', the array becomes `[1, 4, 2]`, and the product modulo `m` should be `2`, which is correct. However, after the second command 'R', the array becomes `[1, 4]`, and the product modulo `m` should be `4`, but the program incorrectly outputs `2`. This indicates that the logic for updating the product and indices is incorrect.
