The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is inferred that the function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, and an additional parameter `t` that represents the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^3. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.

However, since the specific output for each test case is not provided, we can only describe the parameters and the general expectation of the return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^3. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
