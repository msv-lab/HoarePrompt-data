Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when \( k \) is between 1 and \( n \) (exclusive), but not equal to 1 or \( n \). For example, consider the input \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \). The program will output \(-1\), but there exists a valid array that satisfies the conditions. One such valid array is \([1, 2, 1, 2]\), which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: \([1, 2, 1, 2]\) and \([2, 1, 2, 1]\). Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
