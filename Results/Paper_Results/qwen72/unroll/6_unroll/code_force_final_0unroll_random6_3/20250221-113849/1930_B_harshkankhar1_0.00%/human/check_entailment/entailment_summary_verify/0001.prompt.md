You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a single integer `n` where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. It generates a list `a` containing the integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order. The function then reverses the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) while keeping the elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) unchanged. Finally, it prints the modified list `a`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to generate a permutation of length `n` such that for any two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j), the conditions `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` do not hold simultaneously.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`.
   - It generates a list `a` containing the integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list `a`.
   - Finally, it prints the modified list `a`.

3. **Checking the Permutation Validity**:
   - The list `a` initially contains the integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order.
   - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the elements at odd indices remain in their original positions, while the elements at even indices are reversed.
   - This approach is designed to break the divisibility pattern that might exist in the original list.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For `n = 4`, the initial list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - Reversing the elements at even indices (0 and 2) gives `[3, 2, 1, 4]`.
   - For `n = 3`, the initial list is `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - Reversing the element at even index (0) gives `[3, 2, 1]`.

5. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify if the generated permutations meet the problem's requirements:
     - For `n = 4`, the permutation `[3, 2, 1, 4]`:
       - `p_1 = 3` does not divide `p_3 = 1`.
       - `p_2 = 2` does not divide `p_4 = 4`.
       - `p_1 = 3` does not divide `p_2 = 2`.
       - `p_2 = 2` does not divide `p_1 = 3`.
       - `p_3 = 1` does not divide `p_4 = 4`.
       - `p_4 = 4` does not divide `p_3 = 1`.
     - For `n = 3`, the permutation `[3, 2, 1]`:
       - `p_1 = 3` does not divide `p_2 = 2`.
       - `p_2 = 2` does not divide `p_3 = 1`.
       - `p_1 = 3` does not divide `p_3 = 1`.

6. **General Case**:
   - The approach of reversing the elements at even indices ensures that the elements at even positions are not in their original order, which helps in breaking the divisibility pattern.
   - This method works because it ensures that no two consecutive elements at even positions can both divide two consecutive elements at odd positions, and vice versa.

### Conclusion:
The provided program generates a valid permutation that meets the problem's requirements. The approach of reversing the elements at even indices is effective in breaking the divisibility pattern.
