You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        max = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        print(max)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array a, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a. The total number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        
        max = 0
        
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        
        print(max)
        
    #State: The loop executes `t` times, processing each test case. For each test case, if `n` is 2, the minimum value of the two elements in the array `a` is printed. If `n` is greater than 2, the maximum of the second largest elements from every consecutive triplet in the array `a` is printed. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not retained between test cases, and their values are reset for each new test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, if `n` is 2, the function prints the minimum value of the two elements in the array `a`. If `n` is greater than 2, the function prints the maximum of the second largest elements from every consecutive triplet in the array `a`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are reset for each new test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not handle the correct logic for all potential cases. Specifically, it only considers subarrays of length 3, which is insufficient to solve the problem as described. The problem requires considering subarrays of any length (2 ≤ l < r ≤ n) and finding the maximum possible value that the array can be transformed into.

Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
2
3
1 2 3
4
1 3 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
2
```

In the second test case, the program outputs 2, but the correct answer should be 3. Here's why:

- For the subarray [1, 3, 2, 4], the median of the subarray [1, 3, 2] is 2, and the median of the subarray [3, 2, 4] is 3.
- If Mocha chooses the interval (l, r) = (2, 4), the subarray [3, 2, 4] has a median of 3, and the array can be transformed to [1, 3, 3, 3].
- If Mocha then chooses the interval (l, r) = (1, 4), the subarray [1, 3, 3, 3] has a median of 3, and the array can be transformed to [3, 3, 3, 3].

Thus, the maximum possible value of the number is 3, but the program incorrectly outputs 2.
