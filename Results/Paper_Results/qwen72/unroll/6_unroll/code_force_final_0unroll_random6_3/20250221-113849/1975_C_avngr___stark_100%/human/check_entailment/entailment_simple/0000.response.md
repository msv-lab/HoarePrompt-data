### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If `n` is 2, the function prints the minimum of the two elements in the array. This is correct because, with only two elements, the only possible median is the smaller of the two, and the array will be changed to `[min(a), min(a)]`.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - For `n` greater than 2, the function iterates over every possible consecutive triplet in the array.
   - It sorts each triplet and checks the second element (the median of the triplet).
   - It keeps track of the maximum median found among all triplets.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum median.

4. **Logic for Finding the Maximum Median:**
   - The logic of finding the maximum median among all consecutive triplets is correct because the median of any subarray of length 3 will be the middle element when sorted.
   - By iterating over all possible triplets and keeping track of the maximum median, the function ensures that it finds the highest possible value that can be set to all elements in the array through the described operations.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is 2 correctly.
   - The function also handles the case where `n` is greater than 2 by considering all possible triplets, which is necessary to find the maximum median.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The function is efficient enough for the given constraints, as it only iterates over the array once for each test case, and the sorting of triplets is a constant-time operation.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible value of the number in the array after performing the operations described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
