Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, and for each test case, the total cost of buying `k` tickets has been printed. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` retain their initial values or are reset for each test case, while the variables `L`, `M`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost` are used and modified within the loop but do not persist outside of each test case iteration.**
