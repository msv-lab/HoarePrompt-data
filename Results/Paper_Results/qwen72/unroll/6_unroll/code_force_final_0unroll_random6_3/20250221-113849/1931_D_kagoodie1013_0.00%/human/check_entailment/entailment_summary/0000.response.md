Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array, where a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). However, the program has a logical flaw in the way it counts the pairs.

The function `func_1` uses two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the remainders when elements of the array are divided by \(x\) and \(y\), respectively. For each element in the array, it calculates the potential remainders that would form a beautiful pair with the current element and increments the count based on the values in these dictionaries. However, the current implementation only checks if the sum and difference conditions are satisfied individually, not simultaneously.

To correctly count the beautiful pairs, the program should:
1. For each element \(a_i\), calculate the remainder when \(a_i\) is divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
2. For each element \(a_j\) (where \(j > i\)), check if both conditions \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) and \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) are satisfied.
3. If both conditions are satisfied, increment the count.

The current implementation does not correctly handle the simultaneous conditions required for a pair to be beautiful. It only increments the count if either condition is satisfied, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
