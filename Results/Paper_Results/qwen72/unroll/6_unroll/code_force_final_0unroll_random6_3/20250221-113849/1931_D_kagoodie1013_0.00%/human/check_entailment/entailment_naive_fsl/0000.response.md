Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find beautiful pairs as described in the problem. Specifically, the program is counting pairs where `a_i + a_j` and `a_i - a_j` are divisible by `x` and `y`, respectively, but it is not correctly handling the condition that `i < j`. The current implementation counts pairs where `i` and `j` can be the same, which is not allowed according to the problem statement. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where `a_i - a_j` is negative, as it should still be checked for divisibility by `y`.

For example, consider the test case:
```
n = 4, x = 3, y = 2, arr = [1, 2, 4, 5]
```
The beautiful pairs should be:
- \langle 1, 4 \rangle: \(a_1 + a_4 = 1 + 5 = 6\) (6 is divisible by 3) and \(a_1 - a_4 = 1 - 5 = -4\) (-4 is divisible by 2).

However, the program will incorrectly count pairs where `i` and `j` are the same, and it will not correctly handle the negative difference. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
