Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: a list of integers a (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) of length n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and two integers x and y (1 <= x, y <= 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The initial state of `test_cases` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged state of `test_cases` and the new state of `results` being an empty list.
