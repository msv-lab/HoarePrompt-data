### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Set Initialization**:
   - It initializes a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It also initializes an empty set `win` to keep track of the characters in the current window and a list `ans` to store the last character of each complete set of the first `k` alphabets encountered in `s`.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check if a complete set of the first `k` alphabets is present in the string `s`.
   - For each character `i` in `s`, if `i` is in `us`, it adds `i` to `win`.
   - If `win` contains all `k` alphabets, it appends `i` to `ans`, increments `ps`, and clears `win`.

4. **Output**:
   - If `ps` (the number of times a complete set of the first `k` alphabets was encountered) is greater than or equal to `n`, the program prints 'YES'.
   - If `ps` is less than `n`, the program prints 'NO' and then attempts to print a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

5. **Error in the Loop**:
   - The loop that prints the string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s` is incorrect.
   - The loop iterates over each character in `us` and checks if it is not in `win`. If a character is not in `win`, it prints a string composed of the characters in `ans` concatenated with the current character from `us` and then padded with 'a' characters to reach a total length of `n`.
   - However, this approach does not guarantee that the generated string is not a subsequence of `s`. The program should generate a string that is not a subsequence, but the current logic does not ensure this.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly generate a string that is not a subsequence, the program should consider all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` alphabets and check if any of them are not present in `s` as a subsequence.
   - Alternatively, a simpler approach is to generate a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence by ensuring that it does not match any pattern in `s`. For example, a string like `k * 'a'` (i.e., `n` 'a' characters) can be a good candidate if `s` does not contain `n` consecutive 'a' characters.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly generate a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s` when it prints 'NO'. The logic in the loop is flawed and does not ensure that the generated string is not a subsequence of `s`.
