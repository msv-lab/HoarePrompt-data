The only variable in the loop head is `tickets_bought`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tickets_bought`. If `tickets_bought` is less than `k`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tickets_bought` is 0, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). Since `tickets_bought` is 0, it is already less than `k`, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `pq` is now a heap containing the same elements as before, but they are now organized in a way that allows efficient access to the smallest element. `total_cost` is 0. `tickets_bought` is 0. `price_increase` is 0.**
