t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) representing the number of boxes, a string s of n characters where each character is '0' or '1' representing the initial state of the boxes, and a string f of n characters where each character is '0' or '1' representing the desired state of the boxes. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
