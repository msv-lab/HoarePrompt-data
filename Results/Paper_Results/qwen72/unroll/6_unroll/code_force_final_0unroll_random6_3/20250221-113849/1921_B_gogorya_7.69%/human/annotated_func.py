#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) representing the number of boxes, a string s of n characters where each character is '0' or '1' representing the initial state of the boxes, and a string f of n characters where each character is '0' or '1' representing the desired state of the boxes. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s1 = input()
        
        s2 = input()
        
        a1 = s1.count('1')
        
        a2 = s2.count('1')
        
        hd = a1 - a2
        
        res = abs(a1 - a2)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if hd > 0:
                hd -= 1
                continue
            if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: The loop iterates t times, where t is the number of test cases. For each test case, the output is the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (s1) to the desired state (s2). The operations involve flipping a '1' to a '0' or a '0' to a '1'. The variable `res` holds this minimum number of operations for each test case, and it is printed after each iteration. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` are reset for each test case, and the loop continues until all test cases are processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^5) representing the number of boxes, a string `s1` of `n` characters ('0' or '1') representing the initial state of the boxes, and a string `s2` of `n` characters ('0' or '1') representing the desired state of the boxes. The function calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` into the desired state `s2` for each test case. The operations involve flipping a '1' to a '0' or a '0' to a '1'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
