The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases, and `t` must be greater than 0**
