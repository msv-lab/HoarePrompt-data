#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin where the first line is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines each containing a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct. The function should output the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each string.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive. `ac` and `bc` are both 0. The function `func` has read `t` lines from stdin, each containing a distinct string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive. `ac` and `bc` are both 0. The function `func` has read `t` lines from stdin, each containing a distinct string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. After the if-else block, if `ac` is greater than `bc`, the current value of `ac` remains greater than `bc`. Otherwise, `ac` is not greater than `bc`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a number of test cases `t` from standard input, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 32. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. The function then counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string and prints the most frequent character ('A' or 'B'). If the counts are equal, it prints 'B'. After processing all test cases, the function returns and the final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the most frequent character for each string has been printed.
