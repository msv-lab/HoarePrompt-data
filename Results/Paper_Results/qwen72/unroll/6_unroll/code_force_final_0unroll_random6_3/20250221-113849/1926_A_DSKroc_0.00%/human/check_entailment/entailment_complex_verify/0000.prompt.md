You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0

        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin where the first line is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines each containing a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct. The function should output the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each string.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive. `ac` and `bc` are both 0. The function `func` has read `t` lines from stdin, each containing a distinct string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive. `ac` and `bc` are both 0. The function `func` has read `t` lines from stdin, each containing a distinct string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. After the if-else block, if `ac` is greater than `bc`, the current value of `ac` remains greater than `bc`. Otherwise, `ac` is not greater than `bc`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a number of test cases `t` from standard input, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 32. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. The function then counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string and prints the most frequent character ('A' or 'B'). If the counts are equal, it prints 'B'. After processing all test cases, the function returns and the final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the most frequent character for each string has been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. The `if ac > bc:` and `else:` blocks are outside the loop that processes each test case, which means that the program only prints the result for the last test case. For example, if the input is:

```
3
ABABB
ABABA
BBBAB
```

The program will only print the result for the last string "BBBAB", which is "B", and will not print the results for the first two strings. The correct implementation should print the result for each test case within the loop.
