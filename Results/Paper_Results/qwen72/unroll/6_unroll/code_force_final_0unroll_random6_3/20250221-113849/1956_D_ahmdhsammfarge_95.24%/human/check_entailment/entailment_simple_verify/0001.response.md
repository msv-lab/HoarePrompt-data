### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX value.
   - The MEX of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function aims to find the subarray that, when replaced with its MEX, will maximize the sum of the array.
     - The function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray is replaced with its MEX.
     - However, the MEX calculation is incorrect. The function uses \((j - i + 1)^2\) as a proxy for the MEX, which is not the correct way to compute the MEX. The correct MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
     - The function returns the indices of the subarray that would maximize the sum.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function recursively appends operations to the `ops` list.
     - It is designed to handle the case where the subarray is being replaced with its MEX value.
     - The function is not directly related to the MEX calculation but is used to generate the sequence of operations.
     - The recursive calls and the appending of operations multiple times are unnecessary and could lead to an incorrect sequence of operations.

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
     - This function performs the operation on the subarray and updates the `ops` list.
     - It appends the operation to the `ops` list and then checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0. If so, it appends the operation again.
     - The MEX value is incorrectly set to the length of the subarray, which is not the correct MEX.
     - The function updates the array and returns it.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - **MEX Calculation:**
     - The MEX calculation in `func_1` is incorrect. It should find the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not \((j - i + 1)^2\).
   - **Function 3:**
     - The MEX value is incorrectly set to the length of the subarray, which is not the correct MEX.
     - The function appends operations multiple times, which is not necessary and could lead to an incorrect sequence of operations.
   - **Overall Logic:**
     - The program does not correctly identify the MEX of the subarray and does not follow the correct logic to solve the problem as described.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program does not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray.
   - The operations generated by the program may not achieve the maximum sum of the array.
   - The program does not follow the correct logic to solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray and does not follow the correct logic to maximize the sum of the array. The issues identified in the original assessment are valid and need to be addressed to make the program correct.
