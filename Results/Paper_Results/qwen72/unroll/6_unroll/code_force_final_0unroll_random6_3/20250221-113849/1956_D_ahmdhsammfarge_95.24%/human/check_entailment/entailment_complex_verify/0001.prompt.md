You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):

    return r, l
    #The program returns the values of `r` and `l`, where `r` is the index `i` and `l` is the index `j`. These indices are part of the initial state and are used to calculate `over_sum` as the maximum possible value of `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns two indices `r` and `l`. These indices are chosen such that the value of `sum(lst[:r]) + sum(lst[l + 1:]) + (l - r + 1)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are integers such that 1 <= r <= l <= n, and ops is a list that can store pairs of integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two integers `r` and `l` within the range 1 to n, and a list `ops` that can store pairs of integers. It modifies the `ops` list by appending pairs of integers `[r + 1, l + 1]` in a recursive manner. The function does not return any value, but the final state of the `ops` list will contain multiple pairs of integers, each representing a modified version of the input `r` and `l` incremented by 1. The exact number of pairs and their values depend on the initial values of `r` and `l`.

#Function 3:

If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the function performs the operation specified in the if part.

    #The program returns the list `lst` where the elements from index `r` to index `l` (inclusive) are all set to the value `n`, and `n` is equal to `l - r + 1`. The rest of the elements in `lst` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It modifies the list `ops` by appending several operations, and it returns the list `lst` with the elements from index `r` to index `l` (inclusive) set to the value `n`, where `n` is `l - r + 1`. The rest of the elements in `lst` remain unchanged. The function also ensures that if the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, an additional operation is appended to `ops`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements of the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function aims to find the subarray that, when replaced with its MEX, will maximize the sum of the array.
     - It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray is replaced with its MEX.
     - The MEX of a subarray is approximated by \((j - i + 1)^2\), which is incorrect. The correct MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
     - The function returns the indices of the subarray that would maximize the sum.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function recursively appends operations to the `ops` list.
     - It is designed to handle the case where the subarray is being replaced with its MEX value.
     - The function is not directly related to the MEX calculation but is used to generate the sequence of operations.

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
     - This function performs the operation on the subarray and updates the `ops` list.
     - It appends the operation to the `ops` list and then checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0. If so, it appends the operation again.
     - It then sets the subarray to the MEX value, which is incorrectly calculated as \(n\) (the length of the subarray).
     - The function updates the array and returns it.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - **MEX Calculation:**
     - The MEX calculation in `func_1` is incorrect. It should find the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not \((j - i + 1)^2\).
   - **Function 3:**
     - The MEX value is incorrectly set to the length of the subarray, which is not the correct MEX.
     - The function appends operations multiple times, which is not necessary and could lead to an incorrect sequence of operations.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program does not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray.
   - The operations generated by the program may not achieve the maximum sum of the array.
   - The program does not follow the correct logic to solve the problem as described.
