Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements in an array by performing operations that replace a subarray with the MEX of that subarray. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray. The operations should be performed no more than 500,000 times.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function is supposed to find the optimal indices `r` and `l` for the next operation that maximizes the sum of the array. It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential sum if the subarray from `i` to `j` is replaced with the MEX of that subarray. It updates `r` and `l` with the indices that give the highest potential sum.
   - **func_2**: This function is intended to append operations to the `ops` list. However, it seems to be incorrectly implemented. It recursively appends the same operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times, which is not necessary and does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - **func_3**: This function performs the operation on the subarray from `r` to `l`. It appends the operation to `ops` and sets the subarray to the MEX value, which is `l - r + 1` (the length of the subarray). It also includes additional operations that are not clearly justified by the problem statement.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic repeatedly calls `func_1` to find the optimal subarray and then `func_3` to perform the operation. This process continues until no more optimal subarrays can be found (`r == l`).
   - After the main loop, it tries to replace any remaining zeros in the array with ones, which is a valid operation to maximize the sum.

4. **Issues**:
   - **func_2**: This function is not necessary for the problem and introduces redundant operations. It should be removed or corrected to only append the necessary operations.
   - **func_3**: The function appends multiple operations, some of which are redundant. For example, the line `ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])` and the recursive call to `func_2` are not needed. The function should simply append the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` once and set the subarray to the MEX value.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The main logic is generally correct in terms of finding and applying the optimal operations.
   - However, the presence of `func_2` and the redundant operations in `func_3` make the program incorrect because it does not efficiently or correctly construct the sequence of operations.

Given the issues with `func_2` and `func_3`, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
