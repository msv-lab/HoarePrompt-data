Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - The function attempts to find the optimal segment `[i, j]` to maximize the sum of the array after applying the MEX operation.
   - However, the function incorrectly calculates the potential sum after the operation. The MEX of a segment is not necessarily `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is what the function uses. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the segment.
   - The function also does not correctly handle the case where the segment `[i, j]` is chosen. It updates `r` and `l` but does not actually apply the MEX operation to the segment.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function is supposed to recursively add operations to the list `ops` to transform the segment `[r, l]`.
   - The function incorrectly handles the case where `r == l`. It should not add the same operation twice.
   - The function also does not correctly handle the recursive calls. It should not call itself with the same segment twice.

3. **Function 3 (func_3):**
   - This function attempts to apply the MEX operation to the segment `[r, l]` and update the list of operations.
   - The function incorrectly adds the same operation multiple times, which is not necessary.
   - The function also does not correctly handle the MEX calculation. It sets the segment to `[n for _ in range(n)]` where `n` is the length of the segment, but this is not the correct MEX value.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. Identify the segment `[l, r]` that maximizes the sum after applying the MEX operation.
2. Calculate the MEX of the segment correctly.
3. Apply the MEX operation to the segment and update the array.
4. Repeat the process until no more operations can increase the sum.

The provided functions do not correctly implement these steps, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
