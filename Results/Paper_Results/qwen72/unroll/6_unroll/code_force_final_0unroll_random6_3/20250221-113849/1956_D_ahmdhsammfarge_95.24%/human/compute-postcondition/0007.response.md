Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the parameters of an operation, and the last three elements of `ops` are `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `[r + 1, l + 1]`, and `[r + 1, r + 1]`. `n` is equal to `l - r + 1`.** 

Explanation: The value of `n` is calculated as `l - r + 1`, where `l` and `r` are non-negative integers with `0 <= r <= l < len(lst)`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
