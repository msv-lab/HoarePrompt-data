### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing operations that involve selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements of the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - The operations should be performed no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function aims to find the subarray that, when replaced with its MEX, will maximize the sum of the array.
     - It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray is replaced with its MEX.
     - However, the MEX calculation is incorrect. The function uses \((j - i + 1)^2\) as an approximation for the MEX, which is not the correct way to compute the MEX. The correct MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
     - The function returns the indices of the subarray that would maximize the sum.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function recursively appends operations to the `ops` list.
     - It is designed to handle the case where the subarray is being replaced with its MEX value.
     - The function is not directly related to the MEX calculation but is used to generate the sequence of operations.
     - The function appends the same operation multiple times, which is not necessary and could lead to an incorrect sequence of operations.

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
     - This function performs the operation on the subarray and updates the `ops` list.
     - It appends the operation to the `ops` list and then checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0. If so, it appends the operation again.
     - It then sets the subarray to the MEX value, which is incorrectly calculated as \(n\) (the length of the subarray).
     - The function updates the array and returns it.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - **MEX Calculation:**
     - The MEX calculation in `func_1` is incorrect. It should find the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not \((j - i + 1)^2\).
     - The MEX value in `func_3` is also incorrectly set to the length of the subarray, which is not the correct MEX.
   - **Function 3:**
     - The function appends operations multiple times, which is not necessary and could lead to an incorrect sequence of operations.
     - The function also sets the subarray to the length of the subarray, which is incorrect and does not maximize the sum as intended.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program does not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray.
   - The operations generated by the program may not achieve the maximum sum of the array.
   - The program does not follow the correct logic to solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program contains significant logical errors in the MEX calculation and the sequence of operations, which prevent it from correctly solving the problem. The MEX should be calculated as the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, and the operations should be generated and applied correctly to maximize the sum of the array.
