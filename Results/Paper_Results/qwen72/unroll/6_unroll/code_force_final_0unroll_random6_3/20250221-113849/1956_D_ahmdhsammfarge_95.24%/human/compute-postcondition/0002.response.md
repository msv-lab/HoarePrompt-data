The code appends the list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. The values of `lst`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged. The new `ops` list now includes the additional sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the parameters of an operation, and the last element of `ops` is `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0.**
