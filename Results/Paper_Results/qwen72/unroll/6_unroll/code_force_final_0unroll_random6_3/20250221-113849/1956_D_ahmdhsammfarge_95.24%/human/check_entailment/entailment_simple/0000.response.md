### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array by performing a series of operations where the MEX of a subarray is computed and all elements in that subarray are set to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - The operations should be performed no more than 500,000 times.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function is supposed to find the subarray that, when replaced with its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
     - The function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray is replaced with its MEX.
     - It returns the indices of the subarray that maximizes this potential sum.
     - However, the function does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray. It simply calculates the sum of the array excluding the subarray and adds the square of the subarray length, which is not the correct way to compute the MEX.
     - The function also returns `r` and `l` in the wrong order (it should return `l` and `r`).

   - **func_2**: This function is supposed to append operations to the `ops` list.
     - The function recursively appends operations, but it does not correctly handle the base case or the recursive calls.
     - The function appends the same operation multiple times, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

   - **func_3**: This function performs the operation on the subarray and updates the `ops` list.
     - The function appends operations to the `ops` list, but it does so in a way that is not aligned with the problem's requirements.
     - It sets the subarray to the length of the subarray, which is not the MEX of the subarray.
     - The function also appends the same operation multiple times, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

3. **Main Program**:
   - The main program initializes the list `lst` and the operations list `ops`.
   - It calls `func_1` to find the optimal subarray and then repeatedly calls `func_3` to perform the operation on the subarray.
   - After the loop, it tries to replace all zeros in the array with ones, which is a correct step but not the optimal way to maximize the sum.
   - The program prints the final sum and the operations list.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because:
- `func_1` does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray.
- `func_2` and `func_3` do not correctly handle the operations and subarray updates.
- The main program does not follow the correct logic to maximize the sum of the array.

### Correctness:
**False**
