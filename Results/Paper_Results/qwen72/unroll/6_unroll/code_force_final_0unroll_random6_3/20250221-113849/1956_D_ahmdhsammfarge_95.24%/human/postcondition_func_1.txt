The function `func_2` accepts two integers `r` and `l` within the range 1 to n, and a list `ops` that can store pairs of integers. It modifies the `ops` list by appending pairs of integers `[r + 1, l + 1]` in a recursive manner. The function does not return any value, but the final state of the `ops` list will contain multiple pairs of integers, each representing a modified version of the input `r` and `l` incremented by 1. The exact number of pairs and their values depend on the initial values of `r` and `l`.
