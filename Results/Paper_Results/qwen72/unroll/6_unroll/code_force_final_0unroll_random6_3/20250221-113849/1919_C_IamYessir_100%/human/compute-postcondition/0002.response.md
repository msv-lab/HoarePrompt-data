The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the size of an array `a`, and the array `a` itself, which contains `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. The function returns the results for each test case based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It returns the results for each test case, where the results are based on the values in the array `a` and the size `n`.**
