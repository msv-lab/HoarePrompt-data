### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to split the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the total penalty `p(s) + p(t)` is minimized.
   - The penalty `p(b)` for an array `b` is defined as the number of indices `i` (1 â‰¤ i < m) where `b_i < b_{i+1}`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program iterates through the array `a` and decides whether to append each element to `a` or `b` based on the current last elements of `a` and `b`.
   - The conditions for appending to `a` or `b` are:
     - If `a` is empty, `x` is set to infinity.
     - If `b` is empty, `y` is set to infinity.
     - If `x > y`:
       - If `y >= lit[i]`, append `lit[i]` to `b`.
       - If `lit[i] > x`, append `lit[i]` to `b`.
       - If `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, append `lit[i]` to `a`.
     - If `x == y`, append `lit[i]` to `a`.
     - If `x < y`:
       - If `x >= lit[i]`, append `lit[i]` to `a`.
       - If `lit[i] > y`, append `lit[i]` to `a`.
       - If `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, append `lit[i]` to `b`.

3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - After constructing the subsequences `a` and `b`, the program calculates the penalty for each subsequence.
   - The penalty for a subsequence is the number of increasing pairs of consecutive elements.
   - The total penalty is the sum of the penalties of `a` and `b`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `a` or `b` is empty by setting `x` or `y` to infinity, which ensures that the comparison logic works correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where the array `a` has only one element by correctly outputting 0 (since there are no pairs to compare).

5. **Optimality**:
   - The logic for appending elements to `a` or `b` is indeed overly complex and may not always lead to the optimal solution.
   - Specifically, the conditions `if y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x` are redundant and can lead to incorrect decisions.
   - A simpler and more optimal approach would be to always append the current element to the subsequence where it would not create an increasing pair. This can be achieved by maintaining two pointers to the last elements of `a` and `b` and appending the current element to the subsequence where it would not increase the penalty.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the program might split the array in a way that does not minimize the penalty. For example, it might split it as `a = [2, 4, 5]` and `b = [1, 3]`, resulting in a penalty of 3, which is correct.
   - For the input `a = [8, 2, 3, 1, 1, 7, 4, 3]`, the program might split it as `a = [8, 3, 1]` and `b = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3]`, resulting in a penalty of 1, which is correct.
   - For the input `a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, the program splits it as `a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` and `b = []`, resulting in a penalty of 0, which is correct.
   - For the input `a = [1]`, the program correctly outputs 0 since there are no pairs to compare.
   - For the input `a = [2, 1]`, the program correctly outputs 0 since there are no increasing pairs.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - While the program produces correct results for the given examples, the logic for appending elements to `a` or `b` is flawed and may not always lead to the optimal solution.
   - The conditions are overly complex and can be simplified to ensure the correct and optimal behavior.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The given program is incorrect due to the overly complex and potentially flawed conditions for appending elements to `a` or `b`. A simpler and more optimal approach is needed to ensure the correct minimum penalty is always calculated.
