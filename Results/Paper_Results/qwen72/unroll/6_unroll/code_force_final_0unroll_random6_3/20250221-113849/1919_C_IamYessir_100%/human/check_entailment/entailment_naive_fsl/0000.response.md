Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input array is already in non-increasing order, which should result in a penalty of 0. However, the current logic in the program might still add elements to either `a` or `b`, leading to a non-zero penalty. For example, consider the input array `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`. The program should output 0, but it might not due to the way elements are being appended to `a` and `b`. 

Additionally, the logic for appending elements to `a` and `b` is overly complex and does not guarantee that the penalty is minimized. The program should aim to minimize the number of increasing pairs in both subsequences, but the current logic does not effectively achieve this. For instance, with the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the program might not split the array optimally to achieve the minimum penalty of 3.
