The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it distributes the elements of `a` into two lists, `a` and `b`, based on specific conditions. It then calculates the number of increasing pairs in both lists and prints this number. The lists `a` and `b` are reset to empty for each new test case, and the variable `s`, which counts the increasing pairs, is reset to 0 for each test case. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results.
