The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`. For the loop to execute, the number of test cases `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly adjusted, but it will be assigned the values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop execution.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
