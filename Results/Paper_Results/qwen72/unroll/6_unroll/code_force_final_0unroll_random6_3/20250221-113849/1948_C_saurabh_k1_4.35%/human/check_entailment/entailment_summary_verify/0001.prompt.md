You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. It then checks if the second-to-last character in the string `b` is '<'. If it is, the function prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are reset for each test case, and their values are not retained between iterations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and must reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot moves in two steps each second: first, it moves left, right, down, or up; then it follows the arrow in the current cell.
   - The grid is 2 rows by n columns, and each cell contains an arrow pointing either left (<) or right (>).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The robot must eventually move to the second row to reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot can only move to the second row by moving down from the first row.
   - Once in the second row, the robot must move right to reach the end column n.

3. **Critical Condition**:
   - The robot can only reach cell (2, n) if it can move to the second row and then move right to the end.
   - Specifically, the robot must be able to move to the second row at some column \( i \) where \( 1 \le i < n \).
   - If the robot moves to the second row and finds an arrow pointing left (<) at column \( n-1 \), it will be unable to move to column \( n \).

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size \( n \), the first row \( a \), and the second row \( b \).
   - The program checks if the arrow at column \( n-1 \) in the second row \( b \) is pointing left (<).
   - If it is, the program prints "No" because the robot cannot move to column \( n \) from column \( n-1 \).
   - If it is not, the program prints "Yes" because the robot can move to column \( n \) from column \( n-1 \).

5. **Edge Cases and General Validity**:
   - The program assumes that \( n \) is even and that the sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \), as per the problem constraints.
   - The program does not check if the robot can actually move to the second row from the first row. However, the problem guarantees that the robot can always move to the second row at some point, so this is not a concern.
   - The program correctly identifies that if the arrow at \( b[n-2] \) is "<", the robot cannot reach \( (2, n) \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies whether the robot can reach cell (2, n) based on the critical condition. Therefore, the program is correct.
