Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same. In such a case, it is impossible to distribute the coins in a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. For example, consider the input:

```
2
3
5 5 5
```

The program will calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, which is 5, and then distribute the coins as \( 5 // 5 = 1 \) for each outcome. The total sum of bets will be \( 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \), and the amount received back for any winning outcome will be \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \). Since 3 is not strictly less than 5, the program should output \(-1\), but it does not. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
