The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `bets` and a list of integers `a` from the input. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`, then modifies each element in `a` to be the result of `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the LCM. It sums the modified elements in `a` to get `sumo`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints a space-separated string of the modified elements in `a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.
