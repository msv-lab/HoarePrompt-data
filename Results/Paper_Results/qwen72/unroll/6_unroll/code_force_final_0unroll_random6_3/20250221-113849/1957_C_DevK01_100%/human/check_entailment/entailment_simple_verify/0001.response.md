### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to determine the remaining valid positions for rooks.

2. **Processing Moves**:
   - The program correctly checks if `a` is not equal to `b` for each move `(a, b)`.
   - If `a != b`, it reduces `n` by 2 because both the row `a` and column `b` are occupied by a white rook, and the computer's mirrored move occupies the row `b` and column `a`.
   - If `a == b`, it reduces `n` by 1 because only one row and one column are occupied.
   - This logic is accurate and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Dynamic Programming Function**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to calculate the number of different final configurations.
   - The `dp` array is initialized with `[1, 1]` to handle the base cases:
     - `dp[0] = 1` (0 rooks can be placed in 1 way: do nothing).
     - `dp[1] = 1` (1 rook can be placed in 1 way: place it in the only available position).
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, it updates the `dp` array using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the fact that:
     - `dp[i-1]` represents the number of ways to place `i-1` rooks.
     - `2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` represents the number of ways to place the `i`-th rook in a new row and column, considering the previous configurations.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of different final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Annotations Validation:
- **State of the program right before the function call**:
  - `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and it is guaranteed that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
  - This is correct as the program has already processed the moves and updated `n` accordingly.

- **State of the program within the function**:
  - `dp` is a list with two elements, where the first element is the last computed value of the sequence and the second element is the second last computed value of the sequence.
  - The length of the list remains 2, and the program correctly updates and shifts the values in the `dp` list.
  - This is accurate and ensures that the dynamic programming approach is efficient in terms of space.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the input, processes the moves, and uses dynamic programming to compute the number of valid final configurations. The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
