### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Assessment of the Problem Description and the Program:**
   - The problem requires calculating the number of possible final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves, where each move is mirrored by the computer.
   - The program reads the number of test cases, the size of the chessboard, and the number of moves already made. It then processes each move to reduce the size of the board based on the moves.
   - The function `func_1` is used to compute the number of possible configurations for the remaining board size.

2. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.
     - It processes each move and reduces the board size `n` accordingly:
       - If the move is on a diagonal (i.e., `a == b`), it reduces `n` by 1.
       - If the move is not on a diagonal, it reduces `n` by 2.
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to compute the number of possible configurations for a given board size `n`.
     - The dynamic programming list `dp` is initialized with `[1, 1]`, which represents the number of configurations for board sizes 0 and 1.
     - The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the `dp` list with the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`.
     - The `dp.pop(0)` ensures that the list `dp` always contains the last two computed values.

3. **Edge Case Analysis:**
   - **Case `n = 1` and `k = 0`:**
     - According to the problem, if `n` is 1 and `k` is 0, the board is already in its final configuration with no rooks placed.
     - The program correctly returns 1 for this case because:
       - `n` starts as 1.
       - No moves are made (`k = 0`), so `n` remains 1.
       - `func_1(1)` returns 1, which is the correct number of configurations for a 1x1 board with no rooks.

4. **General Case Analysis:**
   - The program correctly reduces the board size based on the moves made.
   - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is appropriate for calculating the number of configurations for the remaining board size.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required range.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment incorrectly states that the program does not handle the edge case where `n = 1` and `k = 0` correctly. However, the program does handle this case correctly.
   - The program's logic for processing moves and computing the number of configurations is sound and aligns with the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and handles all cases, including the edge case where `n = 1` and `k = 0`, as required by the problem description.
