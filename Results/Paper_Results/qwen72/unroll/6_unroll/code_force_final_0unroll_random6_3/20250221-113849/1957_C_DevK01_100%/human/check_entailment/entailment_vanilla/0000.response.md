### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to determine the remaining valid positions for rooks.

2. **Processing Moves**:
   - For each move `(a, b)`, the program checks if `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - If `a != b`, it reduces `n` by 2 because both the row `a` and column `b` are occupied by a white rook, and the computer's mirrored move occupies the row `b` and column `a`.
   - If `a == b`, it reduces `n` by 1 because only one row and one column are occupied.

3. **Dynamic Programming Function**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to calculate the number of different final configurations.
   - It uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on the remaining `n` positions.
   - The `dp` array is initialized with `[1, 1]` to handle the base cases.
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, it updates the `dp` array using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the current configuration, considering the previous configurations.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of different final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Analysis:
- The program correctly processes the input and updates the board size `n` based on the moves made.
- The dynamic programming function `func_1(n)` is correctly implemented to calculate the number of valid configurations.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the input, processes the moves, and uses dynamic programming to compute the number of valid final configurations.
