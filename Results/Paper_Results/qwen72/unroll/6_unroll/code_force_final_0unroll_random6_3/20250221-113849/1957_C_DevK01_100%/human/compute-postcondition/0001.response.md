The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 2 because the range starts from 2 and goes up to `n + 1`. Since `n` is already guaranteed to be a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 2, which is the first value it will take in the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and it is guaranteed that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `dp` is a list with two elements, both set to 1; `i` is 2**
