Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.

2. **Move Processing**: For each of the `k` moves, the program checks if the move is on the diagonal (i.e., `a == b`). If it is, it reduces `n` by 1 (since only one rook is placed on the board). If it is not on the diagonal, it reduces `n` by 2 (since both a white and a black rook are placed on the board).

3. **Dynamic Programming for Final Configurations**: The function `func_1(n)` calculates the number of possible final configurations using dynamic programming. The recurrence relation used is:
   \[
   \text{dp}[i] = \text{dp}[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot \text{dp}[i-2]
   \]
   This relation accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on an `i x i` board, considering the constraints of the problem. The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The program correctly implements the logic to handle the given constraints and problem requirements, making it a valid solution.
