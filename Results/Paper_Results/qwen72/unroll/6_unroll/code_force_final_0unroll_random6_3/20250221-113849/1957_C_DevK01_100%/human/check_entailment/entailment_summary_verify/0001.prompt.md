You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    90 91

Output

    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (n, k) = (L[0], L[1])
    for j in range(k):
        L1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (a, b) = (L1[0], L1[1])
        if a != b:
            n -= 2
        else:
            n -= 1
    print(func_1(n))
    continue

def func_1(n):
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
        dp.pop(0)
    return dp[-1]



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the size of a chessboard. It computes a sequence of values based on a specific formula and returns the last computed value of this sequence. The sequence is calculated using dynamic programming, and the function ensures that only the last two computed values are stored in the list `dp` at any point. After the function concludes, the list `dp` contains the last two values of the sequence, but only the last computed value (the first element of `dp`) is returned.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to determine the remaining valid positions for rooks.

2. **Processing Moves**:
   - For each move `(a, b)`, the program checks if `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - If `a != b`, it reduces `n` by 2 because both the row `a` and column `b` are occupied by a white rook, and the computer's mirrored move occupies the row `b` and column `a`.
   - If `a == b`, it reduces `n` by 1 because only one row and one column are occupied.

3. **Dynamic Programming Function**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to calculate the number of different final configurations.
   - It uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on the remaining `n` positions.
   - The `dp` array is initialized with `[1, 1]` to handle the base cases.
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, it updates the `dp` array using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the current configuration, considering the previous configurations.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of different final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Analysis:
- The program correctly processes the input and updates the board size `n` based on the moves made.
- The dynamic programming function `func_1(n)` is correctly implemented to calculate the number of valid configurations.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the input, processes the moves, and uses dynamic programming to compute the number of valid final configurations.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
