You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array a, and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array a. The total number of test cases t is given, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and it is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
        t = 0
        
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop prints the smallest index i such that the element a[i] appears exactly once in the array a, or the smallest index i such that the element i is not present in the array a, and then breaks out of the loop. The values of `tc`, `N`, `a`, `cnt`, and `t` are updated for each test case, but their final states are not predictable without the specific input values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints the smallest index `i` such that the element `a[i]` appears exactly once in the array `a`, or the smallest index `i` such that the element `i` is not present in the array `a`, and then breaks out of the loop. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The values of `tc`, `N`, `a`, `cnt`, and `t` are updated for each test case, but their final states are not predictable without the specific input values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns removing elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the element she picks to an array `c` and then removes it from `a`.
   - Bob removes the element he picks from `a` without appending it to `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score of the game is the MEX of `c`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the score, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - We need to determine the final score if both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice should always pick the smallest element that appears exactly once in `a` to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob should always pick the smallest element that appears exactly once in `a` to minimize the MEX of `c`.
   - If there are no elements that appear exactly once, both players will pick the smallest available element to influence the MEX.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It iterates through the elements from 0 to `N-1` and checks if the count of the current element is 1.
   - If the count of the current element is 1, it increments a counter `t`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or the count of the current element is 0, it prints the current element and breaks the loop.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It correctly identifies the smallest element that appears exactly once.
   - However, the logic for breaking the loop is flawed. The program should break the loop when it finds the first element that appears exactly once, not when `t` reaches 2.
   - The condition `if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0` is incorrect because it does not ensure that the MEX is correctly calculated.

5. **Correct Logic:**
   - The correct logic should be to find the smallest element that appears exactly once and append it to `c` if it is Alice's turn.
   - If it is Bob's turn, he should remove the smallest element that appears exactly once.
   - The game should continue until all elements are removed from `a`.
   - The final MEX of `c` should be the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in `c`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players.
   - The condition for breaking the loop is incorrect, leading to potential incorrect MEX values.
