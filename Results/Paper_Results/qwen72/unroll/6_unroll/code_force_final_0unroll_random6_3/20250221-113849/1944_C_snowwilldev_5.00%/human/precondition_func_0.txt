The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array a, and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array a. The total number of test cases t is given, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and it is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
