The function `func` is designed to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array `a`, and `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array `a`. The total number of test cases `t` is given, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and it is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints and relationships. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one. The total number of test cases `t` is provided, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
