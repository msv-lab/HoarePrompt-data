### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Elements**:
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`. This is a correct approach to keep track of how many times each element appears.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c`.
   - Alice and Bob play optimally, and the key to solving this problem is to understand their optimal moves:
     - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she will try to avoid including the smallest missing integer in `c`.
     - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he will try to include the smallest missing integer in `c` as soon as possible.

4. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates through the integers from 0 to `N-1` and checks the count of each integer in the array `a`.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once in `a`, it is counted (`t += 1`).
   - The loop breaks and prints `i` if either:
     - The integer `i` does not appear in `a` (`cnt[i] == 0`), which means `i` is the MEX.
     - Two integers have appeared exactly once (`t >= 2`), which means Alice and Bob will both pick these integers, and the MEX will be the next smallest integer that is not in `c`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the smallest integer `i` that meets the conditions described above for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic of the program is based on the idea that if an integer `i` appears exactly once, it will be included in `c` by either Alice or Bob. If two such integers appear, the MEX will be the next smallest integer.
- The program correctly identifies the MEX by checking the presence and count of each integer in the array `a`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, given that both players play optimally. The conditions and the loop logic are correctly designed to achieve this.

### Correctness:
**True**
