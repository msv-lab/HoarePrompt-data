Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem by counting the number of duplicate card values in the player's hand. However, this approach is not correct for the given problem. The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, considering that Nene will also play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

The logic in the program `func` is flawed because it simply counts the number of duplicates in your hand, which does not account for the strategic aspect of the game. Specifically, the program does not consider the following key points:

1. **Optimal Play by Nene**: Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. This means that if you play a card with a value that Nene also has, she will play her card with the same value immediately after you to score a point. The program does not simulate this behavior.

2. **Maximizing Your Score**: To maximize your score, you need to play cards in a way that minimizes the number of points Nene can score. This involves a more complex strategy than just counting duplicates.

3. **Turn Sequence**: The turn sequence is important. You and Nene take turns alternately, and the order in which you play your cards can affect the final score.

Given these considerations, the program does not correctly solve the problem. It only counts the number of duplicates in your hand, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of points you can get.

Correctness: **False**
