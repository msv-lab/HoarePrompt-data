The function `func` should accept parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` represents the number of test cases, `n` represents the number of cards each player receives, and `a` is a list of integers representing the cards in your hand. The parameters should satisfy the following constraints: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice in `a`.

The function should return a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function should determine if it is possible to distribute the cards such that each player receives exactly `n` cards, and no two players have the same set of cards.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t` (number of test cases), `n` (number of cards each player receives), and `a` (list of integers representing the cards in your hand). It returns a list of results, where each result indicates whether it is possible to distribute the cards such that each player receives exactly `n` cards, and no two players have the same set of cards.**
