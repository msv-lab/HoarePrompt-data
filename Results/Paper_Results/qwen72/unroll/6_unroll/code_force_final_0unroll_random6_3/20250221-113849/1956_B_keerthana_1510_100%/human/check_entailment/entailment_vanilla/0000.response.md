Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads from `open(0)`, which is a shorthand for reading from standard input (stdin). It takes every second line starting from the third line, which corresponds to the lines containing the card numbers in the player's hand for each test case.

2. **Card Counting**: The program then splits each line into tokens (card numbers) and calculates the difference between the total number of cards (`len(tokens)`) and the number of unique cards (`len({*tokens})`). This difference represents the number of duplicate cards in the player's hand.

3. **Scoring Logic**: The logic behind the scoring is based on the fact that for each duplicate card in the player's hand, the player can score a point when playing the second card of that number, assuming Nene does not play the same card before the player does. This is because the first time a card with a particular number is played, no points are scored, but the second time, a point is scored if the same number is already on the table.

4. **Optimal Play**: The program assumes that the player will always play optimally, which means the player will try to maximize their points by playing the second card of a duplicate as soon as possible. However, the program does not explicitly consider Nene's optimal play, which is to maximize her score and minimize the player's score. Despite this, the program's logic is correct because the number of points the player can score is determined by the number of duplicates in their hand, and Nene's optimal play does not change this fact.

5. **Output**: The program prints the number of points the player can score for each test case, which is the number of duplicates in the player's hand.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of points the player can score by taking their turns optimally, considering Nene's optimal play.

Correctness: **True**
