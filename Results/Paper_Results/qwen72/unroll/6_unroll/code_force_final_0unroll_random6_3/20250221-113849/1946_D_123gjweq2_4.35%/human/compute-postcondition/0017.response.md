The function `find_max` accepts two parameters: `cur_arr` and `bit`. `cur_arr` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 0 to 2^30 - 1. `bit` is an integer in the range 0 to 29. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: If the function is called with the initial parameters, it returns the number of integers in the list `cur_arr`.
- **Case_2**: If the function is called recursively with `bit` decremented by 1, it returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of a new list `new_arr`.
- **Case_3**: If the function is called recursively with `bit` decremented by 1 and a new list `new_arr`, it returns -1 if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, otherwise it returns the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit`. It returns the number of integers in `cur_arr` if called initially. If called recursively, it returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`, or -1 if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, otherwise it returns the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.**
