Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given three digits form a "STAIR," "PEAK," or "NONE" based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `q`. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a "STAIR."
   - It checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a "PEAK."
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE."

3. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for valid inputs.
