Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem description.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that iterates `q` times, which is correct for handling multiple test cases.
3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This is appropriate as the input format specifies that the digits are space-separated.
4. **Conditional Checks**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correctly implemented.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correctly implemented.
   - If neither condition is satisfied, the program prints "NONE". This is the correct fallback for the given problem.
5. **Output**: The program prints the appropriate string ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE") for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles the input and output as required.

Correctness: **True**
