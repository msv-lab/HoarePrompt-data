Reasoning:  
The program `func` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases, `q`, and for each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then checks the conditions for a "stair" (`a < b < c`) and a "peak" (`a < b > c`). If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE". The logic and the conditions are implemented correctly, and the program handles all the given test cases as expected.

The execution summary confirms that the program reads the inputs correctly and prints the appropriate output based on the conditions specified. There are no issues with the input handling or the conditional checks, and the program does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
