### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n`, where `n` is between 3 and 78.
   - The alphabet positions range from 1 to 26, with 'a' being 1 and 'z' being 26.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution uses a series of conditional checks to determine the lexicographically smallest word based on the value of `n`.

3. **Breaking Down the Conditions:**
   - **If `n > 52`:**
     - The maximum sum of positions for a 3-letter word is 78 (26 + 26 + 26).
     - If `n` is greater than 52, the word must include at least one 'z' (26) to minimize the lexicographical order.
     - The solution adds the letter corresponding to `n - 53` (since 'z' is 26, and we need to account for the remaining sum) followed by 'zz'.
     - This ensures that the first letter is the smallest possible while still allowing the sum to reach `n`.
     - **Example:**
       - For `n = 53`, the word is 'azz' (1 + 26 + 26).
       - For `n = 54`, the word is 'bzz' (2 + 26 + 26).
       - This logic is correct.

   - **If `n > 27`:**
     - If `n` is between 28 and 52, the word must include at least one 'z' to minimize the lexicographical order.
     - The solution adds 'a' (1) as the first letter, the letter corresponding to `n - 28` as the second letter, and 'z' (26) as the third letter.
     - This ensures that the first letter is 'a' (the smallest possible), and the second letter is the smallest possible while still allowing the sum to reach `n`.
     - **Example:**
       - For `n = 28`, the word is 'aaz' (1 + 1 + 26).
       - For `n = 52`, the word is 'azz' (1 + 25 + 26).
       - This logic is correct.

   - **If `n == 27`:**
     - The only combination that sums to 27 is 'aay' (1 + 1 + 25).
     - The solution correctly handles this special case.
     - **Example:**
       - For `n = 27`, the word is 'aay' (1 + 1 + 25).
       - This logic is correct.

   - **If `n <= 26`:**
     - The word can be formed by using 'a' (1) as the first two letters and the letter corresponding to `n - 3` as the third letter.
     - This ensures that the first two letters are 'a' (the smallest possible), and the third letter is the smallest possible while still allowing the sum to reach `n`.
     - **Example:**
       - For `n = 3`, the word is 'aaa' (1 + 1 + 1).
       - For `n = 26`, the word is 'aay' (1 + 1 + 24).
       - This logic is correct.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the edge cases correctly:
     - For `n = 3`, the word is 'aaa' (1 + 1 + 1).
     - For `n = 27`, the word is 'aay' (1 + 1 + 25).
     - For `n = 55`, the word is 'czz' (3 + 26 + 26).
     - For `n = 78`, the word is 'zzz' (26 + 26 + 26).

5. **General Case:**
   - The solution correctly generates the lexicographically smallest word for any valid `n` within the range 3 to 78.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly determines the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to the given integer `n` for all valid inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
