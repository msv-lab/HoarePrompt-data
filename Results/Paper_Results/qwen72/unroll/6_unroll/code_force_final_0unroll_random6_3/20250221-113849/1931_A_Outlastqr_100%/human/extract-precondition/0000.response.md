Precondition: **The function should take an integer t as input, where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it should take an integer n, where 3 <= n <= 78, representing the encoded word.**

However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters. To align with the problem description, the function definition should be updated to include parameters for the number of test cases and the encoded word. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def find_smallest_word(t, n_values):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and n_values is a list of integers where each integer n satisfies 3 <= n <= 78.**
