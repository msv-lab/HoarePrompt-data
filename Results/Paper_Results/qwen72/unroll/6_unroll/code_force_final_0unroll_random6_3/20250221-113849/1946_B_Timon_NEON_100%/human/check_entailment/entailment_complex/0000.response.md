Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an integer `number` and returns the result of `number % 1000000007`.
   - This is correct for ensuring that the final answer is within the required modulo.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in `arr`.
   - However, the function has several issues:
     - The `new_segment` and `max_segment` lists are initialized incorrectly. `new_segment` should be a list with a sum and start index, but it is initialized as an empty list.
     - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `segments_variants` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the array contains all negative numbers.
     - The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` even if they are empty or invalid.
     - The final selection of `total_max_segment` is incorrect. It should select the segment with the highest sum, not necessarily the smallest starting index.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic calculates the answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - This formula assumes that `max_segment[0]` is the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray. However, due to the issues in `func_2`, `max_segment[0]` may not be the correct value.
   - The program also handles the case where `max_segment[0]` is -1 by setting it to 0, which is a reasonable fallback.

Given the issues in `func_2`, the program is not correctly identifying the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, which is crucial for the main logic to work correctly.

Correctness: **False**
