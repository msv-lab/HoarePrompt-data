### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final answer should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1(number):** This function correctly returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It is a straightforward and correct implementation for the modulo operation.
   - **func_2(arr):** This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices. However, there are several issues:
     - **Initialization and Usage of `new_segment` and `max_segment`:** `new_segment` is used inconsistently. It is sometimes a list with two elements and sometimes an empty list. This inconsistency can lead to errors.
     - **Logic for Updating `max_segment` and `new_segment`:** The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the array has negative numbers, and it can lead to incorrect results.
     - **Appending to `segments_variants`:** The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` multiple times, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
     - **Final Loop to Find Maximum Segment:** The final loop to find the maximum segment is also flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where `total_max_segment` is initialized to \([-1]\), and it may not find the correct maximum segment.
   - **func_3(number, quantity):** This function is incomplete and does not perform any operations. It is supposed to calculate the final answer, but it is not implemented.

3. **Algorithmic Approach:**
   - To maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations, we should focus on the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is positive, we can repeatedly insert this sum to maximize the total sum.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is zero or negative, inserting it will not increase the sum, so we should just return the sum of the original array modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - We need to use a more reliable method to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, such as Kadane's algorithm.
   - We then need to calculate the final sum after `k` operations, taking into account the modulo operation.

### Evaluation of Annotated Code:

- **Annotated Function 1:**
  - The function `func_1` is correctly implemented and returns the remainder of the integer `number` when divided by \(10^9 + 7\).

- **Annotated Function 2:**
  - The function `func_2` is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices, but it has several issues:
    - **Initialization of `new_segment` and `max_segment`:** `new_segment` is sometimes a list with two elements and sometimes an empty list, which is inconsistent.
    - **Logic for Updating `max_segment` and `new_segment`:** The logic for updating these segments is flawed and can lead to incorrect results.
    - **Appending to `segments_variants`:** The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` multiple times, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
    - **Final Loop to Find Maximum Segment:** The final loop to find the maximum segment is flawed and may not find the correct maximum segment.

- **Main Program:**
  - The main program reads the input, calls `func_2` to find the maximum segment, and then calculates the final answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
  - However, since `func_2` is flawed, the `max_segment` returned may be incorrect, leading to an incorrect final answer.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the provided functions, particularly in `func_2`, the program is incorrect. The logic in `func_2` is flawed, and `func_3` is not implemented, which are critical for solving the problem correctly.

Final: **False**
