Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a segment of `arr` that has the highest sum. The segment is represented as a list containing the sum of the segment, the starting index, and the ending index. If the list `arr` is empty or all elements are negative, the function returns `[-1]`. **
