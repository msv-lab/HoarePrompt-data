### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating the Number of Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `t` is calculated as `b * 2`, which is the total number of cells required for all 2x2 icons.
   - The number of screens required for the 2x2 icons is then calculated by dividing `t` by 5 and rounding up if there is a remainder. This is because each screen has 5 rows, and each 2x2 icon occupies 2 rows, so `t` represents the total number of rows needed for all 2x2 icons.
   - The formula `t = t // 5 + (t % 5 > 0)` is used to ensure that if there is a remainder, an additional screen is added. However, the program uses `t = t // 5 + 1` which is equivalent but less clear.

3. **Calculating the Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The variable `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which represents the total number of cells available on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` (the remaining space) is greater than or equal to `a` (the number of 1x1 icons), then the current number of screens `t` is sufficient.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, then additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. The number of additional screens required is calculated by `t2 = a - t1` and then dividing `t2` by 15 and rounding up if there is a remainder.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Issues:
- The calculation of `t` for the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is incorrect. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, not 2 rows. Therefore, the total number of cells required for `b` 2x2 icons should be `b * 4`, not `b * 2`.
- The formula `t = t // 5 + 1` is used to determine the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons, which is incorrect. The correct formula should be `t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15` to account for the total number of cells and round up correctly.
- The calculation of `t1` is also incorrect because it is based on the incorrect value of `t`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15
        
        # Calculate the remaining space for 1x1 icons
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        # Check if the remaining space is enough for all 1x1 icons
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        
        print(t)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.
- The corrected program should work as intended.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
