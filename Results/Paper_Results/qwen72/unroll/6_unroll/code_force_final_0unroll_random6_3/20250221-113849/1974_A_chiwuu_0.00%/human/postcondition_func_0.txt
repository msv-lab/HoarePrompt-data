The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it reads an integer `n` from the input, which specifies the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, performs a series of calculations to determine a value `t`, and prints `t`. The values of `a` and `b` are processed independently in each iteration, and the function does not affect any external variables or parameters.
