Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens required to place all the application icons, given the constraints on the sizes of the icons and the screen grid.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating the Number of Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons by multiplying `b` (number of 2x2 icons) by 2 (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells and each screen has 15 cells, 2 icons fit per screen).
   - It then divides this product by 5 and rounds up to the nearest integer to get the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons.

3. **Calculating the Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons on the screens already determined.
   - It then calculates the remaining cells available on these screens by subtracting the occupied cells from the total cells (15 cells per screen).

4. **Determining if Additional Screens are Needed for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells are enough to accommodate all the 1x1 icons, the number of screens remains the same.
   - If not, it calculates the additional number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons and adds this to the total number of screens.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

- **Initial Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
  - `t = b * 2` calculates the total number of 2x2 icons that can fit on a screen.
  - `t = t // 5 + (t % 5 > 0)` correctly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. This is because each screen can hold 2 icons, and we need to round up if there are any remaining icons.

- **Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
  - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` calculates the total number of cells available on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
  - `if t1 >= a` checks if the remaining cells are enough to place all the 1x1 icons.

- **Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
  - If the remaining cells are not enough, `t2 = a - t1` calculates the number of additional 1x1 icons that need to be placed.
  - `t = t + t2 // 15 + (t2 % 15 > 0)` correctly calculates the additional number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

The logic and calculations seem to be correct, and the program should handle all the test cases as described in the problem statement. However, there is a minor issue in the code where the variable `t` is not properly updated in the case where `t1 >= a`. This can be fixed by ensuring that `t` is not modified if `t1 >= a`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            pass  # No need to change t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

Given the corrected logic, the program should now correctly determine the minimum number of screens required for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
