Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization of `row[0]` and `row[i]` in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes `row[0]` to 1, which is incorrect because the cost of installing a support in the first column (which is a river bank) should be `a_{i,1} + 1`, which is 1. However, this initialization is redundant because the first column is always 0 and should remain 0.
   - The loop `for i in range(1, d): row[i] = row[i] + 2` is also incorrect. The cost of installing a support in a cell should be `a_{i,j} + 1`, not `a_{i,j} + 2`.

2. **Heap Management in `func_1`:**
   - The heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports within a sliding window of size `d`. However, the way the heap is managed is flawed. The condition `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):` is incorrect. It should be `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - d:` to ensure that the heap only contains elements within the window of size `d`.

3. **Cost Calculation in `func_1`:**
   - The cost calculation `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` is incorrect. The correct cost should be `row[i] = e[0] + (row[i] + 1)`, where `e[0]` is the minimum cost of the previous support within the window, and `row[i] + 1` is the cost of installing a support in the current cell.

4. **Overall Cost Calculation in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost. However, the correctness of `func_2` depends on the correctness of `func_1`.

### Corrected Version of `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(row, d: int):
    min_heap = [(row[i] + 1, i) for i in range(d)]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while min_heap[0][1] <= i - d:
            heappop(min_heap)
        row[i] = min_heap[0][0] + (row[i] + 1)
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
    return row[-1]
```

### Corrected Version of `func_2`:
```python
def func_2():
    (n, m, k, d) = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = [sum(costs[i:i + k]) for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1))]
    print(min(total_costs))
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program has several logical and implementation errors, particularly in the `func_1` function. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
