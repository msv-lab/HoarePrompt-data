### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows of a grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than d.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell (i, j) is \(a_{i,j} + 1\).

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - The function initializes the first cell with a cost of 1 (since \(a_{i,1} = 0\)).
     - It then iterates through the first d cells, setting their costs to \(a_{i,j} + 2\) (since the first support is already placed at the first column).
   - **Min-Heap**:
     - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports within the last d+1 cells.
     - For each cell beyond the first d cells, it pops the minimum cost from the heap that is within the valid range (i.e., the distance from the current cell is no more than d).
     - It updates the cost of the current cell by adding the minimum cost from the heap and the cost of the current cell plus 1.
     - It pushes the updated cost and the current cell index back into the heap.
   - **Final Cost**:
     - Finally, it returns the cost of the last cell, which represents the minimum cost to install supports for the entire row.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Input Reading**:
     - The function reads the input for each test case, including the dimensions of the grid (n, m), the number of bridges (k), and the maximum distance between supports (d).
     - It reads the grid values for each row.
   - **Cost Calculation**:
     - It calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - **Total Cost Calculation**:
     - It then calculates the total cost for building k consecutive bridges by summing the costs of k consecutive rows.
   - **Output**:
     - It prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of k consecutive rows.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - **Single Row**:
     - If \(k = 1\), the function correctly calculates the minimum cost for a single row.
   - **Multiple Rows**:
     - If \(k > 1\), the function correctly calculates the minimum total cost for k consecutive rows.
   - **Constraints**:
     - The function handles the constraints \(1 \le k \le n \le 100\), \(3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5\), and \(1 \le d \le m\) appropriately.
   - **Heap Management**:
     - The use of a min-heap ensures that the algorithm efficiently finds the minimum cost for each cell, considering the constraint on the maximum distance between supports.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity for `func_1` is \(O(m \log d)\), where \(m\) is the number of columns and \(d\) is the maximum distance between supports.
   - The time complexity for `func_2` is \(O(t \cdot n \cdot m \log d)\), where \(t\) is the number of test cases, \(n\) is the number of rows, and \(m\) is the number of columns.
   - This complexity is efficient given the constraints.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:

- **Initialization**:
  - `row[0] = 1` ensures the first support is installed at the first column.
  - The loop `for i in range(1, d): row[i] = row[i] + 2` correctly sets the cost for the first d cells, ensuring the first support is already placed.

- **Min-Heap**:
  - The min-heap is initialized with the first d elements.
  - The while loop `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2): pass` ensures that only the relevant elements (within the distance d) are considered.
  - The cost update `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` is correct, as it adds the minimum cost from the heap and the cost of the current cell plus 1.
  - The heap is updated with the new cost and the current index.

- **Final Cost**:
  - The function returns `row[-1]`, which is the cost of the last cell after all updates, representing the minimum cost to install supports for the entire row.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_2`:

- **Input Reading**:
  - The function reads the input values for \(n\), \(m\), \(k\), and \(d\) and the grid values for each row.
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - It uses `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost for each row.
- **Total Cost Calculation**:
  - It calculates the total cost for building k consecutive bridges by summing the costs of k consecutive rows.
- **Output**:
  - It prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of k consecutive rows.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the problem requirements, including edge cases and constraints. The use of a min-heap ensures efficient computation of the minimum cost for each cell, and the overall structure of the program is sound.

Final: **True**
