### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and its behavior based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The river is represented as a grid of `n` rows and `m` columns.
- The first and last columns have a depth of 0.
- Rudolf needs to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
- Each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns.
- The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
- The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where `d` is greater than or equal to `m`. According to the problem description, if `d` is greater than or equal to `m`, the distance between any pair of adjacent supports can be `m - 1`, which means supports can be placed only at the river banks (first and last columns) for each row.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Initialization:**
  - `row[0]` is set to 1 (cost of the first support).
  - For `i` in the range `[1, d)`, `row[i]` is incremented by 2 (cost of the support plus the cost of the cell).

- **Heap Operations:**
  - A min-heap is created with the first `d` elements of the row.
  - For each element from index `d` to the end of the row:
    - The smallest element in the heap is popped.
    - The current element `row[i]` is updated by adding the cost of the smallest element in the heap plus 1 (cost of the support).
    - The smallest element is pushed back into the heap.
    - The updated element is pushed into the heap.

- **Return Value:**
  - The function returns the last element of the row, which represents the total cost of the supports for that row.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Input Reading:**
  - The function reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
  - It reads `n` rows of `m` integers each to form the 2D list `rows`.

- **Cost Calculation:**
  - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1` and stores these costs in the list `costs`.

- **Total Cost Calculation:**
  - It calculates the sum of `k` consecutive costs for all possible segments in `costs` and stores these sums in the list `total_costs`.
  - It prints the minimum value from `total_costs`.

#### Handling `d >= m`:
- If `d` is greater than or equal to `m`, the distance between any pair of adjacent supports can be `m - 1`, which means supports can be placed only at the river banks.
- In `func_1`, the loop `for i in range(d, len(row))` will not execute if `d` is greater than or equal to `m` because `d` will be greater than or equal to `len(row)`.
- This means that the only elements modified in `row` are the first `d` elements, and the last element `row[-1]` will remain 0.
- The cost of the bridge will be the sum of the costs of the supports at the river banks, which is `1 + 1 = 2` for each row.

#### Verification:
- **Case 1: `d < m`**
  - The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each row and then the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
- **Case 2: `d >= m`**
  - The program will correctly handle this case by placing supports only at the river banks, resulting in a cost of 2 for each row.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program does handle the case where `d` is greater than or equal to `m` correctly. The cost for each row will be 2, and the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows will be `2 * k`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
