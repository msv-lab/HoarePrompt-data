To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(total_costs))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `total_costs` is a list of integers.
   - Each element in `total_costs` is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
   - The first element of `total_costs` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`.
   - The second element of `total_costs` is the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs`, and so on.
   - The length of `total_costs` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

2. **Understanding `total_costs`:**
   - If `costs` is a list of integers and `k` is a positive integer, then `total_costs` is constructed by summing `k` consecutive elements from `costs`.
   - For example, if `costs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 3`, then:
     - `total_costs[0] = costs[0] + costs[1] + costs[2] = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`
     - `total_costs[1] = costs[1] + costs[2] + costs[3] = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9`
     - `total_costs[2] = costs[2] + costs[3] + costs[4] = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12`
   - Therefore, `total_costs = [6, 9, 12]`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Value:**
   - The `min(total_costs)` function will find the smallest element in the `total_costs` list.
   - In the example above, `min(total_costs) = min([6, 9, 12]) = 6`.

4. **General Case:**
   - Without the exact values of `costs` and `k`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`.
   - However, we know that `min(total_costs)` will be the smallest sum of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the smallest sum of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where min(total_costs) is the smallest sum of k consecutive elements in the costs list)**
