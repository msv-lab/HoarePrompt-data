Precondition: **The function does not take any parameters, but it reads input values for n, m, k, and d where n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. n, m, k, and d are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. The function also reads n rows of m integers each, forming a 2D list rows where each element rows[i][j] represents the depth a_{i,j} of the river cell, with the constraints 0 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^6 and a_{i,1} = a_{i,m} = 0.**
