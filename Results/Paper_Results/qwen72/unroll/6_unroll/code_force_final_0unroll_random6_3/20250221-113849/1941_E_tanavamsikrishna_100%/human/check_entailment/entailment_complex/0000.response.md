Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` and constructs the 2D list `rows` correctly. The input constraints are respected, and the list `rows` is formed with the correct dimensions and values.

2. **Cost Calculation for Each Row**:
   - `func_1` is called for each row to compute the cost of installing supports. The function `func_1` modifies the row by setting `row[0]` to 1 and incrementing each element in the range 1 to `d-1` by 2. This ensures that the cost of installing supports in the first `d` cells is correctly calculated.
   - The function then uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost within a sliding window of size `d`. For each cell from `d` to the end of the row, it updates the cost based on the smallest element in the heap. This ensures that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

3. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   - After computing the cost for each row, `func_2` calculates the total cost for all possible segments of `k` consecutive rows. This is done by summing the costs of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list and storing these sums in `total_costs`.
   - Finally, `func_2` prints the minimum value from `total_costs`, which represents the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `k` is 1 correctly by simply returning the cost of the single row.
   - The function also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n` correctly by summing the costs of all rows.

5. **Constraints**:
   - The constraints on `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are respected throughout the program. The use of a min-heap and the sliding window approach ensures that the program can handle the maximum input sizes efficiently.

6. **Output**:
   - The output is the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows, which matches the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
