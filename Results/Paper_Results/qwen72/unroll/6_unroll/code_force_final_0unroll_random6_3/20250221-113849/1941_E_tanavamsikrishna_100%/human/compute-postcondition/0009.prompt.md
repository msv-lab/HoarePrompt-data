You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers with row[0] and row[-1] being 0, and d is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= len(row) - 1.
def func_1(row, d):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
        
    #State: row is a list of non-negative integers with row[0] = 1, row[i] = row[i] + 2 for 1 <= i < d, and row[-1] = 0.
    min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass
        
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
        
        heappush(min_heap, e)
        
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
        
    #State: row is a list of non-negative integers where row[0] = 1, row[i] = row[i] + 2 for 1 <= i < d, and row[i] for i >= d is updated based on the smallest element in the window of the first d elements of row that are still relevant. min_heap is a valid min-heap containing tuples of the form (row[j], j) for the relevant indices.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list `row`, which is a non-negative integer updated based on the smallest element in the window of the first `d` elements of `row` that are still relevant.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers with the first and last elements being 0, and a positive integer `d` such that 1 <= d <= len(row) - 1. It returns the last element of `row`, updated based on the smallest element in the first `d` elements of `row`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the last element of the list `row`, which is a non-negative integer updated based on the smallest element in the window of the first `d` elements of `row` that are still relevant.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
