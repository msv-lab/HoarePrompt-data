### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates `T` times to read the values of `a` and `b` for each test case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - **Case `a == b`**: If Alice and Bob have the same number of coins, the game will always end in Bob's favor because Alice will be forced to make the first move, and both players will follow the same sequence of moves, leading to Bob's win. The program correctly prints 'Bob' in this case.
   - **Case `a == 1`**: If Alice has only 1 coin, she will lose because she cannot remove a coin after the first move. The program correctly prints 'Alice' in this case, which is incorrect. Alice should lose, so the correct output should be 'Bob'.
   - **Case `b == 1`**: If Bob has only 1 coin, Alice can always win by forcing Bob to remove his last coin. The program correctly prints 'Bob' in this case, which is incorrect. Alice should win, so the correct output should be 'Alice'.

3. **General Cases**:
   - **Case `a % 2 == 1`**: If Alice has an odd number of coins, she can always force Bob into a position where he has an even number of coins, and she can win. The program correctly prints 'Bob' in this case, which is incorrect. Alice should win, so the correct output should be 'Alice'.
   - **Case `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`**: If Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, Alice can always win by forcing Bob to remove his last coin. The program correctly prints 'Alice' in this case.
   - **Case `a > b`**: If Alice has more coins than Bob, the program prints 'Bob'. This is incorrect. If Alice has more coins, she can always force Bob into a losing position. The correct output should be 'Alice'.
   - **Case `a < b`**: If Alice has fewer coins than Bob, the program prints 'Alice'. This is incorrect. If Bob has more coins, he can always force Alice into a losing position. The correct output should be 'Bob'.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has several logical errors in determining the winner based on the conditions provided. Specifically, the cases where `a == 1`, `b == 1`, `a % 2 == 1`, `a > b`, and `a < b` are incorrectly handled. The correct logic should be:

- If `a == b`, Bob wins.
- If `a == 1`, Bob wins.
- If `b == 1`, Alice wins.
- If `a % 2 == 1`, Alice wins.
- If `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`, Alice wins.
- If `a > b`, Alice wins.
- If `a < b`, Bob wins.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
```

This corrected program should now produce the correct output for all test cases.
