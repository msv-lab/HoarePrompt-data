The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the integer `T`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, and `T` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `T` must be greater than 0**
