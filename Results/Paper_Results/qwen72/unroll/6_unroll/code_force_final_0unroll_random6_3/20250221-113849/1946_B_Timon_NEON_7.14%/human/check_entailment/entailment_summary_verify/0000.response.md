### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The key insight is that if the array contains any positive numbers, the optimal strategy is to repeatedly select the entire array and insert its sum, as this will maximize the growth of the array's sum.
   - If the array contains only non-positive numbers, the optimal strategy is to select an empty subarray (which has a sum of 0) and insert it, as this will not decrease the sum and will help in handling the modulo operation.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function takes a number and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It is correctly implemented and will handle the modulo operation as required.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function is intended to find the maximum segment sum in the array.
   - However, the implementation is flawed:
     - It does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers.
     - It does not correctly handle the case where the optimal subarray is not contiguous.
     - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is incorrect and does not always find the maximum segment sum.
   - For example, in the input `[-1, 2, -1]`, the function will not correctly identify the maximum segment sum as `2`.

4. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - However, the function is not implemented and always returns `0`.
   - This is clearly incorrect and does not contribute to solving the problem.

5. **Overall Program**:
   - The program is incomplete and does not fully implement the required functionality.
   - The logic for performing the operations and calculating the maximum possible sum is missing.
   - The function `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly find the maximum segment sum.
   - The function `func_3` is not implemented and always returns `0`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incomplete and does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Specifically, the logic for finding the maximum segment sum in `func_2` is flawed, and `func_3` is not implemented, which is crucial for solving the problem.

**Final: False**
