### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations.
   - Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, summing its elements, and inserting this sum back into the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(number)`**: This function returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is a correct implementation for the modulo operation.
   - **`func_2(arr)`**: This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices. However, there are several issues with this function:
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array is entirely negative.
     - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed. It does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray.
     - The function returns a segment with a sum of \(-1\) if no valid segment is found, which is incorrect.
   - **`func_3(number, quantity)`**: This function is incomplete and does not perform any operations. It is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum after `k` operations, but it is empty and does not return anything.

3. **Algorithmic Approach**:
   - The correct approach to solve this problem involves understanding that the maximum sum can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum sum subarray.
   - If the array contains at least one positive number, the maximum sum subarray will be the entire array itself.
   - If the array is entirely negative, the maximum sum subarray is an empty subarray, which has a sum of 0.
   - The maximum possible sum after `k` operations can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{max\_sum} = \text{sum\_of\_array} \times (2^k - 1) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the fact that each operation effectively doubles the sum of the array and adds the original sum of the array.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should:
     - Calculate the sum of the array.
     - Determine if the array contains any positive numbers.
     - Use the formula to calculate the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
     - Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:
Given the issues in `func_2` and the incomplete `func_3`, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
