Output State: **`new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [sum of all positive integers in `arr`, index of the last positive integer in `arr`], `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a segment of `arr` that was considered as a potential maximum segment, and now includes an additional sublist which is `max_segment` plus `[len(arr) - 1]`, `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is [-1].**

The code snippet `total_max_segment = [-1]` initializes the variable `total_max_segment` to a list containing the single element `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
