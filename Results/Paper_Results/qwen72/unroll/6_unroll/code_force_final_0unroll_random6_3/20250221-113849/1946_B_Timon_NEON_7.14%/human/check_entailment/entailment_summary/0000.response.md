### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be output modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1`**: This function takes an integer `number` and returns the remainder when `number` is divided by \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct and necessary for the problem as it ensures the output is within the required modulo.

   - **`func_2`**: This function is supposed to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum and its indices. However, the function has some issues:
     - It initializes `max_segment` and `new_segment` with a single element, which is not consistent with the expected output format.
     - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers.
     - The function appends `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` even if `new_segment` is empty or `max_segment` is not a valid segment.
     - The final check for `total_max_segment` is not robust, and it may return `[-1]` even when there are valid segments.

   - **`func_3`**: This function is not used in the main program and always returns `0`. It seems to be a placeholder or an incomplete function. Since it is not used, it does not affect the correctness of the program, but it is unnecessary.

3. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_2` to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum.
   - If the maximum segment sum is `-1` (indicating no positive subarray), it sets the segment sum to `0`.
   - It calculates the final answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - It prints the result of `func_1` applied to the calculated answer.

### Issues:
- **`func_2`**: The function does not correctly identify the maximum contiguous subarray sum. It may return incorrect results, especially when the array contains only negative numbers or when the array has multiple positive segments.
- **`func_3`**: This function is not used and always returns `0`, which is not relevant to the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program is **incorrect** because `func_2` does not correctly identify the maximum contiguous subarray sum, which is crucial for the main logic to work as intended.

### Correctness: **False**
