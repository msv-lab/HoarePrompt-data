#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a list `total_max_segment`. If the list `arr` contains any positive integers, `total_max_segment` will contain the sum of the maximum contiguous segment of positive integers, the starting index of this segment, and the ending index of this segment (which is the last index of `arr`). If `arr` does not contain any positive integers, `total_max_segment` will be `[-1]`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `number` and `quantity`, where `number` is an integer and `quantity` is a non-negative integer. It returns an integer value `0`. The function does not modify the input parameters and does not return a list as suggested in the comments.
