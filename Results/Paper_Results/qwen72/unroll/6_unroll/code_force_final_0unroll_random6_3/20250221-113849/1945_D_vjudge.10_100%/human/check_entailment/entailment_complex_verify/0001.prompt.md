You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), a and b are lists of integers of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), where each element a_i and b_i satisfies (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9), and n and m are integers such that (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000). The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: pergunta is the minimum value between the initial pergunta and the sum of `x + a[i]` for all `i < m`. `x` is the sum of the minimum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`. The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum value between the initial pergunta and the sum of x + a[i] for all i < m, and x is the sum of the minimum values between a[i] and b[i] for all i from n-1 to 0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `pergunta` representing the number of test cases, two lists of integers `a` and `b` of length `n`, and two integers `n` and `m` where 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. It calculates the minimum value between the initial `pergunta` and the sum of `x + a[i]` for all `i < m`, where `x` is the sum of the minimum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`. The function then prints this minimum value. The input lists `a` and `b`, and the integers `n` and `m` remain unchanged after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `numCasos`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')`, which is a good starting point for finding the minimum value.

3. **Loop and Calculation:**
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0` in reverse order. This is appropriate because Kirill starts at the end of the queue and can only move forward.
   - For each position `i`, the program checks if `i` is less than `m`. If it is, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`.
   - The variable `x` is updated by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to it. This is done to accumulate the cost of bribing people as Kirill moves forward in the queue.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `pergunta`, which should be the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Correctness of the Loop:**
  - The loop correctly iterates from the end of the queue to the beginning.
  - The condition `if i < m` ensures that Kirill only considers positions within the first `m` positions.
  - The update `pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])` correctly calculates the minimum cost to move to position `i` by considering the current accumulated cost `x` and the cost `a[i]` to move to position `i`.

- **Accumulation of Costs:**
  - The accumulation `x += min(a[i], b[i])` is correct because it adds the minimum cost of bribing the person at position `i` or the cost of moving past them.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `m` is equal to `n` correctly. In this case, Kirill can stay in his original position without any cost.
  - The program also handles the case where `m` is 1 correctly. Kirill will have to pay the minimum cost to move to the first position.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
