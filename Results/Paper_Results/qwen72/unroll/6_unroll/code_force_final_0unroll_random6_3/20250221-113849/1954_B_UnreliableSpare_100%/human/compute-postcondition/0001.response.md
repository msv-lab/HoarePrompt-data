Output State: **The list `a` is a beautiful array, `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`, `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.** 

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `arr`. The other variables and conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
