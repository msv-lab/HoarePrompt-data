You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` is a beautiful array as defined in the problem, and `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: Output State: The list `a` remains a beautiful array, `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`, `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `flag` is False if any element in `arr` is different from its previous element, otherwise `flag` remains True.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
        
    #State: `ans` is the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same as `val` in `arr`, `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are the same as `val` (or 0 if the last element is not `val`), `val` is the first element of `arr`, `flag` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: - Since the exact values of `arr` and the previous `ans` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables and conditions.
        #   - The print statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
        #
        #Output:
    #State: *`ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are the same as `val` (or 0 if the last element is not `val`), `val` is the first element of `arr`, `flag` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `arr` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. For each test case, it processes the list `a` and returns the result of this processing.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
