You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given two distinct non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \).
   - We need to find the length of the longest common subsegment in the sequences \( a \) and \( b \), where:
     - \( a_n = n \oplus x \)
     - \( b_n = n \oplus y \)
   - The sequences are infinite, and we need to find the maximum integer \( m \) such that \( a_i = b_j \), \( a_{i+1} = b_{j+1} \), ..., \( a_{i+m-1} = b_{j+m-1} \) for some \( i \) and \( j \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The sequences \( a \) and \( b \) are generated by XORing the index \( n \) with \( x \) and \( y \) respectively.
   - For \( a_n \) to be equal to \( b_n \), we need \( n \oplus x = n \oplus y \). This simplifies to \( x = y \), which is not possible since \( x \) and \( y \) are distinct.
   - Therefore, we need to find the longest subsegment where \( a_{i+k} = b_{j+k} \) for \( k = 0, 1, \ldots, m-1 \).

3. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The condition \( a_{i+k} = b_{j+k} \) can be rewritten as \( (i+k) \oplus x = (j+k) \oplus y \).
   - Simplifying, we get \( i \oplus x = j \oplus y \).
   - This implies \( i \oplus j = x \oplus y \).
   - The length of the common subsegment is determined by the periodicity of the XOR operation. Specifically, the length is the largest power of 2 that divides \( x \oplus y \).

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( x \) and \( y \) and computes \( k = |x - y| \).
   - It then checks if \( k \) is a power of 2 using the condition \( k \& (k - 1) == 0 \).
     - If \( k \) is a power of 2, it prints \( k \).
     - If \( k \) is not a power of 2, it further checks specific conditions:
       - If \( n = 0 \) and \( m \) is odd, it prints 1.
       - If \( n = 0 \) and \( m \) is even, it prints 2.
       - Otherwise, it computes the length of the binary representation of \( k \) and prints \( k - 2^{(p-1)} \), where \( p \) is the length of the binary representation.

5. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly identifies the length of the longest common subsegment when \( k \) is a power of 2.
   - However, the conditions for \( n = 0 \) and \( m \) being odd or even are not necessary and do not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The final computation \( k - 2^{(p-1)} \) is incorrect. The correct approach should be to find the largest power of 2 that divides \( x \oplus y \).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the cases where \( k \) is not a power of 2. The correct approach should be to find the largest power of 2 that divides \( x \oplus y \).

Correctness: **False**
