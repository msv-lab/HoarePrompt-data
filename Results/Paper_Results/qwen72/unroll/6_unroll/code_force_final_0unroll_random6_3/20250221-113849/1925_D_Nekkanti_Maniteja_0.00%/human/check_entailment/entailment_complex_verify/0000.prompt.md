You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains integers n, m, and k where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 × 10^5. Additionally, there are m lines of input for each test case, each containing integers a_i, b_i, and f_i where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

        print(s % M)
        
    #State: The loop will print the value of `s % M` for each test case, where `s` is calculated as the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `M` will retain their values as input for each test case, and `c` will be the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`. The variables `s` and `a` will be reset to 0 for each new test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k` with specific constraints. For each test case, it reads `m` lines of input, each containing integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. The function calculates a value `s` based on these inputs and the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `10^9 + 7`. Finally, it prints `s % (10^9 + 7)` for each test case. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are used to define the test case, and `s` and `a` are reset to 0 for each new test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Probability**:
   - The probability of selecting a specific pair of friends is not correctly calculated. The program uses `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`, which is incorrect. The correct probability should be `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`, since there are `n * (n - 1) // 2` possible pairs of children.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The expected value calculation is flawed. The program uses `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, which is incorrect. The expected value for each excursion should be the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase in friendship values due to the excursions.
   - The expected increase in friendship values for each excursion should be `c * m` (the probability of selecting a friend pair) multiplied by the number of excursions, not `c * i * c * m`.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is applied incorrectly. The expected value should be computed in a way that ensures the final result is correct modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        expected_increase = (c * m * k) % M
        total_expected_value = (a + expected_increase) % M
        print(total_expected_value)
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the probability of selecting a friend pair and the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion. It also ensures that the final result is computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
