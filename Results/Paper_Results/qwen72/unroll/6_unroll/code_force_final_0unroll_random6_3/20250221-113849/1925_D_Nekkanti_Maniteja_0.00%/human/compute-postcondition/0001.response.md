Output State: **The loop will print the value of `s % M` for each test case, where `s` is calculated as the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `M` will retain their values as input for each test case, and `c` will be the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`. The variables `s` and `a` will be reset to 0 for each new test case.**
