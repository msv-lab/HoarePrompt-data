The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes integers `n`, `m`, and `k` with the following constraints: 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 × 10^5. Additionally, for each test case, there are `m` lines of input, each containing integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `k` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the provided test cases. However, the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing integers `n`, `m`, and `k` with specified constraints, and processes `m` lines of input for each test case, each line containing integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.**
