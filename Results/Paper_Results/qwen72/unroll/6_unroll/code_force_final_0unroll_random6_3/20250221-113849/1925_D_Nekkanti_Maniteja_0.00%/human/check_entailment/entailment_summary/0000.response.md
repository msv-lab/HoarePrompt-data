Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen for k excursions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). However, there are a few issues in the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Modular Inverse Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct, but it should be noted that `n * (n - 1) // 1` is simply `n * (n - 1)`, which is the total number of possible pairs of children.

2. **Friendship Value Calculation**:
   - The variable `a` is used to sum the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends. This is correct.
   - The variable `s` is used to accumulate the expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions. However, the way `s` is updated in the loop is incorrect.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion should be calculated correctly. For each excursion, the expected value of the friendship value of the chosen pair is the sum of the initial friendship values divided by the total number of pairs, plus the number of excursions already performed (since each chosen pair of friends increases their friendship value by 1 for subsequent excursions).

4. **Loop for `k` Excursions**:
   - The loop for `k` excursions should correctly update the expected value. The current implementation incorrectly multiplies `c` twice and does not correctly account for the incremental increase in friendship values.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final result should be the sum of the expected values for all `k` excursions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Let's correct the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        if total_pairs == 0:
            print(0)
            continue
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        s = 0
        for i in range(k):
            s = (s + c * (a + i * m)) % M
        print(s)

```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Total Pairs Calculation**:
   - `total_pairs` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is the total number of possible pairs of children.

2. **Modular Inverse**:
   - `c` is the modular inverse of `total_pairs` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - `a` is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - For each excursion `i`, the expected value of the friendship value of the chosen pair is `c * (a + i * m)`. This is because:
     - `a` is the sum of the initial friendship values.
     - `i * m` accounts for the incremental increase in friendship values for each chosen pair of friends over `i` excursions.
   - The expected value is added to `s` and taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Output**:
   - The final result `s` is printed for each test case.

### Correctness:
The original program has logical errors in the way it calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The corrected program correctly implements the expected value calculation and should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect, but the corrected program is correct.)
