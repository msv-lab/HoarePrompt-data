t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, n is an integer where 2 <= n <= 10^5, m is an integer where 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), k is an integer where 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5, a_i, b_i are integers where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n and a_i != b_i, f_i is an integer where 1 <= f_i <= 10^9, and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
