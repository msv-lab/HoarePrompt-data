### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, which are the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, and the number of excursions, respectively.

2. **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M` (where `M = 10^9 + 7`). This is correct because `c` represents the probability of choosing any specific pair of children from the total possible pairs, which is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends and stores it in `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion. However, the formula used in the loop is incorrect. The correct formula should be:
     - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is `c * a + c * m * i`, where `i` is the current excursion number.
     - The term `c * i * c * m` is incorrect because it should be `c * m * i` to represent the expected increase in friendship values due to the pairs being chosen and their values increasing by 1 for each subsequent excursion.
     - The term `c * a` is correct as it represents the expected value of the initial friendship values.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result `s % M` for each test case, which is the correct way to handle the output modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)  # Corrected the denominator to n * (n - 1) // 2
        
        s = 0
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * m * i + c * a  # Corrected the formula
        
        print(s % M)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the formula used to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
- The corrected program uses the correct formula and should produce the correct output for the given problem.

**Correctness: **False****

The original program is incorrect due to the formula used in the loop. The corrected program should be used instead.
