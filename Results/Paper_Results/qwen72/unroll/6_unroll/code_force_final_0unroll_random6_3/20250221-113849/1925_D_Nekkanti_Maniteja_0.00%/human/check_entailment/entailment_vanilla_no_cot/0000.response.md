Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Calculation of Probability (`c`):**
   - The program calculates the probability of selecting a pair of friends as `c = pow(n * (n -1) // 1, -1, M)`. However, this should be `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` because the total number of possible pairs of children is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.

2. **Sum Calculation (`s`):**
   - The program updates the sum `s` in a loop with the line `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This is incorrect because the expected value of the friendship value for each chosen pair should be calculated differently.
   - The expected value for each excursion should be the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase in friendship values due to the pairs being chosen. The expected increase in friendship value for each pair is `c * (i + 1)` for the `i`-th excursion, but the program incorrectly multiplies `c` by `i` and then by `c` again.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The program uses `s % M` to print the result, but the correct way to handle the modulo operation in this context is to ensure that all intermediate results are also taken modulo `M` to avoid overflow.

### Correct Approach:
- The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen can be calculated as follows:
  - The expected value for each chosen pair is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs plus the expected increase in friendship values due to the pairs being chosen.
  - The expected increase in friendship value for each pair is `c * (i + 1)` for the `i`-th excursion, where `c` is the probability of selecting a pair of friends.
  - The total expected value is the sum of these expected values over all `k` excursions.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        a = a % M
        for i in range(k):
            s = (s + c * (a + (i + 1) * m)) % M
        print(s)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`total_pairs`**: This is the total number of possible pairs of children, calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- **`c`**: This is the probability of selecting a pair of friends, calculated as the modular inverse of `total_pairs` modulo `M`.
- **`a`**: This is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs.
- **`s`**: This is the total expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions.
- **Loop**: For each excursion, the expected value is updated by adding the expected increase in friendship value, which is `c * (a + (i + 1) * m)`.
- **Modulo**: All intermediate results are taken modulo `M` to ensure correctness and avoid overflow.

This corrected program should now correctly solve the problem.
