### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the pattern alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from 1 to \( k \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - If \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \), it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` and processes the result.
     - If \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \), it calls `func_1(n - x)` and processes the result.
   - `func_1(x)` returns a list of all divisors of \( x \), including both the divisors less than or equal to the square root of \( x \) and their corresponding complementary divisors.
   - The program then checks if each divisor \( s \) from the result of `func_1` satisfies the conditions:
     - \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) (i.e., \( s + 2 \) is even)
     - \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \) (i.e., the potential \( k \) is at least \( x \))
   - It appends valid \( k \) values to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the unique `output` list.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1(x)` correctly finds all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in a list.
   - The divisors are found by iterating up to the square root of \( x \) and checking divisibility.
   - The function returns a combined list of divisors and their complementary divisors.

4. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - The main logic checks if \( (n + x - 2) \) and \( (n - x) \) are even, which is necessary for the settling pattern to fit.
   - It then processes the divisors of these values to find valid \( k \) values.
   - The conditions \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \) ensure that the potential \( k \) values are valid and meet the constraints of the problem.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( k = 1 \) is not valid by ensuring \( k > 1 \).
   - It also handles the case where no valid \( k \) values are found, as seen in the example where \( n = 100 \) and \( x = 99 \) results in 0 valid \( k \) values.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid \( k \) values for each test case based on the given constraints. The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to find all divisors, and the main logic correctly processes these divisors to find valid \( k \) values.

Correctness: **True**
