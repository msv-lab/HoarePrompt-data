Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the constraints and the pattern of the settling correctly.

### Case Analysis:
1. **Pattern of Settling:**
   - The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - For a given position `n` and number `x`, the program should determine the number of valid `k` values that fit the pattern.

2. **Program Logic:**
   - The program uses two conditions to check if `n + x - 2` and `n - x` are even.
   - It then finds the divisors of these values and checks if they fit the pattern.

3. **Issue:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` and `x` are such that no valid `k` exists.
   - For example, consider the input `(100, 99)`. According to the problem description, the output should be `0` because no valid `k` exists for this input. However, the program does not correctly handle this case and may produce an incorrect result.

### Example Input:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  100 99
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  0
  ```
- **Actual Output:**
  The program may not produce `0` as the output, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
