### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Vasya is given his position `n` in the line and the number `x` he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - We need to determine how many natural numbers `k` (where `k > 1`) fit the given constraints.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - If `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`, it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` and processes the results.
     - If `(n - x) % 2 == 0`, it calls `func_1(n - x)` and processes the results.
   - The function `func_1` returns all divisors of `x` in a specific format.
   - The program collects all valid `k` values and prints the count of unique values.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of `x` and returns them in a list.
   - It uses a loop to find divisors up to the square root of `x` and appends both the divisor and its complementary divisor to separate lists.
   - It then reverses the list of smaller divisors and concatenates it with the list of larger divisors.
   - This ensures that all divisors are included in the list.

4. **Main Program Analysis:**
   - The program checks if `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` are even.
   - If they are, it calls `func_1` on these values and processes the results to find valid `k` values.
   - A valid `k` must satisfy:
     - `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` (i.e., `s + 2` is even)
     - `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` (i.e., `k` is at least `x`)
   - The program collects all valid `k` values, removes duplicates, and prints the count.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`.
   - It correctly checks the conditions for valid `k` values.
   - The use of `set` to remove duplicates ensures that each valid `k` is counted only once.
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem description accurately. It correctly identifies and counts the valid `k` values for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
