Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and examples. Here's a breakdown of the logic and why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the position `n` and the number `x` that Vasya received.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the divisors of a given number `x`. It returns all divisors in a list, which is later used to determine possible values of `k`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`: This condition ensures that the sum of `n` and `x - 2` is even, which is necessary for the pattern to fit.
     2. `(n - x) % 2 == 0`: This condition ensures that the difference between `n` and `x` is even, which is also necessary for the pattern to fit.
   - For each condition that is satisfied, it calls `func_1` to get the divisors of the respective number.
   - It then checks if each divisor plus 2 is even and if it is greater than or equal to `x`. If so, it appends the value to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates from the `output` list and prints the length of the list, which represents the number of valid `k` values.

4. **Output Handling**: The program prints the number of valid `k` values for each test case, which matches the problem description.

The program correctly handles the constraints and the examples provided in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
