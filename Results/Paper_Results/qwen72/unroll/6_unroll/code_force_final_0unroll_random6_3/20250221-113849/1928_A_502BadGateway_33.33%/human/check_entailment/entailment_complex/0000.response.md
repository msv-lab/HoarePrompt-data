Reasoning:

The program provided is intended to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can obtain a different rectangle from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles and rearranging them. However, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` is not entirely correct.

### Analysis of the Logic:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if `b` is an even number.
   - If `b` is even, it returns "yes".
   - If `b` is odd, it returns "no".
   - The value of `a` is not used in the function.

### Correctness of the Logic:
- **Case 1: \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\)**:
  - The function returns "no" because \(b\) is odd.
  - This is correct because a \(1 \times 1\) rectangle cannot be cut into smaller rectangles.

- **Case 2: \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\)**:
  - The function returns "no" because \(b\) is odd.
  - This is correct because a \(2 \times 1\) rectangle can only be cut into two \(1 \times 1\) rectangles, which cannot form a different rectangle.

- **Case 3: \(a = 2\) and \(b = 6\)**:
  - The function returns "yes" because \(b\) is even.
  - This is correct because a \(2 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.

- **Case 4: \(a = 3\) and \(b = 2\)**:
  - The function returns "yes" because \(b\) is even.
  - This is correct because a \(3 \times 2\) rectangle can be cut into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle.

- **Case 5: \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\)**:
  - The function returns "yes" because \(b\) is even.
  - This is incorrect because a \(2 \times 2\) rectangle can be cut into two \(1 \times 2\) rectangles, but these cannot form a different rectangle (only a \(1 \times 4\) rectangle, which is the same as \(2 \times 2\) by rotation).

- **Case 6: \(a = 2\) and \(b = 4\)**:
  - The function returns "yes" because \(b\) is even.
  - This is correct because a \(2 \times 4\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle.

- **Case 7: \(a = 6\) and \(b = 3\)**:
  - The function returns "no" because \(b\) is odd.
  - This is correct because a \(6 \times 3\) rectangle can only be cut into two \(6 \times 1.5\) rectangles, which are not valid since the sides must be integers.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` is not correct because it does not consider the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. In such cases, the function should return "yes" if either \(a\) or \(b\) is greater than 1, because Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a different rectangle.

### Correct Implementation:
To fix the issue, the function should check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even and greater than 1. Here is the corrected function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    if a > 1 and a % 2 == 0:
        return 'yes'
    if b > 1 and b % 2 == 0:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
