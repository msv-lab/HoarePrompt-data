Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, but it does not consider the case where `a` is even and `b` is odd. For example, for the input `6 3`, the program will output "no" because `b` is odd, but Bob can actually form another rectangle by cutting the 6x3 rectangle into two 3x3 rectangles and then forming a 3x6 rectangle, which is considered the same as the original 6x3 rectangle. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
