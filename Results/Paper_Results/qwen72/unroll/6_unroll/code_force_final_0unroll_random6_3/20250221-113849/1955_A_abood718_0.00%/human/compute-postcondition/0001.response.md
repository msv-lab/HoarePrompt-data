Output State: **The loop executes t times, and for each iteration, it reads three integers A, B, and C from the input. Depending on the conditions, it prints either A * B, A * C / 2 (if A is even), or X (A // 2) followed by X * C + B (if A is odd). The values of t, n, a, and b remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.**
