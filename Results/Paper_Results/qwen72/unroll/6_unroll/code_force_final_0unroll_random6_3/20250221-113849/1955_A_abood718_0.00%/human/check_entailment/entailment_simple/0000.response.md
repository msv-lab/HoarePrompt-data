### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` from the input, where `A` is the number of yogurts, `B` is the price of one yogurt, and `C` is the price of two yogurts on promotion.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The first condition checks if the price of two yogurts (`B * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`C`). If true, it means buying yogurts individually is cheaper, so the function prints `A * B`.
   - The second condition checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even. If true, it means Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs using the promotion price, so the function prints `int(A * C / 2)`.
   - The third condition handles the case where the number of yogurts `A` is odd. It calculates the number of pairs `X` that can be bought and then adds the price of one additional yogurt to the total cost, so the function prints `X * C + B`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function should print the minimum cost for each test case.
   - The logic in the third condition is incorrect because it prints `X` and then `X * C + B` separately, which is not the intended output. It should only print `X * C + B`.

### Correctness:
The program is incorrect because it prints `X` in the third condition, which is not part of the required output. The correct output should be the total cost for buying `A` yogurts, which is `X * C + B`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
