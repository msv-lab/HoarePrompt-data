Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. For each test case, it reads `A`, `B`, and `C` from the input, and based on the conditions, it prints either `A * B`, `A * C / 2` (if `A` is even), or `X` followed by `X * C + B` (if `A` is odd, where `X = A // 2`). The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the function. **
