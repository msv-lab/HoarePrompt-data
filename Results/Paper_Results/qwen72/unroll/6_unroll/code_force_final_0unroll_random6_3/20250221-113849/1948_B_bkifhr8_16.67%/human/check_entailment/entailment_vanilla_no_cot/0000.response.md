Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Transformation Handling**:
   - The program attempts to transform the array by splitting only the first out-of-order element that is greater than 10. However, it does not consider the possibility that multiple elements might need to be split to achieve a sorted array.
   - The transformation logic is applied only once, which is insufficient. The program should continue to split elements until no more splits are needed or until it determines that the array cannot be sorted.

2. **Sorting Check**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the list is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of itself. This is correct, but it is applied after only one transformation step, which is not enough to determine the final sorted state.

3. **Infinite Loop Potential**:
   - If the transformation logic is applied in a loop, there is a risk of infinite loops if the program does not correctly handle the transformations and check for the sorted condition.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
1. Continuously apply the transformation operation to any element that is greater than or equal to 10 until no more such elements exist.
2. After all possible transformations, check if the array is sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    while True:
        changed = False
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            if arr[i] >= 10:
                a = arr[i]
                arr.pop(i)
                arr.insert(i, a // 10)
                arr.insert(i + 1, a % 10)
                changed = True
                break
        if not changed:
            break
    return arr == sorted(arr)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- The function `can_be_sorted` continuously applies the transformation to any element that is greater than or equal to 10 until no more such elements exist.
- After all transformations, it checks if the array is sorted.
- The main loop reads the test cases and applies the `can_be_sorted` function to each array, printing the result accordingly.

This approach ensures that all possible transformations are considered, and the final state of the array is checked for sorted order.
