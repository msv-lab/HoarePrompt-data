The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of time entries to process. For each of the `n` entries, it reads a time in the format "hh:mm" from the user, converts this time to a 12-hour format with AM/PM, and prints the converted time. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the values of `t` and `s` (if they exist) remain unchanged, and the value of `day` will be 'PM' if the loop runs at least once and the hour `h` is not 12. If the hour `h` is 12, `day` will be 'AM'.
