### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string in the format `hh:mm` and splits it into two integers `h` (hours) and `m` (minutes).

2. **Time Conversion:**
   - The program initializes a variable `day` to 'AM'.
   - It then checks the value of `h` (hours) to determine the appropriate 12-hour format:
     - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'. This is correct because 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.
     - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'. This is correct because hours from 13 to 23 in 24-hour format should be converted to 1 to 11 in 12-hour format with 'PM'.
     - If `h` is 12, it sets `day` to 'PM'. This is correct because 12:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 PM in 12-hour format.
     - If `h` is between 1 and 11, it sets `day` to 'AM'. This is correct because hours from 01 to 11 in 24-hour format should be converted to 01 to 11 in 12-hour format with 'AM'.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` using an f-string. The `:02d` format specifier ensures that the hours and minutes are always two digits, which is consistent with the required output format.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases:
     - `00:00` is converted to `12:00 AM`.
     - `12:00` is converted to `12:00 PM`.
     - `23:59` is converted to `11:59 PM`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly converts the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
