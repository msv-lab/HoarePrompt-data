### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list `arr` of `n-1` integers.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `ans[0]` is greater than `arr[0]`, which is necessary for the modulo operation to work correctly.
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-2`:
     - It sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
     - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it repeatedly adds `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
   - This ensures that `ans[i + 1] % ans[i]` will equal `arr[i]` for all `1 <= i < n-1`.
   - Finally, it sets `ans[-1]` to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This ensures that `ans[-1] % ans[-2]` will equal `arr[-1]`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case, which is the correct output format.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 2` correctly. In this case, `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[1]` is set to `ans[0] + arr[1]`, ensuring that `ans[1] % ans[0] = arr[1]`.

5. **Constraints:**
   - The program ensures that all elements of `ans` are within the range `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`, which is required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates an array `ans` that satisfies the given conditions for all test cases. The logic and constraints are handled appropriately, and the output format is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
