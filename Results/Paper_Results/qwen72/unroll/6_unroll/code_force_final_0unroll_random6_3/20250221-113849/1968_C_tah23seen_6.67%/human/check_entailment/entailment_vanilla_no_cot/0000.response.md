Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` constructs an array `ans` that satisfies the conditions:

1. **Initialization**: The first element `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`, ensuring that `1 <= ans[0] <= 10^9` and `arr[1] = ans[1] % ans[0]` can be satisfied by setting `ans[1]` appropriately.

2. **Construction of `ans`**:
   - For each subsequent element, `ans[i + 1]` is set to `arr[i] + ans[i]`, which ensures that `arr[i] = ans[i + 1] % ans[i]`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it is incremented by `ans[i]` until it is greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that `arr[i + 1] = ans[i + 2] % ans[i + 1]` can be satisfied by setting `ans[i + 2]` appropriately.

3. **Final Element**: The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`, which ensures that `arr[-1] = ans[-1] % ans[-2]`.

The program correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the array `ans` for each test case, ensuring that all conditions are met. The constraints are also respected, as the values of `ans[i]` are within the range `1 <= ans[i] <= 10^9`.

Thus, the program is correct.
