Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list `arr` of `n-1` integers.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function initializes a list `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - The first element of `ans` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `ans[0]` is greater than `arr[0]`, which is necessary for the modulo operation to work correctly.
   - The loop iterates through the elements of `arr` from index 0 to `n-2` (inclusive), setting `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it repeatedly adds `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that `ans[i + 1] % ans[i] = arr[i + 1]` holds true.
   - The last element of `ans` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This ensures that the last modulo operation `ans[-1] % ans[-2] = arr[-1]` holds true.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the list `ans` for each test case, which is the required output.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program ensures that `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `1 <= i <= n`.
   - The program correctly calculates `a_i` such that `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the program, the program appears to correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
