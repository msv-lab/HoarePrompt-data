Postcondition: ***t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a and b are the last pair of integers read from the input for the final iteration of the loop. If the sum of a and b is even, the program follows the postcondition for the if part. If the sum of a and b is odd, the program follows the postcondition for the else part.***
