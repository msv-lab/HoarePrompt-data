The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads a line of input containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). After processing all test cases, the function checks the sum of the last pair of integers `a` and `b` read. If the sum is even, it prints "bob". If the sum is odd, it prints "alice". The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input for the final iteration of the loop.
