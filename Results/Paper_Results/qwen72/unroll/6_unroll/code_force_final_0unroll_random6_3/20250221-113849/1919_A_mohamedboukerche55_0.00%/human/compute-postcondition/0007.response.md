The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and there are `t` test cases where 1 <= t <= 1000. The function is expected to return a result for each test case.

Since the function definition does not include parameters, it is likely that the function is designed to be called in a context where `a` and `b` are provided through some external mechanism (e.g., user input, file reading, or another function).

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), and returns a result for each test case. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.**
