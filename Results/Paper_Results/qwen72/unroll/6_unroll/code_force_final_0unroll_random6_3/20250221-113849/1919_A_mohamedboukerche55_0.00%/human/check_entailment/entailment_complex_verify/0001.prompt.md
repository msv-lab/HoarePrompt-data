You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a and b are the last pair of integers read from the input for the final iteration of the loop.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: *t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a and b are the last pair of integers read from the input for the final iteration of the loop. If the sum of a and b is even, the program follows the postcondition for the if part. If the sum of a and b is odd, the program follows the postcondition for the else part.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads a line of input containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). After processing all test cases, the function checks the sum of the last pair of integers `a` and `b` read. If the sum is even, it prints "bob". If the sum is odd, it prints "alice". The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input for the final iteration of the loop.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can choose to either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After making the choice, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses the game.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, the game will always end in a situation where both players have an equal number of moves.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, the player who starts (Alice) will have one more move than the other player (Bob).

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win because he will be the one to make the last move.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win because she will be the one to make the last move.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It then checks if the sum of the coins (a + b) is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "alice".

5. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not print the results for each test case immediately after processing it. Instead, it processes all test cases and then prints the result based on the last test case's values.
   - This means that the program will only print one result, which is incorrect for multiple test cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle multiple test cases and only prints the result for the last test case. To fix this, the print statement should be inside the loop to ensure that the result is printed for each test case immediately after processing it.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(s.split()[0])
        b = int(s.split()[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This corrected program will correctly handle multiple test cases and print the result for each test case as required.
