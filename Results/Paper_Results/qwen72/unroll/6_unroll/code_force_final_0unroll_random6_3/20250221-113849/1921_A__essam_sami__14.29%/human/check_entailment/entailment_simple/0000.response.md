Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the area of a square given its corner coordinates. However, the implementation has a critical flaw:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the coordinates of the square's corners for each test case.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points: `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`, and `(c, d)` and `(g, h)`. This is done using the formula for the squared Euclidean distance: `(x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2) + (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2)`.

3. **Area Calculation**: The program assumes that the smaller of the two calculated squared distances is the area of the square. This is incorrect because:
   - The sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, so the distance between any two adjacent corners should be the same.
   - The correct area should be the square of the distance between any two adjacent corners, not the smaller of the two distances between arbitrary pairs of points.

4. **Correct Approach**: To find the area of the square, you should:
   - Identify the unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates from the given points.
   - The side length of the square is the absolute difference between the two unique x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, since the sides are parallel to the axes).
   - The area is then the square of this side length.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
