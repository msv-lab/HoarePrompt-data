Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers (coordinates) from the input. It then calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points: (a, b) and (e, f), and (c, d) and (g, h). The function prints the smaller of these two squared distances for each test case. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input variables. **
