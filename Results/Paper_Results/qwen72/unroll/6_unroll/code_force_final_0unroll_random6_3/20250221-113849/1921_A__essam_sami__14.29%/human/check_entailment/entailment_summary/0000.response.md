### Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by calculating the squared distances between two pairs of points and then printing the smaller of these two squared distances. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly identify the side length of the square.

To correctly determine the area of the square, we need to identify the side length of the square, which is the distance between any two adjacent corners. Since the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners.

The program should:
1. Identify the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the corners.
2. Calculate the side length of the square by finding the maximum difference between the x-coordinates and the maximum difference between the y-coordinates. These differences should be equal because the shape is a square.
3. Compute the area by squaring the side length.

The current program does not follow these steps. Instead, it calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points and prints the smaller of these distances, which is not a reliable method to find the side length of the square.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly determine the area of the square for the given test cases. It needs to be revised to correctly identify the side length of the square and then compute the area.
