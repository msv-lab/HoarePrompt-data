The function `func_1` accepts an integer `d` within the range of 0 to n-1, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. It prints a question mark followed by the value of `d` to the standard output. After flushing the output, it reads a line of input from the user, expecting two integers separated by a space. It then returns these two integers as a tuple `(v, u)`.
