Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `T` is an input integer.**

The value of `T` is assigned the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
