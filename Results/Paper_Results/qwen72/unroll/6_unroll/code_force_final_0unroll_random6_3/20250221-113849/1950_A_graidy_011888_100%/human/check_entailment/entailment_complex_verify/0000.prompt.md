You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, the function receives three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, where each digit is an integer such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, the function receives three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, where each digit is an integer such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. `n` is an input integer. After the loop executes all the iterations, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are undefined (as they are reassigned in each iteration), and `i` is equal to `n-1` (the last index of the loop). The loop will have printed 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each iteration based on the conditions provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `n` is provided as input. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9). It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b` and `b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are undefined. The loop index `i` is equal to `n-1` after the loop completes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles all potential cases based on the problem description. It reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by checking the conditions for a stair (a < b < c) and a peak (a < b and b > c). If neither condition is met, it outputs "NONE". The logic is sound and there are no edge cases that the program fails to handle correctly.
