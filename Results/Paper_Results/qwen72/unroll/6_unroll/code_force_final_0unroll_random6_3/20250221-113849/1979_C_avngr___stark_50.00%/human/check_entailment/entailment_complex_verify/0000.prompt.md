You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Example

Input

    6
    
    3
    
    3 2 7
    
    2
    
    3 3
    
    5
    
    5 5 5 5 5
    
    6
    
    7 9 3 17 9 13
    
    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used to determine the bets for each outcome is flawed. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Calculation of `m`**:
   - The program calculates `m` as the product of all multipliers `k[i]`. This is not necessary and can lead to very large numbers, which can cause overflow or performance issues.

2. **Calculation of `c`**:
   - The program calculates `c[i]` as `m / k[i]` for each outcome. This approach is not optimal and can lead to incorrect results, especially when the multipliers are not relatively prime.

3. **Calculation of `hcf`**:
   - The program calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of the `c` values and then divides each `c[i]` by this HCF. This step is intended to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values, but it can still lead to incorrect results if the initial `c` values are not correctly calculated.

4. **Check for sum of bets**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the bets `sum(c)` is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`. If it is, the program prints `-1`, indicating that no solution exists. However, this check is not always accurate.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
The program will calculate:
- `m = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
- `c = [42 / 3, 42 / 2, 42 / 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
- `hcf = gcd(14, 21, 6) = 1`
- `c = [14, 21, 6]`
- `sum(c) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41`

The program will then check if `sum(c) >= m / hcf`, which is `41 >= 42 / 1`, and since this is false, it will print the bets `[14, 21, 6]`.

However, the correct bets should be `[27, 41, 12]` as shown in the example output. The program fails to find the correct distribution of bets that ensures the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve solving the system of inequalities:
- `x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n < k_1 * x_1`
- `x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n < k_2 * x_2`
- ...
- `x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n < k_n * x_n`

This can be simplified to:
- `x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n < x_1 * (k_1 - 1) + x_2 * (k_2 - 1) + ... + x_n * (k_n - 1)`

One way to solve this is to set `x_i = 1` for all `i` and then adjust the values to ensure the total sum is strictly less than the required amount. This can be done by finding the minimum value of `x_i` that satisfies all the inequalities.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases and can produce incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
