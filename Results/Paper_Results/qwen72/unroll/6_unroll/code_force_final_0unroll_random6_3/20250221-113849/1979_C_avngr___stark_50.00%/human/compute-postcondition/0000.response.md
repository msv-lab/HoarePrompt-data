Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, cases is a list of tuples, each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), hcf is the first element of the list `numbers` in the first tuple of `cases`.**

The variable `hcf` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `numbers` from the first tuple in the list `cases`. The values of `t` and `cases` remain unchanged.
