The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function, and `a` is a list of `n` integers, which is already populated. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and is populated with the input integers, `i` is 0**
