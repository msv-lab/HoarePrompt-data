### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Array Modification:**
   - The program correctly modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element `a[i]`. This step ensures that the elements inserted into the set `S` are `a[i] + i + 1`.

3. **Set Operations:**
   - The program converts the modified array `a` into a set to ensure that all elements are unique, which is consistent with the problem statement.
   - It then sorts the set in descending order to form the array `b`.

4. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to track the frequency of each element in the modified array `a`.
   - It then adds additional elements to the list `ans` to ensure it has exactly `n` elements. These additional elements are chosen to be the largest possible values that do not conflict with the existing elements in `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final list `ans` for each test case, which is the lexicographically largest array `b` that can be formed.

### Analysis of the Execution Summary:
- The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` processes the input correctly and ensures that the final list `ans` has exactly `n` elements.
- The additional elements are added in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order of the final list.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to follow the problem description and produces the correct output for the given test cases. The logic for handling duplicates and ensuring the lexicographically largest array is sound.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
