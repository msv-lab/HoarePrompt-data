### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` and processes it.

2. **Unique Character Check:**
   - The function uses a set `a` to store unique characters from the string `s`.
   - If the set `a` has more than one unique character, it proceeds to generate a new string `r` that is different from `s`.

3. **Generating a New String:**
   - The function attempts to generate a new string `r` by:
     - Splitting `s` into two halves and concatenating them in reverse order (`newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]`).
     - Checking if `newstr` is different from `s`. If it is, it prints `newstr`.
     - If `newstr` is not different from `s`, it tries the reverse of `s` (`isreverse = s[::-1]`).
     - If the reverse is different from `s`, it prints the reverse.
     - If both `newstr` and `isreverse` are the same as `s`, it prints a combination of the second half and the first character repeated (`s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2]`).

4. **Output:**
   - If the string `s` contains only one unique character, the function prints 'NO' because it is impossible to rearrange the string to be different from itself.
   - If the string `s` contains more than one unique character, the function prints 'YES' followed by a valid rearranged string `r`.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem statement.
- The logic for generating a new string `r` is sound and covers all possible cases:
  - Splitting the string into two halves and concatenating them in reverse order.
  - Reversing the string.
  - Combining the second half with the first character repeated.
- The function ensures that the generated string `r` is different from `s` by checking the conditions before printing.
- The function correctly handles the case where the string `s` contains only one unique character by printing 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` is correct based on the problem description and the provided example.

### Correctness:
**True**
