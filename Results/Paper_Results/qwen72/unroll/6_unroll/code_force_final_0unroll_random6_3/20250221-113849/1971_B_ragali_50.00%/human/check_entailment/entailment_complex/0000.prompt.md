Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single parameter, `s`, which is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        
        a = set()
        
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The variable `s` will be the last string input by the user, and `a` will be a set containing the unique characters of the last input string `s`. The loop will print 'YES' if the last input string `s` contains more than one unique character, and it will print a modified version of `s` based on the conditions specified. If the last input string `s` contains only one unique character, it will print 'NO'. The variable `t` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It first reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of at most 10 lowercase English letters. The function checks if the string `s` contains more than one unique character. If it does, the function prints 'YES' and then prints a modified version of `s` based on specific conditions: it either prints the second half of `s` concatenated with the first half, the reverse of `s`, or a combination of the second half and the first character repeated. If the string `s` contains only one unique character, the function prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state includes the last input string `s` and a set `a` containing the unique characters of `s`. The variable `t` remains unchanged.
