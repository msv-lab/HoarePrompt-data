The code snippet `t = int(input().strip(' '))` reads an input, strips any leading or trailing spaces, and converts it to an integer, which is then assigned to the variable `t`. The variable `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code. The precondition that `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters still holds. The value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **The function should take a single parameter, `s`, which is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.**
