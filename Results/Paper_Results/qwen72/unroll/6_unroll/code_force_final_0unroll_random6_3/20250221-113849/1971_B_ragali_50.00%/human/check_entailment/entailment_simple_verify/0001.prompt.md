You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single parameter, `s`, which is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        
        a = set()
        
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The variable `s` will be the last string input by the user, and `a` will be a set containing the unique characters of the last input string `s`. The loop will print 'YES' if the last input string `s` contains more than one unique character, and it will print a modified version of `s` based on the conditions specified. If the last input string `s` contains only one unique character, it will print 'NO'. The variable `t` will remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the strings `s` for each test case.
   - The use of `input().strip(' ')` is unnecessary because `input()` already returns a string without leading or trailing spaces. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

2. **Character Set Creation:**
   - The program creates a set `a` to store unique characters from the string `s`.
   - This is a good approach to check if the string has more than one unique character.

3. **Condition for Unique Characters:**
   - If the length of the set `a` is greater than 1, it means the string `s` has at least two different characters.
   - In this case, the program prints "YES" and attempts to generate a new string `r` that is different from `s`.

4. **Generating a New String:**
   - The program generates a new string `newstr` by splitting `s` into two halves and concatenating them in reverse order.
   - It then checks if `newstr` is different from `s`. If it is, it prints `newstr`.
   - If `newstr` is the same as `s`, it generates a reversed string `isreverse` and checks if it is different from `s`. If it is, it prints `isreverse`.
   - If both `newstr` and `isreverse` are the same as `s`, it generates a third string by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s` and prints it.

5. **Handling Single Character Strings:**
   - If the length of the set `a` is 1, it means the string `s` consists of only one unique character.
   - In this case, the program prints "NO" because it is impossible to rearrange the string to form a new string that is different from `s`.

### Analysis of the Program's Logic:

- **Correctness of the Set Check:**
  - The set check is correct. If `s` has more than one unique character, it is possible to rearrange the string to form a new string that is different from `s`.

- **String Rearrangement:**
  - The program attempts to generate three different rearrangements:
    1. Splitting the string into two halves and concatenating them in reverse order.
    2. Reversing the entire string.
    3. Concatenating the second half of the string with the first half.
  - These attempts cover a wide range of possible rearrangements, but there is a potential issue with the third attempt:
    - The third attempt `s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2]` is essentially the same as the first attempt `s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]`. The slicing `s[0:len(s) // 2]` is the same as `s[:len(s) // 2]`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles strings with only one unique character.
  - It also correctly handles strings of length 1 and 2.

### Conclusion:

The program is mostly correct, but there is a redundancy in the third attempt to generate a new string. The third attempt is unnecessary because it is the same as the first attempt. However, this redundancy does not affect the correctness of the program, as the first two attempts are sufficient to ensure that a different string is generated if possible.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
