The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) indicating the state of each cell. Each test case must have at least one cell containing a chip (a_i = 1).
