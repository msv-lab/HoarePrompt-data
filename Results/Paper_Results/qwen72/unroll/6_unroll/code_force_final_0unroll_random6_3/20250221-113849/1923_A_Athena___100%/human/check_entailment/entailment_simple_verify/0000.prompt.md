You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) indicating the state of each cell. Each test case must have at least one cell containing a chip (a_i = 1).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: The variable `t` is unchanged, and for each test case, the variable `res` holds the number of zeros between the first and last occurrence of a chip (`1`) in the list `a`. The list `a` is modified to only contain the elements between the first and last chip, inclusive.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Zeros**: The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` using while loops. This effectively focuses on the segment of the ribbon that contains the chips and the free cells between them.
3. **Counting Free Cells**: The program then counts the number of zeros (free cells) in the remaining segment of the list `a`. This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips so that they form a single block without any free cells between them.

The logic is sound because:
- Removing leading and trailing zeros ensures that we only consider the segment of the ribbon that contains the chips and the free cells between them.
- Counting the zeros in this segment gives the exact number of moves needed to bring all chips together into a single block.

Let's verify this with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `8`, `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
   - Number of zeros: 1
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `6`, `0 1 0 0 0 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1`
   - Number of zeros: 0
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `6`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Number of zeros: 0
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 0 1 0 1`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 0 1 0 1`
   - Number of zeros: 2
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `9`, `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
   - Number of zeros: 3
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly, ensuring that it meets the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.
