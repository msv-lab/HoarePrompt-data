Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) indicating the state of each cell. Each test case must have at least one cell containing a chip (a_i = 1).**

However, the provided function definition is incomplete. It should be updated to reflect the input parameters as described in the problem. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the state of the ribbon.
