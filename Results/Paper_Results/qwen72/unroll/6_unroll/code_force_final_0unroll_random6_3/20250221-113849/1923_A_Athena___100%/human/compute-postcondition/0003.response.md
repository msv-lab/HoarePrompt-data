The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, and a list of lists `cases`. Each inner list in `cases` represents a test case containing an integer `n` (where `2 ≤ n ≤ 50`) and a list of `n` integers (each integer is either `0` or `1`), indicating the state of each cell. Each test case must have at least one cell containing a chip (`a_i = 1`).

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The result for each test case is a string indicating whether the chips can be moved to a single cell or not.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. For each test case, it returns a string indicating whether the chips can be moved to a single cell or not.**
