### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the state of the cells `a`.

2. **Trimming the List:**
   - The function trims the list `a` to remove leading and trailing zeros. This is done using the `while` loops:
     - `while a and a[0] == 0: a.pop(0)` removes leading zeros.
     - `while a and a[-1] == 0: a.pop()` removes trailing zeros.
   - This ensures that the list `a` only contains the cells between the first and last chip, inclusive.

3. **Counting Zeros:**
   - The function then counts the number of zeros in the trimmed list `a` using the loop:
     - `for i in range(len(a)): if a[i] == 0: res += 1`
   - This count represents the number of free cells between the first and last chip.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the count of zeros for each test case, which is the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block.

### Analysis of the Solution:
- The goal is to move chips to form a single block without any free cells between them.
- By trimming the list to only include the cells between the first and last chip, the function effectively focuses on the segment of the ribbon that needs to be considered.
- The number of zeros in this segment is the minimum number of moves required because each zero represents a free cell that a chip needs to move into to form a single block.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
  - Trimmed List: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
  - Zeros: `1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `0 1 0 0 0 0`
  - Trimmed List: `1`
  - Zeros: `0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Trimmed List: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Zeros: `0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - Trimmed List: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - Zeros: `2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
  - Trimmed List: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
  - Zeros: `3`
  - Output: `3` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the input, trims the list appropriately, and counts the zeros to determine the minimum number of operations needed.
