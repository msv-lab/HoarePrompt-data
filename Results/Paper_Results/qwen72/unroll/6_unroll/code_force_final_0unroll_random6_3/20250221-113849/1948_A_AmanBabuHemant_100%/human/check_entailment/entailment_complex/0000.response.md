### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**:
   - If `n` is odd, the function prints 'NO'. This is correct because it is impossible to construct a string with an odd number of special characters where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because special characters must come in pairs (e.g., 'AA', 'BB') to satisfy the condition of being equal to exactly one neighbor.

3. **Even `n` Handling**:
   - If `n` is even, the function constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern 'AAB' `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that every 'A' and 'B' in the string is a special character because each 'A' is followed by another 'A' and each 'B' is preceded by an 'A'.
   - The function then checks if the length of the string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. This is correct because the problem guarantees that if a solution exists, there is one of length at most 200.
   - If the length of `s` is 200 or more, the function prints 'NO'. However, this case should never occur because the maximum value of `n` is 50, and the string `s` will have a length of `3 * (n // 2)`, which is at most 75. Therefore, the length of `s` will always be less than 200.

4. **Output**:
   - The function correctly prints the required output for each test case based on the conditions described.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and handles all the specified cases as required by the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
