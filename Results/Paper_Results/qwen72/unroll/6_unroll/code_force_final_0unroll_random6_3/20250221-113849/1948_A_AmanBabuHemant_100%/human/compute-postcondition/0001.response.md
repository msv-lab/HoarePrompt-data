The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The state of `n` is not relevant to the loop head and does not need to be adjusted. Since `_` is a placeholder variable, it does not need to be initialized before the loop starts. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `_` is a placeholder variable**
