You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 for each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 for each test case. The loop has finished executing, and the values of `t` and `n` are unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 50`, and then for each of the `t` test cases, it reads another integer `n` (where `1 <= n <= 50`). For each `n`, if `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` consisting of the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The values of `t` and `n` are not retained after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case when `n` is 2. According to the problem description, a valid string for `n = 2` is "MM" or any other string where exactly two characters are special. However, the program generates a string with `n` special characters by repeating the pattern "AAB" `n // 2` times. For `n = 2`, this results in the string "AAB", which has 3 special characters (positions 1, 3, and 4), not 2. Therefore, the program does not produce a valid string for `n = 2`.
