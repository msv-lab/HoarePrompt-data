Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem based on the given specifications. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.

2. **Special Character Check**: The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because special characters always come in pairs (e.g., "AA" or "BB").

3. **String Construction**: If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern "AAB" `n // 2` times. This ensures that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string. For example:
   - If `n = 6`, the string will be "AAB" * 3 = "AABAABAAB".
   - Each "AAB" contributes 2 special characters (the first and second 'A' are special).

4. **Length Check**: The program checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If the length exceeds 200, it prints 'NO'. However, since `n` is at most 50, the maximum length of `s` will be `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, which is always less than 200. Therefore, the length check will always pass for valid inputs.

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints the required output for each test case.

Given the constraints and the logic of the program, it is correct and will produce the expected results for all valid inputs.
