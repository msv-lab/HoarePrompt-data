The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function operates with the following inputs: `t` (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), and `a` (a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). Additionally, in every test case, the array `a` is described as beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function's output is not explicitly described in the provided information. However, given the constraints and the typical nature of such functions, it is reasonable to infer that the function processes the input array `a` and returns some result based on the properties of the array, possibly related to its "beauty" or some derived value.

Functionality: **The function processes an implicit input consisting of an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It returns a result based on the properties of the array `a`, considering that `a` is beautiful and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
