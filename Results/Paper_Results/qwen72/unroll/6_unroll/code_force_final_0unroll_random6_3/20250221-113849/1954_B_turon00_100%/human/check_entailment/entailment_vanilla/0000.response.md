### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - An array is considered "beautiful" if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) where \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful, or output -1 if it's impossible.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself \( a \).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and `cnt` to count the number of consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`.
   - It iterates through the array, counting the length of each segment of consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`.
   - It updates `ans` with the minimum length of these segments.
   - After the loop, it checks if the entire array is a single segment of the same element (i.e., `ans == n`).
   - If the array has only one element or if the entire array is a single segment of the same element, it prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum segment length `ans`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: The program correctly handles this case by printing -1.
   - **Array with All Elements the Same**: The program correctly handles this case by printing -1.
   - **Array with Multiple Segments**: The program correctly finds the minimum segment length and prints it.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The program runs in \( O(n) \) time for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by identifying the minimum segment length of consecutive elements that are the same and using this to determine the minimum number of elements to remove. It handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.
