Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly applying the operation: choose an index \( i \) (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \), and replace \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \).

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array \( a \).

2. **Initialization:**
   - `tmp` is initialized to the first element of the array \( a \).
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0, which will count the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - `ans` is initialized to \( n \), which will store the minimum number of elements to remove.

3. **Loop Through the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the array \( a \).
   - If the current element \( a[i] \) is equal to `tmp`, it increments `cnt`.
   - If the current element \( a[i] \) is not equal to `tmp`, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.

4. **Final Update:**
   - After the loop, `ans` is updated one last time to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.

5. **Output:**
   - If \( n \) is 1 or `ans` is equal to \( n \), it prints -1 (indicating it's impossible to make the array not beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

### Issues with the Program:
- **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removals:**
  - The program only counts the number of consecutive elements equal to the first element \( a[0] \). However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful, which means breaking the condition where all elements can be made the same.
  - The program does not consider other elements that might be repeated in the array and could also be used to make the array beautiful. It only focuses on the first element, which is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- **Check if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same):**
  - If the array is uniform, it is impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements, so the answer is -1.
- **Find the minimum number of elements to remove:**
  - We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove such that no index \( i \) (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) satisfies \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Check if all elements are the same
        if len(set(a)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Initialize the minimum number of elements to remove
        min_remove = float('inf')
        
        # Count the number of elements to remove to break the beautiful condition
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i-1] == a[i+1]:
                min_remove = min(min_remove, 1)
            else:
                min_remove = min(min_remove, 2)
        
        # If no such index i exists, the array is already not beautiful
        if min_remove == float('inf'):
            print(0)
        else:
            print(min_remove)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Set Check:**
  - `set(a)` is used to check if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, the array is uniform, and the answer is -1.
- **Minimum Removal Calculation:**
  - We iterate through the array from index 1 to \( n-2 \) and check if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \). If such an index exists, we need to remove at least one element to break the beautiful condition. If no such index exists, the array is already not beautiful, and the answer is 0.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it only considers the first element and does not handle the general case of breaking the beautiful condition. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
