### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. Let's break down the logic and evaluate its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `tmp` is initialized to the first element of the array `a[0]`.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`, which will store the minimum number of elements to remove.

3. **Loop to Count Consecutive Elements**:
   - The program iterates through the array `a` and counts the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - When a different element is encountered, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to account for the final segment of consecutive elements.

4. **Output**:
   - If the array length `n` is 1 or `ans` equals `n`, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make a single-element array or an array of identical elements non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Issues and Analysis:
- **Consecutive Element Counting**:
  - The program correctly counts the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
  - However, it does not handle the case where the array is not composed of identical elements but is still beautiful. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will count the first segment of `1`s and then the `2`s, but it does not consider the structure of the array that allows it to be beautiful.

- **Handling Beautiful Arrays**:
  - The program assumes that if the array is not entirely composed of the same element, it can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum segment of consecutive elements. This is incorrect because the array might still be beautiful even after removing a segment of consecutive elements.
  - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, removing the segment of `1`s or `2`s will not necessarily make the array non-beautiful.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1 or the array is entirely composed of the same element.
  - However, it fails to handle the general case where the array is beautiful but not composed of identical elements.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the general case of beautiful arrays that are not composed of identical elements. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
