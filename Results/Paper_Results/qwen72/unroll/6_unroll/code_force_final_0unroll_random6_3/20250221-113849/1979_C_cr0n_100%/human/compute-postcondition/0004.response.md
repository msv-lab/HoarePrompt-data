To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1` does. Since `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, I'll assume a common function that could be used in such a context, such as the greatest common divisor (GCD) function, which is a common operation when dealing with integer values.

Assuming `func_1` is the GCD function, the loop will iteratively compute the GCD of the current value of `den` and each element `x` in the list `vals`.

### Initial State:
- `N` is an input integer such that 1 <= N <= 50.
- `vals` is a list of N integers such that 2 <= `vals[i]` <= 20 for all 0 <= i < N.
- `den` is equal to the first integer in the list `vals`.

### Code of the loop:
```python
for x in vals:
    den = func_1(den, x)
```

### Output State:
- `N` remains the same as it was in the initial state.
- `vals` remains the same as it was in the initial state.
- `den` will be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list `vals`.

Output State: **N remains the same, `vals` remains the same, and `den` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list `vals`.**
