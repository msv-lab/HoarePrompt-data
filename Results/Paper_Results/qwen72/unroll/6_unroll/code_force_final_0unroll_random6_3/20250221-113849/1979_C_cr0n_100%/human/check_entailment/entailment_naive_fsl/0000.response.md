Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple test cases correctly. The problem description specifies that the input consists of multiple test cases, and the first line of the input contains the number of test cases `t`. However, the provided program does not read this value or loop over the test cases. It only processes a single test case, which means it will fail for inputs with more than one test case.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the number of outcomes `n` is 1. If `n` is 1, the program will calculate `den` as `vals[0]` and then `vprod` as `[1]`. The sum of `vprod` will be 1, and `den` will be `vals[0] - 1`. If `vals[0]` is 2, `den` will be 1, which is not less than 0, so the program will print `-1` incorrectly. For `n = 1`, a valid solution would be to bet any positive number of coins, as the return will always be greater than the bet.

To make the program correct, it should:
1. Read the number of test cases `t` and loop over each test case.
2. Handle the case where `n` is 1 correctly by always returning a positive bet.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
from math import gcd

def func_1(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        N = int(input().strip())
        vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip(). split()]
        if N == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        den = vals[0]
        for x in vals:
            den = func_1(den, x)
        vprod = [den // r for r in vals]
        den = den - sum(vprod)
        if den <= 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))

func_2()
```
