Postcondition: **N remains the same, `vals` remains the same, `den` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list `vals` minus the sum of `vprod`, `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of the original `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.**
