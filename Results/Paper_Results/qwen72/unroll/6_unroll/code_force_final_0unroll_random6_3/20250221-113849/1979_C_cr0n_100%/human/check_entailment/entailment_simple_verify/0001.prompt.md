You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the `i`-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount of coins bet on the `i`-th outcome.
   - The total amount of coins bet is `sum(x_i)`.

2. **Approach**:
   - The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i` to determine the bets.
   - The LCM of the multipliers `k_i` is calculated using the `func_1` function, which computes the LCM of two numbers.
   - The LCM is then divided by each `k_i` to get the bet amounts `vprod[i]`.
   - The total amount of coins bet is `den - sum(vprod)`, where `den` is the LCM.
   - If the total amount of coins bet is not strictly less than the amount received back for any outcome, the program outputs `-1`.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function calculates the LCM of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`. This is correct.
   - **`func_2()`**: This function processes each test case.
     - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
     - It initializes `den` to the first multiplier.
     - It iterates through the multipliers, updating `den` to the LCM of `den` and the current multiplier.
     - It calculates the bet amounts `vprod` by dividing `den` by each multiplier.
     - It checks if the total amount of coins bet (`den - sum(vprod)`) is strictly less than the total amount of coins received back for any outcome.
     - If the condition is not met, it prints `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints the bet amounts.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The LCM approach ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the total amount of coins bet is minimized while still meeting the condition.
   - The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any outcome.
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where no valid distribution is possible by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
