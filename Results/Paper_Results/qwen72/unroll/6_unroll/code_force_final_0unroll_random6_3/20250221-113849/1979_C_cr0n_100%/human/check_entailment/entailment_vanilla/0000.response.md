### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to bet a certain amount of coins on each of the \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the \( i \)-th outcome is \( k_i \times x_i \), where \( x_i \) is the bet on the \( i \)-th outcome.
   - The total amount bet is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \).

2. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - We need to find \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i \quad \text{for all} \quad i
     \]
   - This can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < x_i \times k_i \quad \text{for all} \quad i
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < x_i \times k_i \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < \max(k_i) \times x_i
     \]
   - Therefore, we need:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < \min(k_i) \times \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
     \]
   - This implies:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{\min(k_i) - 1}
     \]

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \( k_i \) to determine the bets.
   - The LCM of the multipliers is calculated using the `func_1` function, which computes the LCM of two numbers.
   - The LCM is then divided by each \( k_i \) to get the bet \( x_i \) for each outcome.
   - The total bet is the LCM minus the sum of the individual bets.

4. **Checking the Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** This function correctly computes the LCM of two numbers using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \).
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - It reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the multipliers \( k_i \).
     - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier and then iteratively computes the LCM of `den` and each \( k_i \).
     - It calculates the individual bets \( x_i \) as \( \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i} \).
     - It computes the total bet as \( \text{LCM} - \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \).
     - If the total bet is not positive, it prints `-1` indicating no solution.
     - Otherwise, it prints the individual bets.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome by using the LCM approach.
   - The LCM approach guarantees that the bets are integers and satisfy the constraints \( 1 \le x_i \le 10^9 \).
   - The program correctly handles the case where no solution exists by checking if the total bet is positive.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
