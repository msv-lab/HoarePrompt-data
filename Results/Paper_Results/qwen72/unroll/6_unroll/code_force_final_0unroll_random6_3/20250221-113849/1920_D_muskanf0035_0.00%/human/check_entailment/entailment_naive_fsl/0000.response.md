Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the second type of operation (b=2) where the array is extended by x copies of itself. Specifically, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` should be `array.extend([array for _ in range(value - 1)])` to append x copies of the current array to itself. The current implementation only appends one copy of the array, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 10
1 1
1 2
2 3
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20
```

After the third operation, the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]` because the operation `2 3` should append 3 copies of `[1, 2]` to itself. However, the current implementation will only append one copy, resulting in `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is incorrect.
