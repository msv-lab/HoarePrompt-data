Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly processes the operations to construct the array `a` based on the given operations.
   - For each operation of type 1, it appends the value to the array.
   - For each operation of type 2, it duplicates the array by extending it with its current elements, which is done by iterating over the current length of the array and appending each element.
   - The function then processes the queries by accessing the array at the specified indices, adjusted by taking `(k - 1) % len(array)` to handle large indices that exceed the current length of the array.
   - The function returns the results correctly.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the operations and queries and calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
   - The results from `func_1` are printed for each test case.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases and resets the variables for each new test case.

3. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct and matches the problem description.
   - The output format is also correct, printing the results for each test case as required.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function handles the constraints specified in the problem, such as the range of `n`, `q`, and the values of `b` and `x`.
   - The use of `(k - 1) % len(array)` ensures that the function can handle large query indices without running into index out of range errors.

However, there is a potential issue in `func_1`:
- The operation of type 2 should append `x` copies of the current array to itself, but the current implementation only appends one copy. This means the array is not being duplicated `x` times as required by the problem statement.

To fix this, the line:
```python
array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
```
should be changed to:
```python
array.extend(array * value)
```
This will correctly append `x` copies of the array to itself.

Given this issue, the program is currently incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
