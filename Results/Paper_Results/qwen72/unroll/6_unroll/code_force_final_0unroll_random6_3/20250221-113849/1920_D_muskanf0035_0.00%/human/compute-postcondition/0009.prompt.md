You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value) such that op_type is either 1 or 2, and value is a positive integer. queries is a list of positive integers, each representing a query index.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: `n` remains a positive integer, `operations` remains the same list of tuples, `queries` remains the same list of positive integers, `array` is a list containing elements based on the operations performed, and `result` remains an empty list.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: Output State: `n` remains a positive integer, `operations` remains the same list of tuples, `queries` remains the same list of positive integers, `array` is a list containing elements based on the operations performed, and `result` is a list containing the elements from `array` at the positions specified by the `queries` (where each position is adjusted by taking `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`).
    return result
    #The program returns a list `result` containing the elements from `array` at the positions specified by the `queries`, where each position is adjusted by taking `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`. The `array` is a list containing elements based on the operations performed, and `n` remains a positive integer, `operations` remains the same list of tuples, and `queries` remains the same list of positive integers.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list of tuples `operations` where each tuple is `(op_type, value)` with `op_type` being 1 or 2 and `value` a positive integer, and a list of positive integers `queries`. It returns a list `result` containing the elements from `array` at the positions specified by `queries`, where each position is adjusted by taking `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`. The `array` is constructed based on the operations provided.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `result` containing the elements from `array` at the positions specified by the `queries`, where each position is adjusted by taking `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`. The `array` is a list containing elements based on the operations performed, and `n` remains a positive integer, `operations` remains the same list of tuples, and `queries` remains the same list of positive integers.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
