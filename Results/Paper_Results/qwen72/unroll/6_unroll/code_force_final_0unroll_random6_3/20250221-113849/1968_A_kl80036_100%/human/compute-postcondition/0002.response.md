The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `x`. `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers, `t` and `x`, within the specified ranges and return a value based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `t` and `x`, where `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000. The function returns a value based on these inputs.**
