Functionality: ** The function `func_3` accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It modifies the list `ops` by appending several lists of integers to it, and updates the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` to contain the value `n` (which is equal to `l - r + 1`) for all indices from `r` to `l` inclusive. The function returns the modified list `lst`. **
