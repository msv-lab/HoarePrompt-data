Output State: **lst is a list of integers, r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), ops is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing an operation, and the last element of ops is [r + 1, l + 1]. The minimum value in the sublist lst[r:l + 1] remains 0, and the second-to-last element of ops is [r + 1, l + 1]. The function `func_2` has been called with arguments `r`, `l`, and `ops`, but without the definition of `func_2`, we cannot determine the specific changes to the variables.**

Since the function `func_2` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged, except for the fact that the function has been called.
