You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers, r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), and ops is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing an operation.
def func_3(r, l, lst, ops):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if (min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    #State: *lst is a list of integers, r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), and ops is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing an operation, and the last element of ops is [r + 1, l + 1]. If the minimum value in the sublist lst[r:l + 1] is 0, then the minimum value in the sublist lst[r:l + 1] remains 0.
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
    #The program returns the list `lst` where the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` has been updated to contain the value `n` (which is equal to `l - r + 1`) for all indices from `r` to `l` inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`, and returns the list `lst` where the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` has been updated to contain the value `n` (equal to `l - r + 1`) for all indices from `r` to `l` inclusive.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `lst` where the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` has been updated to contain the value `n` (which is equal to `l - r + 1`) for all indices from `r` to `l` inclusive.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
