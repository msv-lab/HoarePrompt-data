Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying the issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **MEX Calculation Missing**:
   - The problem description clearly states that the operation involves calculating the MEX of a chosen subarray and then setting all elements in that subarray to the MEX value.
   - The provided program does not calculate the MEX at any point. Instead, it uses a heuristic that replaces the subarray with a square of its length, which is not the correct operation.

2. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**:
   - In `func_1`, the sum calculation `sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2` is incorrect. This calculation does not reflect the actual sum of the array after performing the MEX operation.
   - The correct sum after performing the MEX operation on a subarray should be the sum of the array elements outside the subarray plus the MEX value multiplied by the length of the subarray.

3. **Recursive Function Issues**:
   - `func_2` and `func_3` are designed to apply operations recursively, but they do not correctly handle the MEX calculation.
   - `func_3` updates the subarray with the length of the subarray (`n`), which is not the MEX value. This is a fundamental error in the logic.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not output the maximum sum and the number of operations as required by the problem description.
   - The sequence of operations output by the program is likely incorrect because it is based on the incorrect MEX calculation and sum updates.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the required algorithm to maximize the sum of the elements of the array using the MEX operation. The provided program will produce incorrect results for the given problem.

Final: **False**
