### Reasoning:

1. **MEX Calculation Missing**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not calculate the MEX of the chosen subarray. The MEX is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray. However, the program does not include any logic to compute the MEX, which is a fundamental requirement of the problem.

2. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to maximize the sum by replacing a subarray with a square of its length, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach should involve replacing the subarray with the MEX of that subarray and then calculating the sum. The provided function does not follow this logic.

3. **Recursive Function Issues**:
   - The functions `func_2` and `func_3` are recursive and seem to be attempting to apply the MEX operation, but they do not correctly handle the MEX calculation or the array updates. Specifically, `func_3` appends operations to the `ops` list but does not correctly compute the MEX and apply it to the subarray. The function also updates the subarray with the length of the subarray, which is not the correct value to use.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not output the maximum sum and the number of operations as required by the problem description. It also does not output the sequence of operations. The problem requires the output to be in a specific format, which the provided program does not adhere to.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - This function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates a hypothetical sum by replacing the subarray with a square of its length. This is incorrect because the MEX operation should be used, not the square of the subarray's length.
  - The function returns the indices of the subarray that would result in the maximum hypothetical sum, but this is not useful for the actual problem.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - This function is recursive and appends operations to the `ops` list. However, it does not correctly handle the MEX calculation or the array updates. It simply appends the indices of the subarray multiple times, which is not the correct way to apply the MEX operation.

- **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
  - This function appends operations to the `ops` list and updates the subarray with the length of the subarray. This is incorrect because the subarray should be updated with the MEX of the subarray, not its length.
  - The function also appends the same operation multiple times, which is unnecessary and does not follow the correct logic for maximizing the sum using the MEX operation.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the MEX operation, does not calculate the correct sum, and does not produce the correct output format. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
