### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then enters a loop to process each test case.
   - For each test case, the function `func_1` is called, which reads the length `n` and the string `s` from the input.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores this count in the variable `neg`.
   - The penalty calculation is based on the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is derived from the fact that each '+' character contributes +1 to the sum and each '-' character contributes -1.
   - If the number of '-' characters is equal to the number of '+' characters, the sum of the array `a` is zero, and the penalty is zero.
   - If the number of '-' characters is not equal to the number of '+' characters, the penalty is calculated as the length of the string `n` minus twice the number of '-' characters. This is because each '-' character reduces the sum by 2 (one for the '-' and one for the corresponding '+' that is not balanced).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means the string `s` consists entirely of '-' characters. In this case, the penalty is simply `n` because each subarray will have a sum of -1 and a penalty of 1, and there are `n` such subarrays.
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the formula `n - 2 * neg` correctly calculates the minimum penalty by balancing the '+' and '-' characters as much as possible.

5. **Output**:
   - The output for each test case is the minimum possible penalty, which is calculated correctly based on the given logic.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty for each test case based on the problem description. The function `func_1` processes the input and computes the penalty as expected.
