### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and the array `arr` of length `n-1`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The array `ans` is initialized with `n` elements, all set to 0. This is a good starting point for constructing the result array.

3. **First Element Calculation:**
   - The first element `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `a_2 % a_1 = x_2` because `a_2` will be `x_2 + a_1`, and `a_1` is `x_2 + 1`. This is correct.

4. **Subsequent Elements Calculation:**
   - For each subsequent element `ans[i + 1]`, it is set to `arr[i] + ans[i]`. This ensures that `a_{i+1} % a_i = x_{i+1}` because `a_{i+1}` will be `x_{i+1} + a_i`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it enters a while loop to increment `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that the modulo condition is satisfied. However, this while loop is unnecessary because `ans[i + 1]` is already calculated as `arr[i] + ans[i]`, which is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` due to the cumulative sum nature and the initial setup.

5. **Last Element Calculation:**
   - The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This ensures that `a_n % a_{n-1} = x_n`. This is correct.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array `ans` for each test case, which is the correct output format.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements.
- The logic for setting the first element and the subsequent elements ensures that the modulo conditions are satisfied.
- The while loop in the subsequent elements calculation is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.
- The last element is correctly calculated to satisfy the final modulo condition.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and constraints. It correctly constructs the array `a` such that the modulo conditions are satisfied for all elements. The unnecessary while loop does not affect the correctness but can be optimized for better performance.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
