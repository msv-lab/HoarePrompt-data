Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for constructing the array `ans` can fail in certain scenarios. Here is a case where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 3 5
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3 4 6
```

In the actual output, `a_3 % a_2` should be `2` according to the problem description, but `6 % 4` equals `2`, which is correct. However, the program fails to ensure that `a_2 % a_1` equals `1` for the given input. The program sets `a_1` to `arr[0] + 1`, which is `2` in this case, and `a_2` to `arr[0] + a_1`, which is `3`. This does not satisfy the condition `a_2 % a_1 = 1` because `3 % 2` equals `1`, which is correct, but the logic for `a_3` is flawed.

The issue lies in the loop where `ans[i + 1]` is set to `arr[i] + ans[i]` and then adjusted if it is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This adjustment can lead to incorrect values for `ans[i + 1]` in certain cases.

To correct this, the program should ensure that `ans[i + 1]` is always greater than `arr[i]` and that the modulo condition is satisfied correctly. A more robust approach would be to set `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]` and then check if this value satisfies the modulo condition. If not, it should be adjusted accordingly.
