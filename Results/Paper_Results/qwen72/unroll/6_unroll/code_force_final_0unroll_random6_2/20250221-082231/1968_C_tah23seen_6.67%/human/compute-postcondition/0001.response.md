Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros, and `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1`.**

The code updates the first element of the list `ans` to be the value of the first element of the list `arr` plus 1. The lengths and ranges of `arr` and `n` remain unchanged, and the rest of the elements in `ans` are still initialized to zero.
