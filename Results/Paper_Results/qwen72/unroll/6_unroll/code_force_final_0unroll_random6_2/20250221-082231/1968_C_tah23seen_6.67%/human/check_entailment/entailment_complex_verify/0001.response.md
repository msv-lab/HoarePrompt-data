### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` of length `n-1`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The array `ans` is initialized with `n` elements, all set to 0.

3. **First Element Calculation:**
   - The first element `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `a_2 % a_1 = x_2` because `a_2` will be `x_2 + a_1`, and `a_1` is `x_2 + 1`.

4. **Subsequent Elements Calculation:**
   - For each subsequent element `ans[i + 1]`, it is set to `arr[i] + ans[i]`. This ensures that `a_{i+1} % a_i = x_{i+1}` because `a_{i+1}` will be `x_{i+1} + a_i`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it enters a while loop to increment `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that the modulo condition is satisfied.

5. **Last Element Calculation:**
   - The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This ensures that `a_n % a_{n-1} = x_n`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array `ans` for each test case.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `arr` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len(arr)} \leq 500\) and \(1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 500\) for all \(1 \leq i < \text{len(arr)}\).
  - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\).

- **State of the program inside the function:**
  - `ans` is initialized as a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
  - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`, ensuring \(a_1 = x_2 + 1\).
  - For each \(i\) from 0 to \(n-2\), `ans[i + 1]` is set to `arr[i] + ans[i]` and adjusted if necessary to ensure \(a_{i+1} \geq x_{i+1}\).
  - The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`, ensuring \(a_n = a_{n-1} + x_n\).

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **First Element Calculation:**
  - Setting `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` ensures that \(a_1 = x_2 + 1\), which is correct because \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = x_2\) and \(a_2 = x_2 + a_1\).

- **Subsequent Elements Calculation:**
  - The loop `for i in range(n - 2)` correctly iterates over the elements from 1 to \(n-2\).
  - `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` ensures that \(a_{i+1} = x_{i+1} + a_i\).
  - The while loop `while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` ensures that \(a_{i+1}\) is adjusted to be greater than \(x_{i+1}\), which is necessary to satisfy \(a_{i+1} \bmod a_i = x_{i+1}\).

- **Last Element Calculation:**
  - Setting `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]` ensures that \(a_n = a_{n-1} + x_n\), which is correct because \(a_n \bmod a_{n-1} = x_n\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the array `a` such that the modulo conditions are satisfied for all elements. The logic and the adjustments made in the while loop ensure that the conditions are met, and the program handles the constraints and problem requirements accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
