Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.** 

However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should be:

```
def func(x, y):
```

With the correct function definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.**
