### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the list of multipliers `a`.

2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM) Calculation:**
   - The function `lcm` is used to compute the least common multiple of the multipliers `a`. This is a valid approach because the LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets are integers and the sum of the bets can be compared to the LCM.
   - The LCM is calculated using the `gcd` function, which is a standard method for finding the LCM of a list of numbers.

3. **Bets Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by each multiplier `a[i]`. This ensures that the total sum of the bets is the sum of these values.
   - The sum of the bets `sumo` is then calculated.

4. **Check for Valid Distribution:**
   - The function checks if the sum of the bets `sumo` is strictly less than the LCM `prod`. If it is, the distribution is valid, and the bets are printed.
   - If the sum of the bets is not strictly less than the LCM, the function prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution is possible.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the bets as a space-separated list of integers if a valid distribution is found.
   - If no valid distribution is found, it prints `-1`.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **LCM Calculation:**
  - The LCM calculation is correct and ensures that the bets are integers.
  - The LCM of the multipliers is a good choice because it provides a common base for the bets, making it easier to compare the total sum of the bets with the return for any winning outcome.

- **Bets Calculation:**
  - The bets are calculated as `prod // a[i]`, which ensures that the total sum of the bets is the sum of these values.
  - This approach is valid because it ensures that the return for any winning outcome is a multiple of the LCM, which is greater than the sum of the bets.

- **Check for Valid Distribution:**
  - The condition `if sumo >= prod` correctly checks if the sum of the bets is not strictly less than the LCM.
  - If the sum of the bets is equal to or greater than the LCM, it means that the total amount bet is not less than the return for any winning outcome, and thus, the distribution is invalid.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the problem as described. It reads the input, calculates the LCM, determines the bets, and checks if the distribution is valid. The logic and the conditions used are appropriate for the problem.

### Correctness:
