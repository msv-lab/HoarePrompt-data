You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the winning outcomes. The function should return a list of n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome, or -1 if no such distribution is possible.

    #State: The function `func` will have processed `t` test cases. For each test case, if a valid distribution of bets is possible such that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome, the function will print a space-separated list of `n` integers representing the bets. If no such distribution is possible, the function will print -1. The variables `t`, `T`, `prod`, `sumo`, `bets`, and `a` will have their final values after processing all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `bets` representing the number of outcomes, followed by a list of integers `a` representing the multipliers for the winning outcomes. It calculates a list of bets such that the sum of these bets is strictly less than the product of the multipliers (LCM of the multipliers). If such a distribution is possible, it prints the list of bets as a space-separated string. If no such distribution is possible, it prints -1. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `t`, `T`, `prod`, `sumo`, `bets`, and `a` will have their final values from the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), if it wins, the amount received back is \(k_i \times x_i\), where \(x_i\) is the bet on outcome \(i\).
   - The total amount bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\).
   - The condition to satisfy is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Approach:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\).
   - It then sets \(x_i = \text{LCM} / k_i\) for each outcome \(i\).
   - The total amount bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\).
   - If \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \geq \text{LCM}\), it prints \(-1\) indicating no valid distribution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\).

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets are integers and that the condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) is checked.
   - The program correctly calculates the LCM using the `gcd` function.
   - The bets are calculated as \(x_i = \text{LCM} / k_i\), which ensures that \(k_i \times x_i = \text{LCM}\) for each \(i\).
   - The sum of the bets \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\) is compared to the LCM to check if the condition is met.
   - If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints \(-1\), which is correct because it means there is no valid distribution.
   - If the sum is less than the LCM, it prints the bets, which is also correct.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the sum of bets is equal to the LCM by printing \(-1\), which is correct.
   - The program also handles the case where the multipliers are all the same (e.g., \(k_1 = k_2 = \ldots = k_n\)) by correctly printing \(-1\) when the sum of bets equals the LCM.

5. **Constraints:**
   - The program ensures that the bets \(x_i\) are integers and within the range \(1 \le x_i \le 10^9\), which is valid as per the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets and checks the condition as required by the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
