### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program, specifically in handling cases where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **LCM Calculation**:
   - The function `lcm` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \( k_i \). This LCM value, `prod`, is used to determine the bets for each outcome.
   - For each outcome \( i \), the bet is calculated as \( \text{prod} // k_i \).

2. **Sum of Bets**:
   - The sum of all bets, `sumo`, is calculated by summing up the values of \( \text{prod} // k_i \) for all \( i \).

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of bets, `sumo`, is strictly less than `prod`. If it is, the program prints the bets. Otherwise, it prints -1.

4. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: Different Multipliers**:
     - If the multipliers are different, the LCM will be a value that is generally larger than the sum of the individual bets. For example, for the input `3 2 7`, the LCM is 42, and the bets are `14 21 6`, which sum to 41. This is less than 42, so the program correctly outputs a valid solution.
   - **Case 2: Same Multipliers**:
     - If all multipliers are the same, the LCM of these multipliers is simply the multiplier itself. For example, for the input `5 5 5 5 5`, the LCM is 5. The bets are calculated as `1 1 1 1 1`, which sum to 5. This is not strictly less than 5, so the program should output -1. However, the program incorrectly outputs `1 1 1 1 1`.

5. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program fails to correctly handle the case where all multipliers are the same. In such cases, the sum of the bets will always be equal to the LCM, which means the condition `sumo < prod` will never be satisfied, and the program should output -1.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case where all multipliers are the same correctly, leading to an incorrect output. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
