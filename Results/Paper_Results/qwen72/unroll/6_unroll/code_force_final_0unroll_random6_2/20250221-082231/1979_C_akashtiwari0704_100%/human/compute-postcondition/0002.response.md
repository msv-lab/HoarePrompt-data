Output State: **The function `func` will have processed `t` test cases. For each test case, if a valid distribution of bets is possible such that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome, the function will print a space-separated list of `n` integers representing the bets. If no such distribution is possible, the function will print -1. The variables `t`, `T`, `prod`, `sumo`, `bets`, and `a` will have their final values after processing all test cases.**
