### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - The return for the i-th outcome is the bet on that outcome multiplied by `k_i`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.
   - It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers.
   - It then distributes the bets such that the bet on the i-th outcome is `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the LCM of the multipliers.
   - The sum of these bets is calculated and compared to the LCM.
   - If the sum of the bets is less than the LCM, it prints the bets. Otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the return for any winning outcome is a multiple of the LCM.
   - By setting the bet on the i-th outcome to `prod // a[i]`, the return for the i-th outcome is `a[i] * (prod // a[i]) = prod`.
   - The sum of the bets is `sum(prod // a[i] for i in range(bets))`.
   - For the distribution to be valid, the sum of the bets must be strictly less than `prod`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all multipliers are the same, the sum of the bets will be `bets * (prod // a[0])`. For the distribution to be valid, `bets * (prod // a[0])` must be less than `prod`.
   - If `bets` is 1, the sum of the bets is `prod // a[0]`, which is always less than `prod` since `a[0] >= 2`.
   - If `bets` is greater than 1 and all multipliers are the same, the sum of the bets will be `bets * (prod // a[0])`, which is `bets * (a[0] ** (bets - 1))`. This will be greater than or equal to `prod` if `bets >= a[0]`, which is why the function correctly prints `-1` in such cases.

5. **Implementation Details:**
   - The LCM calculation is correct and efficient for the given constraints.
   - The bets are correctly distributed and the sum is calculated.
   - The comparison between the sum of the bets and the LCM is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome and ensures that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. The edge cases are handled appropriately, and the program follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
