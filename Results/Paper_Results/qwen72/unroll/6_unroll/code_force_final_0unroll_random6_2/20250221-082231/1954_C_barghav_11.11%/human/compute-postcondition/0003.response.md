Output State: **The first half of the list `a` will contain the maximum values between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, while the second half of the list `a` will contain the minimum values between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`. Conversely, the first half of the list `b` will contain the minimum values between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, while the second half of the list `b` will contain the maximum values between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`. The variable `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.**
