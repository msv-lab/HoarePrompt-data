The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function is designed to work with an implicit context where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function operates on an implicit context with an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) and for each test case, integers `x` and `y` (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not defined.**
