The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates with two inputs: `t`, a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `x`, an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000. Without further details on the function's output, we cannot definitively state what the function returns. However, typically, such a function might return a result based on the values of `t` and `x`.

Given the constraints, a possible functionality could be that the function processes `t` test cases, each with an integer `x` within the specified range, and returns a result for each test case. However, since the exact output is not provided, we will describe the functionality based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function operates with two inputs: `t`, a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `x`, an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the values of `t` and `x`.**
