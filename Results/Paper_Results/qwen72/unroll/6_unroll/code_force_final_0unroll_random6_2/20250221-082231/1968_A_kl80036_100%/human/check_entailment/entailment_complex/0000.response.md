Reasoning:

The problem requires finding any integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The program provided by the function `func` always sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) and prints this value for each test case.

To determine if this is correct, let's analyze the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \):

1. **GCD Calculation**: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) where \( y = x - 1 \) is always 1. This is because \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are consecutive integers, and the GCD of any two consecutive integers is 1.
2. **Expression Value**: Therefore, \( \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x \).

Now, let's consider if there could be any other \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) that would yield a higher value for \( \gcd(x, y) + y \):

- For any \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \), the value of \( \gcd(x, y) \) is at most \( x/2 \) (since \( x/2 \) is the largest possible divisor of \( x \) other than \( x \) itself).
- If \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = y \), and the expression becomes \( y + y = 2y \). However, \( y \) must be less than \( x \), so \( 2y < 2(x-1) \), which is less than \( x \) when \( y < x-1 \).

Thus, the maximum value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is indeed \( x \), which is achieved when \( y = x - 1 \).

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly outputs \( x - 1 \) for each test case, which satisfies the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
