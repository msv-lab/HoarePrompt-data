Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98

# Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` accepts no parameters and reads input from the user. It expects the first input to be a non-negative integer `t` such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` such that 2 <= x <= 1000. The function then calculates `x - 1` and prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the value of `x - 1` has been printed for each of these test cases. The function does not return any value.

Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
