Output State: **The loop iterates over multiple test cases, each time reading a new integer `n` and a list `lit` of `n` integers. For each test case, the loop processes the list `lit` and distributes the elements between two lists `a` and `b` based on the conditions provided. After processing, it calculates the number of increasing pairs in both `a` and `b` and prints this count. The variables `a`, `b`, and `s` are reset for each test case.**
