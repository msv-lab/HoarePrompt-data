The function `min_penalty` accepts two parameters: `a` and `n`. `a` is a list of integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each element `a_i` in the list is an integer between 1 and the length of the list. `n` is the length of the list `a` and is a positive integer. The function returns the minimum penalty possible based on the elements of the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `n` representing the length of the list. It returns the minimum penalty based on the elements of the list `a`.**
