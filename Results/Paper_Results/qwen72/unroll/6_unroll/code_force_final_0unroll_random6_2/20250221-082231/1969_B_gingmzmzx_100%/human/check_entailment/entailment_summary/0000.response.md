Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The key idea is to count the number of '1's before each '0' and the number of '0's after each '1', as these are the positions where a cyclic shift would be necessary to move the '1's to the right and the '0's to the left.

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case by reading a binary string `s`.

2. **Counting Zeroes**: The program counts the number of '0's in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.

3. **Tracking Counts**: The `cnt` list is used to keep track of the counts of '0's and '1's as the program iterates through the string `s`.

4. **Calculating Cost**: The program calculates the cost `ans` by:
   - Incrementing `cnt[0]` or `cnt[1]` based on the current character `c`.
   - If `c` is '0' and there are any '1's before it (`cnt[1] > 0`), it adds 1 to `ans` because a cyclic shift is needed to move the '1' to the right.
   - If `c` is '1', it adds the number of '0's that are still to the right of the current position (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated cost `ans` for each test case.

The logic of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description. The execution summary confirms that the program processes each test case correctly and prints the results.

Correctness: **True**
