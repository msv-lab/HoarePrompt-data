Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly compute the minimum total cost for making the string sorted in non-descending order. 

Consider the test case `s = "101011"`. The expected output should be `5`, but the program outputs `6`. 

The issue arises because the program incorrectly calculates the cost for each character in the string. It should only count the cost of cyclic shifts that are necessary to move all `1`s to the right of all `0`s. However, the current logic adds unnecessary costs, leading to an incorrect result.
