Output State: **The loop will execute `n` times, and for each execution, it will read a new binary string `s` from the input, convert it to a list of integers, count the number of zeroes in `s`, and then compute and print the value of `ans` which represents the sum of the number of '1's before each '0' and the number of '0's after each '1' in the string `s`. After `n` iterations, the loop will terminate, and the final state will be that `n` will be 0, and the values of `s`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` will be undefined or reset for each iteration.**
