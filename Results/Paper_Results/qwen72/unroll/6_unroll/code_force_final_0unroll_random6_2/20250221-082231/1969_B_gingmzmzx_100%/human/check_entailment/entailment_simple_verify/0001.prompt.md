You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a binary string `s` as input, where `2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5` and each character in `s` is either '0' or '1'. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0

            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `n` times, and for each execution, it will read a new binary string `s` from the input, convert it to a list of integers, count the number of zeroes in `s`, and then compute and print the value of `ans` which represents the sum of the number of '1's before each '0' and the number of '0's after each '1' in the string `s`. After `n` iterations, the loop will terminate, and the final state will be that `n` will be 0, and the values of `s`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` will be undefined or reset for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.

2. **Counting Zeroes**:
   - The program counts the number of zeroes in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.

3. **Counting and Cost Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It also initializes a variable `ans` to store the total cost of sorting the string.

4. **Iterating Through the String**:
   - The program iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - For each character:
     - It increments the count of the current character in `cnt`.
     - If the character is `0` and there are any `1`s before it (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`), it adds 1 to `ans`.
     - If the character is `1`, it adds the number of remaining zeroes to `ans` (i.e., `zeroes - cnt[0]`).

5. **Output**:
   - After processing the string, the program prints the total cost `ans`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - The algorithm aims to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order.
  - The key idea is to count the number of `1`s before each `0` and the number of `0`s after each `1` to determine the cost of cyclic shifts.
  - The program correctly counts the number of `1`s before each `0` and the number of `0`s after each `1` to compute the total cost.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., `0000`) by outputting `0`.
  - It also handles the case where the string contains only one type of character (e.g., `1111` or `0000`).

- **Optimality**:
  - The algorithm is optimal because it only counts the necessary shifts and does not perform any unnecessary operations.

- **Input Constraints**:
  - The program correctly handles the constraints provided in the problem description, including the number of test cases and the length of the strings.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
