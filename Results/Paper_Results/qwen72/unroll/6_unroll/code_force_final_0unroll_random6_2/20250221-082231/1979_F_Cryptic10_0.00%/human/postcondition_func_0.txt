The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `d`, which is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to n-1, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. It prints a query string in the format `? d` and then reads a line of input from the user, expecting two integers separated by a space. The function returns these two integers as a tuple `(v, u)`.
