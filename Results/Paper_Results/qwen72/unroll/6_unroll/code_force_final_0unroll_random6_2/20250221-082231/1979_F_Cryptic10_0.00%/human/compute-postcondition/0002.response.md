For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `remaining_vertices` must evaluate to `True`. This means that `remaining_vertices` must not be an empty set. 

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and represents the number of vertices in the graph.
- `path` is an empty list.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive.

Since `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, it is not empty as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the loop condition is already satisfied, and no adjustments are needed.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and represents the number of vertices in the graph; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive**
