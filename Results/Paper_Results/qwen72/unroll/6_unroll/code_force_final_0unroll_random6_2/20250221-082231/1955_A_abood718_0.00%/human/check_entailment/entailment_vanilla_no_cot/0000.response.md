Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in the way it calculates the minimum cost when the number of yogurts to be bought is odd. Specifically, the line `print(X)` is unnecessary and incorrect, as it prints an intermediate value that is not part of the final output. Additionally, the calculation `X * C + B` does not correctly handle the case where the promotion price is not advantageous for the last yogurt.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b < 2 * a:
            # Use the promotion price for pairs and the regular price for the last one if n is odd
            print((n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a)
        else:
            # Use the regular price for all yogurts
            print(n * a)
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- If the promotion price is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the regular price, it uses the promotion price for as many pairs of yogurts as possible and adds the cost of any remaining yogurt at the regular price.
- If the promotion price is not cheaper, it simply buys all yogurts at the regular price.
