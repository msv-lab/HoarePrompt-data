Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Variable Naming**: The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` are not named according to the problem description. According to the problem, `A` should be `n`, `B` should be `a`, and `C` should be `b`. This can lead to confusion, but it doesn't affect the correctness of the logic as long as the logic is correct.

2. **Logic for Odd and Even Cases**:
   - **Even Case**: If `A` (which should be `n`) is even, the program correctly calculates the cost as `A * C / 2` (which should be `n * b / 2`). This is correct because if `n` is even, Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price.
   - **Odd Case**: If `A` (which should be `n`) is odd, the program prints `A // 2` followed by `(A // 2) * C + B`. This is incorrect because the program should only print the total cost, not an intermediate value. The correct total cost for an odd number of yogurts should be `(A // 2) * C + B` (which should be `(n // 2) * b + a`).

3. **Promotional Price Check**:
   - The program checks if `B * 2 < C` (which should be `a * 2 < b`). If this condition is true, it prints `A * B` (which should be `n * a`). This is correct because if the promotional price is more expensive than buying two yogurts at the regular price, Maxim should buy all yogurts at the regular price.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program should only print one line of output per test case, but in the odd case, it prints two lines. This is a violation of the output format specified in the problem.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it does not adhere to the specified output format and has a logical error in the odd case.

Correctness: **False**
