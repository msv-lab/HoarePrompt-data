Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not correctly handle the requirement to insert `a_i + i` into the set `S` and then construct the lexicographically largest array `b` from the set `S` sorted in decreasing order. Specifically, the program fails to consider the correct sequence of operations as described in the problem statement.

**Case where the program does not work correctly:**

Consider the input:
```
1
2
2 1
```

According to the problem description, the correct sequence of operations should be:
1. Select `i=1` (index 0 in 0-based indexing), insert `a[0] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3` into `S`, and delete `a[0]` from `a`. Now `a = [1]` and `S = {3}`.
2. Select `i=1` (index 0 in 0-based indexing), insert `a[0] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2` into `S`, and delete `a[0]` from `a`. Now `a = []` and `S = {2, 3}`.

The set `S` should be `{2, 3}`. Sorting `S` in decreasing order gives `b = [3, 2]`.

However, the program provided does not follow the correct sequence of operations. It modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element and then tries to construct the array `b` in a way that does not align with the problem's requirements. The output of the program for this input is incorrect.

The correct output for this input should be:
```
3 2
```

But the program might produce a different output, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
