Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` and then, for `t` iterations, reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list `l` of `n` integers. It calculates the maximum sum of a subsequence of `l` where the subsequence can reset when encountering a negative number. The function then computes and prints the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` for each iteration. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the loop has executed `t` times. **
