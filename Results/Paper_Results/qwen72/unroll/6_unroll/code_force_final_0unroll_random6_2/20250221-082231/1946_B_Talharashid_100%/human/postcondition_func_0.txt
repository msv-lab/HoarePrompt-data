The function `func` reads an integer `t` and then, for `t` iterations, reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list `l` of `n` integers. It calculates the maximum sum of a subsequence of `l` where the subsequence can reset when encountering a negative number. The function then computes and prints the result of the expression `(2
