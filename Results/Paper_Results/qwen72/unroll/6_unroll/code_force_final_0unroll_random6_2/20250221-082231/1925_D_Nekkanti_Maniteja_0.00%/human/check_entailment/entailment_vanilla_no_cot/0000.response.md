Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the problem described:

1. **Calculation of `c`**: The program calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is `n * (n -1) // 2`. However, the program incorrectly uses `n * (n - 1) // 1` instead of `n * (n - 1) // 2`.

2. **Friendship Value Update**: The program attempts to update the sum of friendship values `s` in a loop, but it incorrectly multiplies `c` by `i` and `m` in each iteration. This does not correctly reflect the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each chosen pair should be calculated based on the probability of choosing a friend pair and the initial friendship values. The program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for each excursion.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)  # Correctly calculate the modular inverse of total pairs
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        # Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values
        expected_value = (a * k + m * k * (k - 1) // 2) * c
        print(expected_value % M)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Total Pairs Calculation**: `total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2` correctly calculates the total number of possible pairs of children.
2. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: `c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)` correctly calculates the modular inverse of the total number of pairs.
3. **Initial Friendship Sum**: `a` is the sum of the initial friendship values of all friend pairs.
4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - `a * k` accounts for the initial friendship values being counted for each of the `k` excursions.
   - `m * k * (k - 1) // 2` accounts for the increase in friendship values due to being chosen in subsequent excursions. This is the sum of the first `k-1` integers, which represents the cumulative increase in friendship values.
   - The expected value is then calculated by multiplying the sum of these two terms by the probability of choosing a friend pair, which is `c`.

This corrected program should now produce the correct output for the given problem.
