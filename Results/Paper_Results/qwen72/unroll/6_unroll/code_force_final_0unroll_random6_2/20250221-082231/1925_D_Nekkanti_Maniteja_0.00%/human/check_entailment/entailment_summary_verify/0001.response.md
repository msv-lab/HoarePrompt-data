### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` and initializes the modulus `M` to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It calculates the inverse of the total number of possible pairs \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and stores it in `c`.

2. **Friendship Value Sum Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `s` to 0, which will store the expected sum of friendship values.
   - It initializes `a` to 0, which will store the sum of initial friendship values.

3. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program reads `m` pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.
   - It correctly adds the initial friendship values to `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program iterates over `k` excursions.
   - For each excursion, it updates the expected sum `s` by adding the contribution of the current excursion.
   - The contribution of the current excursion is calculated as `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
     - The term `c * i * c * m` is incorrect. The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion should be `c * m` because each pair of friends has a probability of `c` of being chosen, and there are `m` such pairs.
     - The term `c * a` is also incorrect. The expected value of the initial friendship values should be `c * a` for each excursion, but the sum should be `c * a * k` because the initial friendship values contribute to each of the `k` excursions.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The program ensures that the final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `s % M`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)  # Corrected the total number of pairs
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        s = (c * m * k + c * a * k) % M  # Corrected the contribution of initial friendship values
        print(s)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical errors in the expected value calculation.
- The corrected program correctly calculates the expected sum of friendship values for each excursion and the initial friendship values.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identified the issues in the program. The term `c * i * c * m` is indeed incorrect, and the term `c * a` should be summed over all `k` excursions. The corrected program addresses these issues and correctly calculates the expected value. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.
