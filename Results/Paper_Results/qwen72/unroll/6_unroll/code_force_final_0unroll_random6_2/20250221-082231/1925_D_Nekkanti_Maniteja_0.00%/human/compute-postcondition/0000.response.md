To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute if the result of `int(input())` is greater than 0. The state of `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop, as it is the initial value for the range function.

Given the provided state before the loop starts, the only relevant state for the loop to execute is the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times, so `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0**
