Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums` for each book.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of pages `nums` in descending order. This ensures that the two books with the highest number of pages are the first two elements in the sorted list.

3. **Output**: The program then prints the sum of the first two elements in the sorted list, which are the two books with the highest number of pages. This is the correct approach to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read, as she will read the highest number of pages from each pile, and the two largest values will be in different piles.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases correctly. For example, when `n = 2`, the two books will be the only elements in the list, and their sum will be printed, which is the correct output.

5. **Constraints**: The program adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description. It can handle up to 500 test cases, and each test case can have up to 100 books, with each book having up to \(10^9\) pages.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
