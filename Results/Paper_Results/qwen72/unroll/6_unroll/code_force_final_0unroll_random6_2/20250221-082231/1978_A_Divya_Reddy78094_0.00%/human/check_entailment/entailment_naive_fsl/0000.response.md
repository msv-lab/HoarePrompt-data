Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the two piles can have different sizes, and the highest number of pages might be in the larger pile. The program always assumes that the two books with the highest number of pages will be in different piles, which is not always the correct approach.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3
1 100 100
```
The correct output should be `200` because Alice can put the two books with 100 pages each in different piles and read both of them. However, the given program will output `101` because it only considers the two highest numbers and sums them, which is incorrect in this case.
