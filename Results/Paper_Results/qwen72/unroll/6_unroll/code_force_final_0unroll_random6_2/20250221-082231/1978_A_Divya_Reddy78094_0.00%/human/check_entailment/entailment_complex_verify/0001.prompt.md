You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1

    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func()` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_pages(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of pages in each book.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the variable `t` is unchanged. The variable `test_cases` is also unchanged. For each iteration of the loop, the user is prompted to input `n` and a list of `n` integers, which are then sorted in descending order, and the sum of the two largest integers is printed. The variables `n` and `nums` are updated in each iteration but do not persist outside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the user, sorts the list in descending order, and prints the sum of the two largest integers. The function does not modify any external variables or return any values. After the function concludes, the user will have seen the sum of the two largest integers for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums` for each book.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of pages `nums` in descending order. This ensures that the two books with the highest number of pages are the first two elements in the sorted list.

3. **Output**: The program then prints the sum of the first two elements in the sorted list, which are the two books with the highest number of pages. This is the correct approach to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read, as she will read the highest number of pages from each pile, and the two largest values will be in different piles.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases correctly. For example, when `n = 2`, the two books will be the only elements in the list, and their sum will be printed, which is the correct output.

5. **Constraints**: The program adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description. It can handle up to 500 test cases, and each test case can have up to 100 books, with each book having up to \(10^9\) pages.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
