Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of a string `a`, and then reads the string `a` itself. The function counts the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a` and prints this count. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `ans` holds the count of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' for each test case, and the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the string `a` or one less than the length of the string `a` if the last two characters do not form a valid substring to check. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the string `s` is not used within the function. **
