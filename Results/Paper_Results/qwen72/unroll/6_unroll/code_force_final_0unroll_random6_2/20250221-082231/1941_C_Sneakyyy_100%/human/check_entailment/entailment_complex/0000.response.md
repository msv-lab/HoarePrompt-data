Reasoning:

The program aims to count the number of occurrences of the substrings "map" or "pie" in the string `a` and then print this count as the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. However, the logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the program increments `i` by 3 and `ans` by 1 each time it finds a substring "map" or "pie". This approach is incorrect because it only counts the number of such substrings, not the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of these substrings.

For example, consider the string "mappppie". The program will find "map" at the beginning and "pie" at the end, and it will output 2. However, to make the string beautiful, we need to delete 2 characters to remove "map" and 3 characters to remove "pie", resulting in a total of 5 deletions, not 2.

The correct approach should involve identifying overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie" and calculating the minimum number of deletions required to remove all such occurrences. The current program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
