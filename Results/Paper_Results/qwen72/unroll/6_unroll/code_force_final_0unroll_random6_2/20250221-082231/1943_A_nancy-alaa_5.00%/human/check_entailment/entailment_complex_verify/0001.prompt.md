You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
        
    #State: The loop will print the first integer `i` that is either not present in the list `arr` or is present exactly once after the first occurrence of a number that appears exactly once. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` will remain unchanged, but the internal state of the loop, including the `mpp` dictionary and the `first` flag, will be reset for each iteration of the outer loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It then prints the first integer `i` that is either not present in `arr` or is present exactly once after the first occurrence of a number that appears exactly once in `arr`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not modified by the function, but the internal state of the loop, including the `mpp` dictionary and the `first` flag, is reset for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a` of size `n`. Alice appends the element she picks to a new array `c`, while Bob just removes the element he picks. The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been removed from `a`, assuming both players play optimally. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should always pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` and that appears more than once in `a`. This ensures that Bob cannot immediately pick the same element to prevent Alice from adding it to `c`.
   - **Bob's Strategy**: Bob should pick the smallest element that appears only once in `a` to prevent Alice from adding it to `c`.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `first` to `False`.
   - It iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If `i` is not in the keys of the `Counter` (i.e., `i` does not appear in `arr`), it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This is correct because the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array.
     - If `i` appears exactly once in `arr` and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This is because if `first` is `True`, it means Alice has already picked an element that appears only once, and Bob can now pick the next smallest element that appears only once to minimize the MEX.
     - If `i` appears exactly once in `arr` and `first` is `False`, it sets `first` to `True`. This indicates that Alice has picked the first element that appears only once.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all elements in `arr` appear more than once, the program will correctly print the smallest `i` that is not in `arr`.
   - If all elements in `arr` appear exactly once, the program will correctly print the smallest `i` that is not in `arr` or the smallest `i` that appears exactly once after Alice's first turn.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both players.
   - It handles all edge cases and produces the correct MEX for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
