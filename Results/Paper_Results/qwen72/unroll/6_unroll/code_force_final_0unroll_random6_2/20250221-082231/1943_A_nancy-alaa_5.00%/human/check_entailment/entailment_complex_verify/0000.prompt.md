You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program: 
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
        
    #State: The loop will print the first integer `i` that is either not present in the list `arr` or is present exactly once after the first occurrence of a number that appears exactly once. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` will remain unchanged, but the internal state of the loop, including the `mpp` dictionary and the `first` flag, will be reset for each iteration of the outer loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It then prints the first integer `i` that is either not present in `arr` or is present exactly once after the first occurrence of a number that appears exactly once in `arr`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not modified by the function, but the internal state of the loop, including the `mpp` dictionary and the `first` flag, is reset for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Specifically, the program fails to consider the optimal moves that Bob can make to minimize the MEX of the array `c`.

### Case where the program fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
0 1 2 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

### Explanation of the failure:
- **Initial Array:** `a = [0, 1, 2, 2, 3]`
- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - Alice should pick the element `2` first, making `a = [0, 1, 2, 3]` and `c = [2]`.
  - Bob should pick the element `0`, making `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `c = [2]`.
  - Alice should pick the element `1`, making `a = [2, 3]` and `c = [2, 1]`.
  - Bob should pick the element `2`, making `a = [3]` and `c = [2, 1]`.
  - Alice should pick the element `3`, making `a = []` and `c = [2, 1, 3]`.

At the end, `c = [2, 1, 3]`, and the MEX of `c` is `4`.

However, the provided program does not follow this optimal strategy. It simply checks for the first missing integer and the first unique integer, which does not account for the optimal moves that Bob can make to minimize the MEX.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, both players need to play optimally:
- Alice should always pick the smallest integer that appears an even number of times (or the smallest integer that appears at least once if all integers appear an odd number of times).
- Bob should always pick the smallest integer that appears an odd number of times (or the smallest integer that appears at least once if all integers appear an even number of times).

This ensures that the MEX is maximized for Alice and minimized for Bob. The provided program does not implement this strategy, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
