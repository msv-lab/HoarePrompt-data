Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Specifically, the program fails to consider the optimal moves that Bob can make to minimize the MEX of the array `c`.

### Case where the program fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
0 1 2 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

### Explanation of the failure:
- **Initial Array:** `a = [0, 1, 2, 2, 3]`
- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - Alice should pick the element `2` first, making `a = [0, 1, 2, 3]` and `c = [2]`.
  - Bob should pick the element `0`, making `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `c = [2]`.
  - Alice should pick the element `1`, making `a = [2, 3]` and `c = [2, 1]`.
  - Bob should pick the element `2`, making `a = [3]` and `c = [2, 1]`.
  - Alice should pick the element `3`, making `a = []` and `c = [2, 1, 3]`.

At the end, `c = [2, 1, 3]`, and the MEX of `c` is `4`.

However, the provided program does not follow this optimal strategy. It simply checks for the first missing integer and the first unique integer, which does not account for the optimal moves that Bob can make to minimize the MEX.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, both players need to play optimally:
- Alice should always pick the smallest integer that appears an even number of times (or the smallest integer that appears at least once if all integers appear an odd number of times).
- Bob should always pick the smallest integer that appears an odd number of times (or the smallest integer that appears at least once if all integers appear an even number of times).

This ensures that the MEX is maximized for Alice and minimized for Bob. The provided program does not implement this strategy, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
