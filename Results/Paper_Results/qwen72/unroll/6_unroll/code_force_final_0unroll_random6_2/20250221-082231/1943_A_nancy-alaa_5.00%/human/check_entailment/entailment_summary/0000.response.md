Reasoning:  
The program aims to determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played their optimal moves. The key to solving this problem is understanding the optimal strategies for both players:

- **Alice's Strategy:** She wants to maximize the MEX of `c`. To do this, she should try to include as many distinct integers as possible, especially the smaller ones, because the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- **Bob's Strategy:** He wants to minimize the MEX of `c`. To do this, he should try to remove the smallest integers that Alice hasn't included yet, to force Alice to include larger integers or to leave smaller integers out of `c`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the game, the optimal strategy can be derived by considering the frequency of each integer in the array `a`:

- If an integer `i` appears more than once, Alice can always include it in `c` on her turn, and Bob can also remove it on his turn. This means that both players can effectively ignore these integers when deciding the MEX.
- If an integer `i` appears exactly once, Alice will try to include it in `c` to increase the MEX, and Bob will try to remove it to decrease the MEX. The first such integer that Alice can include will be the MEX of `c` if it is her turn, or the next integer will be the MEX if it is Bob's turn.

The program uses a `Counter` to count the frequency of each integer in `arr`. It then iterates through the integers from 0 to `n-1` and checks the following conditions:
- If `i` is not in the `Counter`, it means `i` is the MEX, and the program prints `i`.
- If `i` is in the `Counter` and appears exactly once, and it is Alice's turn (`first` is `False`), the program prints `i` and breaks.
- If `i` is in the `Counter` and appears exactly once, and it is Bob's turn (`first` is `True`), the program continues to the next integer.

The logic of the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both players. It ensures that the MEX is determined based on the first integer that is either not present or present exactly once after the first occurrence of a number that appears exactly once.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
