### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a` and appending elements to an array `c` (only Alice does this).
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` after the game ends, with Alice trying to maximize it and Bob trying to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the range `[0, n)` to find the first integer `i` that is either not present in the array or is present exactly once after the first occurrence of a number that appears exactly once.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - **Alice's Strategy:** Alice will always choose the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` and is present in `a` at least once, to maximize the MEX.
   - **Bob's Strategy:** Bob will choose the smallest integer that is present in `a` and is not yet in `c`, but only if it is present more than once, to minimize the MEX. If the smallest integer is present only once, Bob will choose the next smallest integer that is present more than once.

4. **Program Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest integer `i` that is not in the array `a` or is present exactly once after the first occurrence of a number that appears exactly once.
   - This logic aligns with the optimal strategy for both players:
     - If `i` is not in `a`, it means `i` is the smallest integer not present, and thus the MEX.
     - If `i` is present exactly once and `first` is `True`, it means Alice has already chosen the first occurrence of a number that appears exactly once, and Bob cannot prevent the MEX from being `i`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where `a` contains all integers from `0` to `n-1` correctly, as it will print `n` (the smallest integer not present).
   - It also handles cases where `a` contains repeated elements correctly, as it will print the smallest integer that is either not present or is present exactly once after the first occurrence of a number that appears exactly once.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob, and it correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
