Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, `n` is the length of `array`.** 

The value of `n` is now the length of the list `array`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 2·10^5. The variable `find` remains an integer within the valid range, and `array` remains unchanged.
