Based on the initial state provided:

- The values of `a` and `b` are overwritten with the last input values from the loop.
- The variable `i` is equal to `t-1`, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- The sum of `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('alice')
```

This statement does not depend on the values of `a`, `b`, or `i`. It simply prints the string `'alice'`.

Output: **alice**
