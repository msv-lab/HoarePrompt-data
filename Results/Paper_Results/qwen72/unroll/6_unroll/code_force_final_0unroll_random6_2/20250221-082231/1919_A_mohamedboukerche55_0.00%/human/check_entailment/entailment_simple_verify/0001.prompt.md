You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function should also be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: The values of `a` and `b` will be overwritten with the last input values for `a` and `b` from the loop, and `i` will be equal to `t-1` (where `t` is the number of test cases). The initial values of `a` and `b` provided before the loop will be lost.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: *The values of `a` and `b` will be overwritten with the last input values for `a` and `b` from the loop, and `i` will be equal to `t-1` (where `t` is the number of test cases). The initial values of `a` and `b` provided before the loop will be lost. Additionally, if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the sum of `a` and `b` is divisible by 2. Otherwise, the sum of `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to either swap wallets or keep their current wallet, followed by removing one coin.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses the game.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game essentially reduces to a parity problem. The total number of coins (a + b) determines the outcome.
   - If the total number of coins is even, the game will end in a situation where both players have an equal number of turns, and the player who starts (Alice) will be the one to make the last move and lose.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, the player who starts (Alice) will have one more turn than Bob, and thus Bob will be the one to make the last move and lose.

3. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It then checks if the sum of the coins (a + b) is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "alice".

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not handle the output correctly for each test case. It only prints the result for the last test case because the `if` statement is outside the loop.
   - The output format is incorrect. It should print "Alice" or "Bob" without extra spaces.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a, b = map(int, s.split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is **incorrect** because it only prints the result for the last test case and the output format is incorrect.
- The corrected program is **correct** as it handles each test case individually and prints the correct output format.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
