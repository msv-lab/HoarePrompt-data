Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The logic used to determine the area is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Method to Calculate Distance**: The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points (n and x) and then compares these values to determine the area. However, this approach does not guarantee that the correct side length of the square is being used.

2. **Assumption of Diagonal Points**: The program assumes that the points (a, b) and (e, f) are one pair of opposite corners, and (c, d) and (g, h) are another pair. This assumption is not always correct because the points are given in random order.

3. **Correct Approach**: To find the area of the square, you need to identify the side length of the square. Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by finding the maximum difference in the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates among the four points. The side length will be the minimum of these two differences (since the square's sides are equal).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract all x and y coordinates
        x_coords = [point[0] for point in points]
        y_coords = [point[1] for point in points]
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = min(max(x_coords) - min(x_coords), max(y_coords) - min(y_coords))
        
        # Calculate and print the area
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version correctly identifies the side length of the square by finding the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates and then calculating the area.
