You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through a predefined method or variable, as the function definition does not specify any parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases, each containing four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each coordinate x_i and y_i is an integer such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        e, f = map(int, input().split())
        
        g, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        
        x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
        
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)
        
    #State: The loop will print the smaller of the two squared distances between the diagonally opposite corners of the square for each test case. After all iterations, the variables `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `n`, and `x` will have their final values based on the last test case processed, but these values are not retained or meaningful outside the loop. The number of test cases `t` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. For example, consider the input where the coordinates of the square are given in a different order:

Input:
```
1
1 1
1 4
4 1
4 4
```

The correct output should be `9` because the side length of the square is `3` (from `1` to `4` on both the x-axis and y-axis), and the area is `3 * 3 = 9`. However, the program calculates the distance between two points and uses the smaller of the two distances to determine the area, which can lead to incorrect results if the points are not in a specific order. In this case, the program will print `1` instead of `9`, which is incorrect.
