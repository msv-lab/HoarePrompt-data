The function `func_4` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It operates on three integer variables `n`, `m`, and `x` that are obtained from the function `func_3`, where `2 <= n <= 1000`, `1 <= m <= 1000`, and `1 <= x <= n`. The function generates a set `ans` of unique integers by performing a series of operations based on values returned by `func_1`. Specifically, for each of the `m` iterations, it adds and subtracts the integer `r` (obtained from `func_1`) to/from each element `q` in `ans`, modulo `n`, and includes the results in `ans` if certain conditions are met. After all iterations, if `0` is present in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added to the set. The function then prints the size of the set `ans` and the sorted elements of `ans`.
