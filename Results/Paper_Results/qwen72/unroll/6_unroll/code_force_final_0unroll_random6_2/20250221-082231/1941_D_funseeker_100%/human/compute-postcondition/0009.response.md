Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print(*sorted(ans))` statement.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is a set containing all unique values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` and for each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`.
- If `0` is in the initial `ans`, `0` is excluded from the set, and `n` is added to `ans`.
- Otherwise, `ans` remains the same as described in the precondition.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial `ans` Set**:
   - The initial `ans` set is not explicitly defined in the precondition, but it is mentioned that it contains values generated by `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` and for each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`.
   - Without knowing the initial values of `ans` or the function `func_1()`, we can't determine the exact values in `ans`.

2. **Modifying `ans`**:
   - If `0` is in the initial `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added to the set.
   - If `0` is not in the initial `ans`, the set remains unchanged.

3. **Sorting and Printing**:
   - The `print(*sorted(ans))` statement will print the elements of the set `ans` sorted in ascending order.

### Final Output:
Since the exact initial values of `ans` and the function `func_1()` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values in the set `ans`. However, based on the given conditions, we can describe the output in a general form.

- If `0` is initially in `ans`, it will be removed, and `n` will be added to the set.
- The final set `ans` will be sorted in ascending order before printing.

Output: **sorted(ans) (where ans is the set containing all unique values generated by the operations (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for each q in the initial ans and for each r and c returned by func_1(), with 0 removed and n added if 0 was initially in ans)**

This description provides the most precise and understandable output based on the given precondition.
