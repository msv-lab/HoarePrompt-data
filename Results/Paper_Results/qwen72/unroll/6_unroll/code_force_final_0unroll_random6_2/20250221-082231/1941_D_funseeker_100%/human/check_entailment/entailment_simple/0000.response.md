### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`, which correctly reads an integer from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`, which correctly splits the input line and converts the parts to integers.
   - It then reads the throw distances and directions using `func_1()`, which correctly reads a line and splits it into `r` and `c`.

2. **Set Initialization:**
   - The set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Throw Simulation:**
   - The program iterates `m` times, simulating each throw.
   - For each throw, it checks the direction `c` and updates the set `ans` accordingly:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the result of `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the result of `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - This correctly accounts for both clockwise and counterclockwise throws, as well as the uncertainty when `c` is '?'.

4. **Set Update:**
   - After processing each throw, the set `ans` is updated to `temp`. This ensures that `ans` always contains the possible positions of the ball after the current throw.

5. **Adjustment for Player Numbering:**
   - The program checks if `0` is in `ans` and, if so, removes `0` and adds `n`. This is necessary because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and a result of `0` from the modulo operation should be adjusted to `n`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball and then prints the sorted list of these players. This is correct according to the problem statement.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws, considering the given constraints and the uncertainty in the direction of some throws. The input handling, throw simulation, and output are all consistent with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
