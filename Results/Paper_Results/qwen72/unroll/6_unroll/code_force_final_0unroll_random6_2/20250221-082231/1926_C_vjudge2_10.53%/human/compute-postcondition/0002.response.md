The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.

Since `t` is already stated to be between 1 and 10^4, it inherently ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state does not need to be modified to ensure the loop executes, as `t` being between 1 and 10^4 is sufficient.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 Â· 10^5 for each test case, `numbers` is an empty list**
