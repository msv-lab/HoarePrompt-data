Output State: **`t` remains an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` remains an integer between 1 and 2 · 10^5 for the last test case, `numbers` remains a list containing `t` integers, each between 1 and 2 · 10^5, `values` is a list where the first 10 elements are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and the subsequent elements up to index `n` are calculated based on the loop logic, `sum_values` is a list where the first 10 elements are [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45] and the subsequent elements up to index `n` are calculated based on the loop logic, and `total` is 45.**
