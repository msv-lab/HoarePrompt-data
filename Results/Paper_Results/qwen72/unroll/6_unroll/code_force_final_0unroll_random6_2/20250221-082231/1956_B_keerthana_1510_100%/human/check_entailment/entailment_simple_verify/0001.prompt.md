You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most 2 times in the list. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
        
    #State: The values of t, n, and a remain unchanged. The loop iterates through the input lines, processing every third line starting from the third line. For each processed line, it calculates and prints the difference between the number of tokens in the line and the number of unique tokens. The state of t, n, and a is not affected by the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves a card game where two players, you and Nene, take turns placing cards on a table. The goal is to maximize your score, which is the number of times you place a card that matches a card already on the table. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Input Parsing**: The program reads input from stdin, which is a common practice for competitive programming problems. It processes the input in a specific way:
   - The first line contains the number of test cases `t`.
   - Each test case has two lines: the first line contains `n`, and the second line contains the integers on your cards.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program iterates over every second line starting from the third line (i.e., the lines containing the integers on your cards).
   - It splits the line into tokens (which are the integers on your cards).
   - It calculates the number of points you can get by subtracting the number of unique integers from the total number of integers.

4. **Logic Explanation**:
   - `len(tokens)` gives the total number of cards in your hand.
   - `len({*tokens})` gives the number of unique integers in your hand.
   - The difference `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` gives the number of integers that appear more than once in your hand. This is because each unique integer can only appear once on the table to score a point, and any additional occurrence of the same integer will score a point.

5. **Optimal Play**:
   - The logic assumes that you will always place a card that matches a card already on the table if possible, and Nene will play optimally to minimize your points.
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score by counting the duplicates in your hand, as each duplicate can potentially score a point.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of points you can score.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem by identifying the number of duplicates in your hand, which is the maximum number of points you can score if Nene plays optimally.
