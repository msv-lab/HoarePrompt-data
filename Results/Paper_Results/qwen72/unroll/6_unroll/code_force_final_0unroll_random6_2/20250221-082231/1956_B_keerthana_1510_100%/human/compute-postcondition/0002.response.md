The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most 2 times in the list. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters. However, the specific output is not provided in the problem statement. Given the constraints and the typical nature of such problems, the function likely returns some form of analysis or computation on the list `a` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information.**
