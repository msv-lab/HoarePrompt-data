The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder used to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body, and it starts from 0 by default when the loop begins.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
