You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. Based on the problem description, the function should take a list of integers `a` as input, where `a` is a beautiful array, and an integer `n` representing the length of the array `a` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5). Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, which implies that it might need to take an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, the array `a` and its length `n`. However, the function definition should be corrected to include these parameters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        tmp = a[0]
        
        cnt = 0
        
        ans = n
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
        if n == 1 or ans == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, each time processing a list of integers `a` of length `n`. For each test case, the loop will print either `-1` if `n` is 1 or if all elements in `a` are the same, or the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element in `a`. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` will have been updated according to the logic of the loop, but their final values will depend on the input provided during the execution.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It returns the result for each test case based on the input parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
