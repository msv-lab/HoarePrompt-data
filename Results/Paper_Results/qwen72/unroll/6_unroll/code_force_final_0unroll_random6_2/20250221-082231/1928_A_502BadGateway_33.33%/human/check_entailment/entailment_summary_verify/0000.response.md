Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the provided program. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is insufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. The problem description states that Bob can cut the rectangle parallel to one of its sides, meaning either `a` or `b` can be the dimension that is cut. Therefore, the program should check if either `a` or `b` is even, as cutting an even dimension will always allow forming a different rectangle.

For example:
- For the input `4 3`, the program will output "no" because `b` (3) is odd. However, `a` (4) is even, and the rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a 6x2 rectangle, different from the original 4x3 rectangle.
- Similarly, for the input `3 4`, the program will output "yes" because `b` (4) is even, but it should also output "yes" for the input `4 3` for the same reason.

The function `func_1` needs to be modified to check if either `a` or `b` is even, not just `b`.

Final: **False**
