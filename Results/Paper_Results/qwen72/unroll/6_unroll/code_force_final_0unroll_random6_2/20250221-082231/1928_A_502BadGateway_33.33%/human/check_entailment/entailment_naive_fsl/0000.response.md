Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, but it does not consider the case where `a` is even and `b` is odd, which can also result in forming a different rectangle. For example, for the input `4 3`, the program will output "no", but it should output "yes" because a 4x3 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, and these can be used to form a 6x2 rectangle, which is different from the original 4x3 rectangle. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
