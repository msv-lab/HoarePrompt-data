Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes in five parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), `PB` (an integer between 1 and n), `PS` (an integer between 1 and n), `p` (a list of integers representing a permutation of length n), and `a` (a list of integers of length n, each element in the range 1 to 10^9). It calculates the scores for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their respective positions `PB` and `PS` using the `calculate_score` function. The function returns 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is greater than Sasha's score, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is greater than Bodya's score, and 'Draw' if both scores are equal. **
