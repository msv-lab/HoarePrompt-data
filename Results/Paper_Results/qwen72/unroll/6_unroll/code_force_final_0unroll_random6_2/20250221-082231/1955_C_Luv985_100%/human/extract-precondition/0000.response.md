Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: t, a list of pairs (n, k), and a list of lists a. t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each pair (n, k) in the list of pairs represents the number of ships (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and the number of Kraken attacks (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15). Each list in a contains n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the durability of the ships. The length of the list a should match the number of test cases t, and each sublist in a should correspond to the n in the respective test case. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
