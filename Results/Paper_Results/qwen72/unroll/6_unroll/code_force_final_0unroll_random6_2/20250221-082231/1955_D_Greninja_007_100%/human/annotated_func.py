#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6.

    #State: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted first m elements of list `a`, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common elements between the first m elements of `a` and `b`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

    #State: `n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same. `a` and `b` remain the same. `cb` remains the same. `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted last `m` elements of list `a`. `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common elements between the last `m` elements of `a` and `b`. `ans` is the number of windows of size `m` in `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of common elements between the window and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of windows of size `m` in list `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of common elements between the window and list `b` is greater than or equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It returns the number of contiguous subarrays (windows) of size `m` in the list `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of common elements between the subarray and the list `b` is greater than or equal to `k`. The input lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the function does not modify any global state.
