Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it updates the `sm` variable, which is supposed to keep track of the number of matching elements between the current subsegment of `a` and `b`. Specifically, the logic for updating `sm` when sliding the window over the array `a` is incorrect. Here is the problematic part:

```python
if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
    sm += 1
ca[a[r]] += 1
if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
    sm -= 1
ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
```

This logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the changes in the number of matching elements when the window slides. The correct way to update `sm` should be:

1. Subtract the contribution of the element that is leaving the window.
2. Add the contribution of the element that is entering the window.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(b)
    ca = Counter(a[:m])
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    for r in range(m, n):
        # Subtract the contribution of the element that is leaving the window
        if ca[a[r - m]] > 0 and ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1

        # Add the contribution of the element that is entering the window
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        ca[a[r]] += 1

        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    return ans
```

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
7 4 3
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4
```

The correct output should be `3` because the subsegments starting at positions 1, 2, and 3 are good. However, the given program will output `4`, which is incorrect.

### Explanation of the Example Case:
- Subsegment starting at position 1: `[4, 1, 2, 3]` (3 matches with `b`)
- Subsegment starting at position 2: `[1, 2, 3, 4]` (4 matches with `b`)
- Subsegment starting at position 3: `[2, 3, 4, 5]` (3 matches with `b`)
- Subsegment starting at position 4: `[3, 4, 5, 6]` (2 matches with `b`)

The program incorrectly counts the subsegment starting at position 4 as good, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
