Output State: **The function `func` will print the permutations for each test case, where each permutation is a sequence of integers from 1 to n rearranged such that the even indices (0-based) contain the largest even numbers in descending order, and the odd indices contain the smallest odd numbers in ascending order. The loop will have completed all iterations, and the variables `i` and `n` will be in their final states after the last test case. The list `p` will be the last permutation generated, and `ind` will be the last value used for filling the permutation. The initial state of the function and the structure of the loop remain unchanged.**
