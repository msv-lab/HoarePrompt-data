### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a permutation `p` of length `n` such that for any two distinct indices `i` and `j` (where \(1 \leq i, j < n\) and \(i \neq j\)), the conditions \(p_i \nmid p_j\) and \(p_{i+1} \nmid p_{j+1}\) hold.
   - This means that no two elements at even indices should divide each other, and no two elements at odd indices should divide each other.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and initializes a list `p` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the even indices of `p` with the largest even numbers in descending order.
   - After that, it fills the odd indices of `p` with the smallest odd numbers in ascending order.

3. **Checking the Permutation:**
   - The program ensures that the permutation `p` contains all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once.
   - The even indices are filled with large even numbers, and the odd indices are filled with small odd numbers. This ensures that no two elements at even indices can divide each other, and no two elements at odd indices can divide each other.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For \( n = 4 \):
     - The permutation generated is `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.
     - Even indices: `4` and `2` (neither divides the other).
     - Odd indices: `1` and `3` (neither divides the other).
   - For \( n = 3 \):
     - The permutation generated is `[1, 2, 3]`.
     - Even indices: `1` (no other even index to compare).
     - Odd indices: `2` and `3` (neither divides the other).

5. **General Case Verification:**
   - For any \( n \), the program ensures that the even indices are filled with the largest even numbers in descending order, and the odd indices are filled with the smallest odd numbers in ascending order.
   - This pattern guarantees that no two elements at even indices will divide each other, and no two elements at odd indices will divide each other.

### Function Summary:
- The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of a permutation `p`.
- For each test case, it generates and prints a permutation of integers from 1 to `n` such that even indices (0-based) contain the largest even numbers in descending order, and odd indices contain the smallest odd numbers in ascending order.
- After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final state includes the last permutation `p` generated and the last value of `ind` used for filling the permutation.
- The function does not return any value.

### Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the problem requirements and the program's approach to generating the permutation.
- The program's logic for filling even and odd indices with the largest even numbers in descending order and the smallest odd numbers in ascending order, respectively, is sound.
- This approach ensures that no two elements at even indices will divide each other, and no two elements at odd indices will divide each other, meeting the problem's constraints.
- The examples provided in the assessment and the function summary are consistent with the program's behavior.

### Final:
**True**

The program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.
