Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and the value of `n` for each test case. It processes each test case in a loop, which is appropriate for the problem description.

2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - The function initializes a list `p` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the even indices (0-based) with the largest even numbers in descending order.
   - It fills the odd indices (0-based) with the smallest odd numbers in ascending order.

3. **Constraints and Output**:
   - The function ensures that the permutation `p` is of length `n` and contains all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once.
   - The permutation is generated such that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) exist where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`. This is achieved by placing the largest even numbers in even indices and the smallest odd numbers in odd indices, which inherently avoids the divisibility condition for adjacent pairs.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the minimum value of `n` (3) correctly.
   - The function also handles the maximum value of `n` (10^5) within the constraints, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

5. **Final State**:
   - The function prints the permutations for each test case as required.
   - The final state of the function is as described in the comments, with the last permutation `p` generated and the last value of `ind` used for filling the permutation.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
