Output State: The function `func` processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it generates and prints a permutation `p` of length `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The permutation `p` is constructed such that the even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are filled with the largest odd numbers in descending order, and the odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) are filled with the smallest even numbers in ascending order. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. After all iterations of the loop, the function has printed the permutations for all test cases, and the loop variable `i` in the outer loop has reached the value of the number of test cases. The internal variables `n`, `p`, and `ind` are reset and used for each test case, so they do not retain any specific final value across test cases.
