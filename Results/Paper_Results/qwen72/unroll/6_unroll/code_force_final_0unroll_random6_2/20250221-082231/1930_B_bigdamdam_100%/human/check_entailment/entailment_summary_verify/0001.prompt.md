You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        print(*p)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of a permutation `p`. For each test case, it generates and prints a permutation of integers from 1 to `n` such that even indices (0-based) contain the largest even numbers in descending order, and odd indices contain the smallest odd numbers in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final state includes the last permutation `p` generated and the last value of `ind` used for filling the permutation. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a permutation `p` of length `n` such that for any two distinct indices `i` and `j` (where \(1 \leq i, j < n\) and \(i \neq j\)), the conditions \(p_i \nmid p_j\) and \(p_{i+1} \nmid p_{j+1}\) hold.
   - This means that no two elements at even indices should divide each other, and no two elements at odd indices should divide each other.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and initializes a list `p` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the even indices of `p` with the largest odd numbers in descending order.
   - After that, it fills the odd indices of `p` with the smallest odd numbers in ascending order.

3. **Checking the Permutation:**
   - The program ensures that the permutation `p` contains all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once.
   - The even indices are filled with large odd numbers, and the odd indices are filled with small odd numbers. This ensures that no two elements at even indices can divide each other, and no two elements at odd indices can divide each other.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For \( n = 4 \):
     - The permutation generated is `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.
     - Even indices: `4` and `2` (neither divides the other).
     - Odd indices: `1` and `3` (neither divides the other).
   - For \( n = 3 \):
     - The permutation generated is `[1, 2, 3]`.
     - Even indices: `1` (no other even index to compare).
     - Odd indices: `2` and `3` (neither divides the other).

5. **General Case Verification:**
   - For any \( n \), the program ensures that the even indices are filled with the largest odd numbers in descending order, and the odd indices are filled with the smallest odd numbers in ascending order.
   - This pattern guarantees that no two elements at even indices will divide each other, and no two elements at odd indices will divide each other.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a permutation `p` that meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
