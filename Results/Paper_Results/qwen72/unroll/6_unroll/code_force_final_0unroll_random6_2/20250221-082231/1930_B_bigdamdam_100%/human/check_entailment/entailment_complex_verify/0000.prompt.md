You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        print(*p)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the permutation p. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        
        p = [0] * n
        
        ind = n
        
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: The function `func` will print the permutations for each test case, where each permutation is a sequence of integers from 1 to n rearranged such that the even indices (0-based) contain the largest even numbers in descending order, and the odd indices contain the smallest odd numbers in ascending order. The loop will have completed all iterations, and the variables `i` and `n` will be in their final states after the last test case. The list `p` will be the last permutation generated, and `ind` will be the last value used for filling the permutation. The initial state of the function and the structure of the loop remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of a permutation `p`. For each test case, it generates and prints a permutation of integers from 1 to `n` such that even indices (0-based) contain the largest even numbers in descending order, and odd indices contain the smallest odd numbers in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final state includes the last permutation `p` generated and the last value of `ind` used for filling the permutation. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program constructs a permutation `p` of length `n` such that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) exist where `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]`. The approach used in the program is to place the largest numbers in the even indices and the smallest numbers in the odd indices, which ensures that the conditions are met. This is because the largest numbers are placed in a way that they do not consecutively follow each other, and the smallest numbers are placed in a way that they do not consecutively follow each other either. This strategy prevents the formation of pairs where both elements in the pair can divide the corresponding elements in another pair. Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly.
