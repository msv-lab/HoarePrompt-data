Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of a permutation `p`. For each test case, it generates and prints a permutation of integers from 1 to `n` such that even indices (0-based) contain the largest even numbers in descending order, and odd indices contain the smallest odd numbers in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final state includes the last permutation `p` generated and the last value of `ind` used for filling the permutation. The function does not return any value. **
