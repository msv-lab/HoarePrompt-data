You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

Example

Input

    06:06 PM
    12:14 PM
    12:59 AM
    12:00 AM
    02:34 PM

    09:37 PM

- Program: 
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'PM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'PM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'AM'
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
        
    #State: The values of `t`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `day` will be 'PM' if the loop runs at least once and the hour `h` is not 12. If the hour `h` is 12, `day` will be 'AM'. The loop prints the time in 12-hour format with the corresponding AM/PM value for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the transition between AM and PM. Specifically, the logic for setting `day` to 'AM' or 'PM' is incorrect. For example, when the input is "12:14", the program will output "12:14 PM" instead of "12:14 PM" as expected. The issue lies in the following block:

```python
else:
    day = 'PM'
    if h == 12:
        day = 'AM'
```

This block incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' for all hours between 1 and 11, and then changes it back to 'AM' if the hour is 12. This results in incorrect output for times like "12:14" and "00:59". The correct logic should be:

```python
if h == 0:
    h = 12
    day = 'AM'
elif h == 12:
    day = 'PM'
elif h > 12:
    h = h - 12
    day = 'PM'
else:
    day = 'AM'
```
