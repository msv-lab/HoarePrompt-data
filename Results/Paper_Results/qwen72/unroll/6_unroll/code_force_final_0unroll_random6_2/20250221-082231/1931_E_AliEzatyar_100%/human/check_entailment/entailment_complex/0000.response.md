### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - It initializes an array `answers` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `m`, and the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list `array` by summing the lengths of each string representation of the integers.
   - It uses the function `func_1` to count the number of trailing zeros in each integer and stores these counts in the list `zeros`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of an integer.
   - It iterates from the end of the string and increments a counter until it encounters a non-zero digit.

4. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - The program sorts the list `zeros` in descending order.
   - It then calculates the total number of trailing zeros to be subtracted by summing every second element in the sorted `zeros` list.
   - The logic behind this is to simulate the optimal play where Sasha can concatenate the numbers in a way that maximizes the number of digits, and Anna can reverse the numbers to minimize the number of digits.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between the total number of digits and the subtracted trailing zeros is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If this condition is met, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Issue with `func_1` Function:**
  - The function `func_1` is supposed to count trailing zeros in a single integer, not in a list of integers.
  - The function should be called with each individual integer in the list, not the entire list.
  - The comment in the function is incorrect. It should state that `counter` is the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of the integer `num`.

- **Correct Function Call:**
  - The function `func_1` should be called with each integer in the list `array` as a string, not the entire list.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter
```

### Correctness:
- The program is almost correct, but the function `func_1` is called incorrectly.
- After correcting the function call, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
- The function `func_1` is called with each integer in the list `array` as a string, which is correct.
- However, the comment in the function and the overall description of the function are incorrect, which could lead to confusion.
- The logic for determining the winner is based on the correct understanding of the game, but the implementation of the function call needs to be fixed.

### Final Corrected Program:
```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter
```

Correctness: **True** after fixing the function call and comments.
