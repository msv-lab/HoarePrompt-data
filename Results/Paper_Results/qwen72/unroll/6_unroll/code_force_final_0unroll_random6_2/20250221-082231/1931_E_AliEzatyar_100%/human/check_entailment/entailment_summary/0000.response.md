### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The game involves two players, Anna and Sasha, taking turns on a list of integers.
   - Anna reverses the digits of a chosen integer.
   - Sasha concatenates two integers and inserts the result back into the list.
   - The game ends when there is only one integer left, and Sasha wins if this integer is at least \(10^m\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of integers) and `m` (the threshold for Sasha's win).
   - It then reads the list of integers `array`.
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list `total_digits`.
   - It also calculates the number of trailing zeros in each integer using the function `func_1` and stores these values in the list `zeros`.
   - The `zeros` list is sorted in descending order.
   - The program then calculates `subtract_zero` by summing every second element in the sorted `zeros` list.
   - Finally, it checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If so, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` takes a string `num` and returns the number of trailing zeros in `num`.
   - This function is correctly implemented and returns the expected result.

4. **Logic of the Program**:
   - The program aims to determine the winner based on the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros.
   - The idea is that trailing zeros can be removed by Sasha's concatenation, and the remaining digits should be considered.
   - The program calculates the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros that can be removed in pairs.
   - The condition `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` is used to determine if the remaining number of digits is sufficient for Sasha to win.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not explicitly reverse the digits of the integers as Anna's move, but it calculates the number of trailing zeros, which is a key factor in determining the outcome.
   - The logic of summing every second element in the sorted `zeros` list is based on the assumption that Sasha can remove pairs of trailing zeros optimally.
   - The condition `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` is a heuristic to determine the winner, but it needs to be verified if it correctly captures the game's dynamics.

6. **Verification**:
   - The program's logic seems to align with the problem's requirements, especially considering the optimal play.
   - The provided execution summary and the example test cases suggest that the program is producing the correct results.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly implemented and follows the logic required to determine the winner based on the given problem description and test cases.

**Correctness: True**
