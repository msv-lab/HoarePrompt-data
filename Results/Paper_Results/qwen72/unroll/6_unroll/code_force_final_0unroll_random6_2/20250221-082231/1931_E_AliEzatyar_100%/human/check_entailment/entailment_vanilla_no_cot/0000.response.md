Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to count the trailing zeros in a number. However, the program incorrectly uses this function to determine the number of digits to subtract from the total digit count. This is not the correct approach for solving the problem.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list and then subtracts the sum of the trailing zeros (in pairs) from this total. This logic does not correctly simulate the game's rules.
   - The game involves reversing digits and concatenating numbers, which can significantly change the values and the number of digits in the final number. The program does not account for these operations.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy**:
   - The program does not consider the optimal play strategy for both players. For example, Anna can reverse the digits to make the number smaller, and Sasha can concatenate numbers to make the number larger. The program does not simulate these strategies correctly.

### Correct Approach:

To determine the winner, we need to consider the following:

- **Anna's Move**: Anna can reverse any number in the list. Reversing a number can change its value but not the number of digits (except for trailing zeros).
- **Sasha's Move**: Sasha can concatenate any two numbers in the list, which will always increase the number of digits in the list.
- **Winning Condition**: Sasha wins if the final number has at least \(10^m\) digits. Otherwise, Anna wins.

The key observation is that if the total number of digits in the list is at least \(m + 1\) after all possible optimal moves, Sasha will win. Otherwise, Anna will win.

### Corrected Program:

```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the total number of digits in the list
    total_digits = sum(len(str(item)) for item in array)
    
    # If the total number of digits is at least m + 1, Sasha wins
    if total_digits >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
- **Total Digits Calculation**: It calculates the total number of digits in the list by converting each number to a string and summing the lengths.
- **Winning Condition**: It checks if the total number of digits is at least \(m + 1\). If so, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

This approach correctly simulates the game's rules and determines the winner based on the total number of digits in the list.
