The loop head involves the variables `i` and `num`. The loop is designed to iterate over the range from `len(num) - 1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1. For the loop to execute, `len(num)` must be greater than 0, which means `num` must be a list with at least one element. However, the initial state describes `num` as an integer, not a list. Therefore, `num` needs to be adjusted to be a list with at least one element.

State: **`num` is a list of integers representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 10^4. Each element in `num` represents a test case and consists of two integers n and m, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^6, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. `counter` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`**
