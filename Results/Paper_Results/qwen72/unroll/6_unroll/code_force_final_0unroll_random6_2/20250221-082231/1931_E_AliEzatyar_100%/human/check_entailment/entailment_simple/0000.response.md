### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m` and the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting**:
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list of integers by iterating over each item in `array` and summing the lengths of the strings representing these integers. This is correct because the length of the string representation of an integer is the number of digits in that integer.

3. **Trailing Zeros**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of trailing zeros in a given integer represented as a string. This function is used to identify and store the number of trailing zeros for each integer in the list `array` that has trailing zeros.
   - The function correctly iterates from the end of the string and counts the trailing zeros until a non-zero digit is encountered.

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - The program then sorts the list of trailing zeros in descending order and calculates the total number of trailing zeros to be subtracted from the total digit count. This is done by summing every second element in the sorted list of trailing zeros.
   - The logic behind this is to simulate the optimal play where Anna and Sasha can use trailing zeros to their advantage. Anna can reverse numbers to reduce the number of trailing zeros, and Sasha can concatenate numbers to maximize the number of digits.

5. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between the total number of digits and the sum of trailing zeros is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.
   - The condition `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` is used to determine if the final number can be made to have at least `m` digits, which is the winning condition for Sasha.

### Issues:
- **Function Call and List Handling**:
  - The function `func_1` is called with a string representation of the integer, which is correct.
  - However, the list `zeros` is being used to store the number of trailing zeros for each integer, but it is not clear why only the number of trailing zeros is being stored and not the actual integers. This might be a simplification, but it should be verified if this approach correctly simulates the game's optimal play.

- **Trailing Zeros Calculation**:
  - The function `func_1` correctly counts trailing zeros, but the logic of summing every second element in the sorted list of trailing zeros might not be optimal. The optimal play might involve more complex strategies, but for the given problem, this approach seems to be a reasonable heuristic.

- **Output**:
  - The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to follow the correct logic for determining the winner based on the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros. However, the approach of summing every second element in the sorted list of trailing zeros might be a simplification that could be incorrect in some edge cases. Given the problem constraints and the provided test cases, the program seems to work correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
