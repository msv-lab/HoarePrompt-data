Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function then calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list `a` to make it either a single element or a list where all elements are the same. The result for each test case is printed to the output. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state is that all test cases have been processed and their results printed. **
