### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements `num`.

2. **Initial Check for All Elements Being Equal:**
   - The function checks if all elements in the array are already equal by iterating through the array and comparing adjacent elements.
   - If all elements are equal or the array has only one element, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because no operation is needed to make all elements equal.

3. **Calculating the Longest Prefix and Suffix of Equal Elements:**
   - The function calculates the length of the longest prefix of equal elements (`cn`) and the length of the longest suffix of equal elements (`ck`).
   - It does this by iterating from the start and the end of the array, respectively, and counting the number of consecutive equal elements.

4. **Combining Prefix and Suffix:**
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it adds the lengths of the prefix and suffix (`cn + ck`).
   - This is done to account for the possibility that the longest segment of equal elements could be a combination of the prefix and suffix.

5. **Output the Minimum Cost:**
   - The function prints `n - max(cn, ck)` as the result for each test case.
   - This is the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make all elements equal, which is the cost in burles.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic of the function is to find the longest segment of equal elements that can be extended to cover the entire array with the minimum cost.
- The cost is calculated as the total number of elements minus the length of the longest segment of equal elements.
- This approach is correct because the minimum cost to make all elements equal is achieved by changing the fewest number of elements, which is equivalent to keeping the longest segment of equal elements and changing the rest.

### Potential Issues:
- The function assumes that the longest segment of equal elements can be extended to cover the entire array. This is a valid assumption given the problem constraints.
- The function correctly handles the case where the array is already uniform or has only one element.
- The function also correctly handles the case where the longest segment can be a combination of the prefix and suffix.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given problem description and the logic implemented. It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for each test case.
