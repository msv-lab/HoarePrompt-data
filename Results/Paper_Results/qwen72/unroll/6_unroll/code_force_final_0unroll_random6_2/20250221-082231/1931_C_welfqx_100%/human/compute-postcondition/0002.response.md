Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` is decremented to 0, and the variables `n` and `num` are updated for each test case based on the input. The variables `f`, `onum`, `cn`, `ck`, `symb1`, and `symb2` are used within the loop to perform the necessary calculations and are reset for each test case. The output for each test case is printed, which is the result of `n - max(cn, ck)`.**
