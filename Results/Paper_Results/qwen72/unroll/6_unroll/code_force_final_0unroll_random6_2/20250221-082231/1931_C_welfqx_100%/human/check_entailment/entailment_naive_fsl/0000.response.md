Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the array has multiple distinct elements, and the optimal solution involves selecting a value that is not the first or last element of the array. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`. The optimal solution would be to select `i = 1, j = 4, x = 2`, which would result in the array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` with a cost of 5 burles. However, the program will output `3` because it only considers the longest prefix and suffix of the same value, which in this case are both of length 1. Thus, the program does not find the optimal solution for this case.
