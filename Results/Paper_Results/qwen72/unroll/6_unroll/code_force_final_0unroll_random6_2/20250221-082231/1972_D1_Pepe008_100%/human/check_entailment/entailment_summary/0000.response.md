### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Loop and Calculation**:
   - The function iterates over `i` from 1 to `b` (inclusive).
   - It calculates `x` using the formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
   - It checks if `x` is greater than 0 and adds it to `suma`.
   - It then checks if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) and adds 1 to `suma` if both conditions are true.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints `suma - 2` for each test case.

4. **Problem Conditions**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

5. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is used to count the number of valid `a` values for a given `b` (represented by `i` in the loop).
   - The condition \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) ensures that `a` and `b` satisfy the divisibility condition.
   - The condition \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) is always false for \(i > 1\) because \(i \cdot (i - 1)\) is not divisible by \(i^2\) (since \(i - 1\) is not divisible by \(i\)).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \(i = 1\), the condition \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) is true because \(1 \cdot 0 \% 1 == 0\), but this is the only case where it holds.
   - The subtraction of 2 at the end is not justified by the problem statement and seems to be an error.

7. **Correctness**:
   - The formula and conditions used in the loop are not correctly aligned with the problem requirements.
   - The subtraction of 2 at the end is incorrect and will lead to wrong results for many test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The formula and conditions used are not aligned with the problem requirements, and the final subtraction of 2 is incorrect.
