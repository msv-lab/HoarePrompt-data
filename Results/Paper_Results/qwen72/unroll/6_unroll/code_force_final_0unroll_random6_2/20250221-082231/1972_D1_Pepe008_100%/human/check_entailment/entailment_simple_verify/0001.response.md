### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), it must be true that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - This can be rewritten as \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot d\) where \(d = \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot d\), which implies \(a = k \cdot b \cdot d - b\).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values that satisfy the condition.
   - The formula used in the program is \(x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\), where \(i\) is the current value of \(b\).

4. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula \(x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\) is not derived from the condition \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The correct approach should be to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each \(a\) and \(b\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program subtracts 2 from the final sum, which is not explained in the reasoning and seems arbitrary.
   - The program does not handle the case where \(a\) and \(b\) are both 1 correctly. It should only count the pair \((1, 1)\) once, but the formula and the subtraction might be causing issues.

6. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The formula used in the program is not derived correctly from the problem statement.
   - The arbitrary subtraction of 2 at the end is not justified and may lead to incorrect results.
   - The program does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program right before the function call**: \(n\) and \(m\) are positive integers such that \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).
- **State of the program after reading the number of test cases**: \(T\) is the number of test cases.
- **State of the program after reading each test case**: \(a\) and \(b\) are the values for the current test case.
- **State of the program inside the loop**:
  - The loop iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
  - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \(x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\).
  - If \(x > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
  - It then checks if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\), and if both conditions are true, it adds 1 to `suma`.
- **State of the program after the loop**: The value of `suma` is printed after subtracting 2.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The formula used is incorrect, and the arbitrary subtraction of 2 at the end is not justified and may lead to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
