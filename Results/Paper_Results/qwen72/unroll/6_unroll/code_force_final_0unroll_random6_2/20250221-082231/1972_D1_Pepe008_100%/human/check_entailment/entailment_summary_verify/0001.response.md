### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), it must be true that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - This can be rewritten as \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot d\) where \(d = \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(a = k \cdot b \cdot d - b\).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values that satisfy the condition.
   - The formula used in the program is \(x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\), where \(i\) is the current value of \(b\).

4. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula \(x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\) is not derived from the correct condition \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The correct approach should involve checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) directly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program subtracts 2 from the final sum, which is not explained in the reasoning and seems arbitrary.
   - The program does not handle the case where \(a\) and \(b\) are both 1 correctly. It should only count the pair \((1, 1)\) once, but the formula and the subtraction might be causing issues.

6. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The formula used in the program is not derived correctly from the problem statement.
   - The arbitrary subtraction of 2 at the end is not justified and may lead to incorrect results.
   - The program does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The formula used is incorrect, and the arbitrary subtraction of 2 at the end is not justified.

Final: **False**
