Output State: **The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `T` is decremented by the number of iterations the loop has executed. For each iteration of the loop, the value of `suma` is calculated and printed, but `suma` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration. Therefore, the final value of `suma` after the loop finishes is 0.**
