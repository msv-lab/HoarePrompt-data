Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The main issue lies in the calculation of the variable `x` and the subsequent conditions used to update `suma`. The logic used to determine the number of valid pairs is flawed. Specifically:

1. The calculation of `x`:
   ```python
   x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
   ```
   This formula is not derived from the problem statement and does not correctly count the valid pairs.

2. The condition:
   ```python
   if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
       suma += x
       if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
           suma += 1
   ```
   This condition is also not correct and does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. The final adjustment:
   ```python
   print(suma - 2)
   ```
   Subtracting 2 from `suma` is not justified by the problem statement and can lead to incorrect results.

To verify the correctness, let's consider a simple test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), and \((2, 1)\).

**Actual Output:**
The program will produce an incorrect result because the logic for counting valid pairs is flawed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
