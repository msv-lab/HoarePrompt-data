The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might internally use or rely on two positive integers, `n` and `m`, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function returns a value or values based on these integers, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints.

Since the exact output is not specified, I can only describe the parameters and the general context in which the function operates.

Functionality: **The function operates with two positive integers, `n` and `m`, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The specific return value or values are not provided in the constraints.**
