You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

    6 4
    1 3
    1 2
    1 2
    5 1 3 3
    6 4 2 4
    
Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: The list `a` remains unchanged. The variables `l` and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the corresponding integer in `a` has been fully processed or not. The variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are integers representing the number of elements processed in the respective parts of the loop. The list `res` contains the integers that were printed in the second part of the loop, if any.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a list `a` of integers of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. It prints pairs of integers from the first half of `a` until `k` pairs are printed or all pairs are exhausted. If more pairs are needed, it prints single integers from the first half of `a` until the required number of elements is printed. Finally, it prints pairs of integers from the second half of `a` to balance the number of printed elements from both halves. The list `a` remains unchanged, and no value is returned.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from meeting the problem description correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `l` and `r` Arrays**:
   - The arrays `l` and `r` are initialized with a length of `n`, but they should be initialized with a length of `2k` since the output arrays need to contain exactly `2k` elements.

2. **Incorrect Handling of `ul` and `ur`**:
   - The variables `ul` and `ur` are used to track the number of elements added to the arrays `l` and `r`, respectively. However, the program does not correctly ensure that `ul` and `ur` are both equal to `2k` before printing the results. This can lead to cases where the output arrays do not have the required length.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Filling `l` and `r`**:
   - The program attempts to fill `l` and `r` by checking the counts of elements in the first half and the second half of the array `a`. However, the logic for filling `r` is flawed. The program does not correctly ensure that the elements in `r` are taken from the second half of the array `a`.

4. **Potential Infinite Loop**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the elements in the first half and the second half of the array `a` do not match the required counts. This can lead to an infinite loop or incorrect output.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

The expected output should be:
```
1 2
1 2
```

However, the program will output:
```
1 2
1 2
```

But if we consider a different input:
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1
```

The expected output should be:
```
1 2
1 2
```

But the program will output:
```
1 2
1 2
```

This is incorrect because the elements in `r` should be taken from the second half of the array `a`, and the program does not ensure this.

### Corrected Program:
To correct the program, we need to ensure that the arrays `l` and `r` are correctly initialized and filled with elements from the appropriate halves of the array `a`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        # Initialize l and r with the correct length
        l = [0] * (2 * k)
        r = [0] * (2 * k)
        
        # Track the number of elements added to l and r
        ul = ur = 0
        
        # Create a dictionary to track the indices of each element
        indices = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
        for i in range(2 * n):
            indices[a[i]].append(i)
        
        # Fill l and r with elements from the first and second halves
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if len(indices[i]) == 2:
                if ul < 2 * k and indices[i][0] < n:
                    l[ul] = a[indices[i][0]]
                    ul += 1
                if ul < 2 * k and indices[i][1] < n:
                    l[ul] = a[indices[i][1]]
                    ul += 1
                if ur < 2 * k and indices[i][0] >= n:
                    r[ur] = a[indices[i][0]]
                    ur += 1
                if ur < 2 * k and indices[i][1] >= n:
                    r[ur] = a[indices[i][1]]
                    ur += 1
        
        # Ensure l and r have exactly 2k elements
        if ul < 2 * k:
            for i in range(1, n + 1):
                if ul < 2 * k and indices[i][0] < n:
                    l[ul] = a[indices[i][0]]
                    ul += 1
                if ul < 2 * k and indices[i][1] < n:
                    l[ul] = a[indices[i][1]]
                    ul += 1
        
        if ur < 2 * k:
            for i in range(1, n + 1):
                if ur < 2 * k and indices[i][0] >= n:
                    r[ur] = a[indices[i][0]]
                    ur += 1
                if ur < 2 * k and indices[i][1] >= n:
                    r[ur] = a[indices[i][1]]
                    ur += 1
        
        # Print the results
        print(' '.join(map(str, l[:2 * k])))
        print(' '.join(map(str, r[:2 * k])))
```

This corrected program ensures that the arrays `l` and `r` are filled correctly and have exactly `2k` elements, and it also ensures that the elements in `r` are taken from the second half of the array `a`.
