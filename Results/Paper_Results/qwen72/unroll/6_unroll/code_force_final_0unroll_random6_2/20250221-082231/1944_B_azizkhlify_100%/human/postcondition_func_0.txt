The function `func` processes a list `a` of integers of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. It prints pairs of integers from the first half of `a` until `k` pairs are printed or all pairs are exhausted. If more pairs are needed, it prints single integers from the first half of `a` until the required number of elements is printed. Finally, it prints pairs of integers from the second half of `a` to balance the number of printed elements from both halves. The list `a` remains unchanged, and no value is returned.
