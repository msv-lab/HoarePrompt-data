You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: The list `a` remains unchanged. The variables `l` and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the corresponding integer in `a` has been fully processed or not. The variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are integers representing the number of elements processed in the respective parts of the loop. The list `res` contains the integers that were printed in the second part of the loop, if any.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a list `a` of integers of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. It prints pairs of integers from the first half of `a` until `k` pairs are printed or all pairs are exhausted. If more pairs are needed, it prints single integers from the first half of `a` until the required number of elements is printed. Finally, it prints pairs of integers from the second half of `a` to balance the number of printed elements from both halves. The list `a` remains unchanged, and no value is returned.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - It initializes two arrays `l` and `r` of length `n` to keep track of the frequency of elements in the first and second halves of the input array `a`.

2. **Frequency Counting:**
   - The program counts the frequency of each element in the first half of the array `a` and stores it in `l`.
   - It then counts the frequency of each element in the second half of the array `a` and stores it in `r`.

3. **Constructing the First Subset `l`:**
   - The program iterates through the first half of the array `a` and checks if the frequency of the current element in `l` is 2.
   - If the frequency is 2, it prints the element twice, sets the frequency to 0, and increments `ul` by 2.
   - This process continues until `ul` reaches `2k`.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements for `l`:**
   - If `ul` is still less than `2k` after the first loop, the program continues to iterate through the first half of the array `a` and prints elements with a frequency of 1 in `l`.
   - It also appends these elements to the list `res` and increments `re` by 1.
   - This process continues until `re` reaches the remaining count `k`.

5. **Constructing the Second Subset `r`:**
   - The program prints the elements stored in `res` to form the second subset `r`.
   - If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, it iterates through the second half of the array `a` and checks if the frequency of the current element in `r` is 2.
   - If the frequency is 2, it prints the element twice, sets the frequency to 0, and increments `ur` by 2.
   - This process continues until `ul` equals `ur`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of the first subset `l` and the second subset `r`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Frequency Handling:**
  - The program incorrectly updates the frequency arrays `l` and `r` by using `a[i] - 1` as the index. This is problematic because it modifies the frequency array based on the value of `a[i]` rather than the position in the array.
  - The frequency arrays `l` and `r` should be updated based on the position in the array, not the value of the elements.

- **Incorrect Subsets Construction:**
  - The program does not correctly ensure that the subsets `l` and `r` are of length `2k` and that their bitwise XOR is equal.
  - The logic for constructing `l` and `r` is flawed, and it does not guarantee that the subsets will meet the required conditions.

- **Incorrect Use of `ul` and `ur`:**
  - The variables `ul` and `ur` are used to track the number of elements added to the subsets, but the logic for updating them is incorrect.
  - The program does not correctly handle the case where `ul` and `ur` need to be equal.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It has issues with frequency counting, subset construction, and ensuring the subsets meet the required conditions.
