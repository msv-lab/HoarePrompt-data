You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any explicit input parameters. However, it is expected to read from standard input a series of test cases, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases, and each of the following t lines contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` will be unchanged, and for each test case, the variables `ac` and `bc` will contain the counts of 'A' and 'B' characters, respectively, in the string `s` that was input for that test case. Each iteration of the loop will reset `ac` and `bc` to 0 for the next test case. The final state of `ac` and `bc` will be the counts for the last test case. The variable `s` will contain the last string input. 
    #
    #In natural language: The loop will have processed `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have counted the number of 'A' and 'B' characters in the input string `s`. After all iterations, `t` will still be the same, `ac` and `bc` will hold the counts of 'A' and 'B' for the last test case, and `s` will be the last string that was input.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: *The loop will have processed `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have counted the number of 'A' and 'B' characters in the input string `s`. After all iterations, `t` will still be the same, `ac` and `bc` will hold the counts of 'A' and 'B' for the last test case, and `s` will be the last string that was input. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, the condition `ac > bc` holds. Otherwise, the count of 'A' characters (`ac`) is less than or equal to the count of 'B' characters (`bc`).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the output for each test case correctly. The `if ac > bc:` and `else:` blocks are outside the loop that processes each test case, which means the program will only print the result for the last test case. For the given example, the program will only print one result instead of printing a result for each of the 8 test cases. This violates the problem description, which requires an output for each test case.
