The only variables in the loop head are `q` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. Since `t` is read from standard input and must be an integer between 1 and 32, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `q` should be initialized to 0, and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 0**
