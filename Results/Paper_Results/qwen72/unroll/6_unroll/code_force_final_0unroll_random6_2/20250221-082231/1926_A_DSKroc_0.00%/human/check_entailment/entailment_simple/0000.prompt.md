Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any explicit input parameters. However, it is expected to read from standard input a series of test cases, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases, and each of the following t lines contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` will be unchanged, and for each test case, the variables `ac` and `bc` will contain the counts of 'A' and 'B' characters, respectively, in the string `s` that was input for that test case. Each iteration of the loop will reset `ac` and `bc` to 0 for the next test case. The final state of `ac` and `bc` will be the counts for the last test case. The variable `s` will contain the last string input. 
    #
    #In natural language: The loop will have processed `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have counted the number of 'A' and 'B' characters in the input string `s`. After all iterations, `t` will still be the same, `ac` and `bc` will hold the counts of 'A' and 'B' for the last test case, and `s` will be the last string that was input.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: *The loop will have processed `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have counted the number of 'A' and 'B' characters in the input string `s`. After all iterations, `t` will still be the same, `ac` and `bc` will hold the counts of 'A' and 'B' for the last test case, and `s` will be the last string that was input. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, the condition `ac > bc` holds. Otherwise, the count of 'A' characters (`ac`) is less than or equal to the count of 'B' characters (`bc`).
