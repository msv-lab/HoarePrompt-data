The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer value returned by the function `R()`. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be non-zero.

State: **`t` is an integer value returned by the function `R()` and `t` must be non-zero, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, and each query is a pair of integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
