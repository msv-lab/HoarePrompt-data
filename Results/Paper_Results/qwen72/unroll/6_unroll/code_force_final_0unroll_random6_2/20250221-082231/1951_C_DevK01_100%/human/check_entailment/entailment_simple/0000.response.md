### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line and the list of ticket prices `M` from the second line.

2. **Constraints**:
   - The function correctly handles the constraints by ensuring `m` is the minimum of `m` and `k` to avoid buying more tickets than needed in a single day.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The list `M` is sorted in ascending order to minimize the cost of purchasing tickets. This is a good approach because buying tickets on the cheapest days first will generally minimize the total cost.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets**:
   - The number of days `q` needed to buy all `k` tickets is calculated using `math.ceil(k / m)`. This ensures that if `k` is not a multiple of `m`, the function accounts for the additional day required to buy the remaining tickets.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days**:
   - The function selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to buy tickets. This is correct because these days will have the lowest prices.

6. **Calculating the Cost**:
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought on the selected days equals `k` (i.e., `n * m == k`), the cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. This formula accounts for the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `q` days and the additional cost due to the price increase.
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought on the selected days is less than `k`, the function calculates the remaining tickets `mu` and the cost of buying these tickets on the last day. The formula `cost = mu * w` is used to calculate the cost of the remaining tickets, and then the cost of the other days is added.

7. **Output**:
   - The function prints the calculated cost for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - The function does not handle the case where `k` is less than `m` explicitly. However, the logic should still work because `q` will be 1, and the function will correctly calculate the cost for a single day.
- **Price Increase Calculation**:
  - The price increase calculation `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is correct for the first `n` days, but it does not account for the price increase on subsequent days if tickets are bought on the last day. This might lead to incorrect results in some edge cases.

### Correctness:
- The function appears to correctly handle the main logic of buying tickets on the cheapest days and accounting for the price increase. However, the price increase calculation might be incorrect in some edge cases where tickets are bought on the last day.

### Conclusion:
- Given the constraints and the problem description, the function is mostly correct but might have issues with the price increase calculation on the last day.

Correctness: **False**
