Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases defined by an integer `t`. For each test case, it reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the second line contains a list of `n` integers `M`. The function calculates a cost based on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the elements of `M`. The cost is determined by sorting the list `M`, selecting a subset of its elements, and performing arithmetic operations. The calculated cost is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` (if present) remain unchanged. The list `M` is sorted and potentially modified by the `pop` operation, but its state is reset in each iteration. **
