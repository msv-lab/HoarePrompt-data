The code snippet `a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))` creates a list `a` that contains integers from 1 up to and including the value provided by the user input, which is converted to an integer and incremented by 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive).**
