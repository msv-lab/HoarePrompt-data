Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the integer `n` for the current test case.
   - It creates a list `a` containing the integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list `a`. This is done using the slice notation `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`, which means:
     - `a[::2]` selects elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).
     - `a[::2][::-1]` reverses the selected elements.
   - Finally, it prints the modified list `a`.

3. **Permutation Validity:**
   - The program ensures that the permutation `a` does not have two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program effectively breaks any potential divisibility patterns that might exist in the original list. This is because the elements at even indices are now in a different order, and the elements at odd indices remain in their original order.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For `n = 4`, the original list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
     - After reversing the elements at even indices, the list becomes `[3, 2, 1, 4]`.
     - This permutation is valid because:
       - `3` does not divide `1` and `2` does not divide `4`.
       - `1` does not divide `3` and `4` does not divide `2`.
   - For `n = 3`, the original list is `[1, 2, 3]`.
     - After reversing the elements at even indices, the list remains `[1, 2, 3]` (since there is only one even index, 0, and reversing a single element does not change the list).
     - This permutation is valid because:
       - `1` does not divide `3` and `2` does not divide `3`.

The program meets the requirements of the problem and produces valid permutations for the given constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
