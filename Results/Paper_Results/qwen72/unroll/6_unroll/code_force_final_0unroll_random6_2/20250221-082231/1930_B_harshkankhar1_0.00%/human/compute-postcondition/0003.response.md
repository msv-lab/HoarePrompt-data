The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, there is a constraint that `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. Since the function does not have any parameters, the constraint on `n` is not directly applicable to the function's input. The output of the function is not provided, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
