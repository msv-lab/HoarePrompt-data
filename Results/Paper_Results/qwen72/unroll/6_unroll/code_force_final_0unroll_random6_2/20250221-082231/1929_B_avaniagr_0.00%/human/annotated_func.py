#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_cells_to_color(n, k):` where `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: The loop reads lines from the standard input, processes each line to extract `n` and `k`, and prints the result of the given formula for each pair of `n` and `k`. The variables `n` and `k` are updated with each iteration, but their final values depend on the last line of input. The function `min_cells_to_color` remains incomplete and does not match the problem description.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple lines from the standard input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. It processes each line, calculates a value based on the given formula, and prints the result. The final state of the program is that the input has been fully processed, and the calculated results have been printed for each pair of `n` and `k`. The function does not return any value.
