You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple lines from the standard input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. It processes each line, calculates a value based on the given formula, and prints the result. The final state of the program is that the input has been fully processed, and the calculated results have been printed for each pair of `n` and `k`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical flaw in its approach to calculating the minimum number of cells that need to be colored. Specifically, the formula used in the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, especially when `k` is close to `4n - 2`.

For example, consider the case where `n = 3` and `k = 10`. According to the problem description, there are 10 diagonals in a 3x3 grid, and the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to ensure that all 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell is 6. However, the program outputs 5 for this case, which is incorrect.

Let's break down the formula used in the program:
- `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3)`: This part of the formula calculates the minimum number of cells needed when `k` is less than `4n - 3`.
- `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)`: This part of the formula calculates the minimum number of cells needed when `k` is greater than or equal to `4n - 3`.
- `(k == 4 * n - 2)`: This part of the formula adds an additional cell when `k` is exactly `4n - 2`.

The issue arises when `k` is close to `4n - 2` but not exactly `4n - 2`. For `n = 3` and `k = 10`, the program should output 6, but it outputs 5 because the formula does not correctly account for the number of cells needed to cover all 10 diagonals.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
