Output State: **The loop reads lines from the standard input, processes each line to extract `n` and `k`, and prints the result of the given formula for each pair of `n` and `k`. The variables `n` and `k` are updated with each iteration, but their final values depend on the last line of input. The function `min_cells_to_color` remains incomplete and does not match the problem description.**
