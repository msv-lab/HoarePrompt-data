Output State: **For each test case, the value of `s` is calculated based on the given `k`, `x`, and `a`. The loop iterates `x` times, updating `s` in each iteration. After all iterations, the loop prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged for each test case, but `s` is reset to 1 for each new test case.**
