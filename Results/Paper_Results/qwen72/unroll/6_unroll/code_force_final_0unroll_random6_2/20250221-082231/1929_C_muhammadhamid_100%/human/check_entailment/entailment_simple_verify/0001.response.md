### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha starts with `a` coins.
   - If he wins a bet of `y` coins, he gains `y * (k - 1)` coins.
   - If he loses a bet, he loses `y` coins.
   - He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
   - We need to determine if Sasha can guarantee having at least `n` coins for any integer `n`.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To guarantee that Sasha can achieve any number of coins, he must be able to recover from any sequence of losses.
   - The maximum number of consecutive losses is `x`, so after `x` losses, he must have enough coins to place another bet and potentially win.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The program calculates the minimum number of coins `s` required to ensure that Sasha can always place another bet after `x` losses.
   - The formula used in the program is `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` for each of the `x` losses.
   - This formula is derived from the idea that after each loss, Sasha needs to have enough coins to place a bet that can recover the loss and still have a positive number of coins left.

4. **Mathematical Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `s` to `1`.
   - It then iterates `x` times, each time adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to `s`.
   - This calculation is intended to determine the minimum number of coins `s` needed to ensure that Sasha can always place another bet after `x` losses.
   - Finally, it checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`.

5. **Verification Using Annotations:**
   - **Initial State:**
     - `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`.
     - For each test case, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers such that `2 <= k <= 30`, `1 <= x <= 100`, and `1 <= a <= 10^9`.
   - **Inside the Loop:**
     - `k, x, a = map(int, input().split())` reads the input values for each test case.
     - `s = 1` initializes the minimum number of coins required to `1`.
     - The inner loop iterates `x` times, updating `s` in each iteration.
     - `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is the key formula used to update `s`.
     - After the loop, the program checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` and prints `Yes` or `No` accordingly.
   - **Example Test Cases:**
     - **Test Case 1: `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 7`**
       - `s` starts at `1`.
       - After 1 loss: `s += 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.
       - Sasha needs at least `3` coins to guarantee he can always place another bet after 1 loss.
       - Since `a = 7` is greater than `3`, the answer is `YES`.
     - **Test Case 2: `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 1`**
       - `s` starts at `1`.
       - After 1 loss: `s += 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.
       - Sasha needs at least `3` coins to guarantee he can always place another bet after 1 loss.
       - Since `a = 1` is less than `3`, the answer is `NO`.
     - **Test Case 3: `k = 2`, `x = 3`, `a = 15`**
       - `s` starts at `1`.
       - After 1 loss: `s += 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.
       - After 2 losses: `s += 3 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7`.
       - After 3 losses: `s += 7 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 7 + 7 + 1 = 15`.
       - Sasha needs at least `15` coins to guarantee he can always place another bet after 3 losses.
       - Since `a = 15` is equal to `15`, the answer is `YES`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` is just enough to cover the losses and still place another bet.
   - It also handles the case where `a` is much larger than `s`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins `s` required to ensure that Sasha can always place another bet after `x` losses. It then checks if the initial number of coins `a` is sufficient to meet this requirement. The logic and the formula used are appropriate for the problem.
