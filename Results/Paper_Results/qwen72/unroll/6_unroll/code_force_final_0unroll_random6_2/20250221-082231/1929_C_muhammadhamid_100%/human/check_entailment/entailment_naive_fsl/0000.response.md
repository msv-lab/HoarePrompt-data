Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the required number of coins `s` to ensure Sasha can always win any number of coins is flawed. The program increments `s` by `s // (k - 1) + 1` for each consecutive loss, but this does not accurately reflect the strategy needed to guarantee winning any number of coins.

For example, consider the input `2 1 7`. According to the problem description, Sasha can place a bet of 1 coin initially, and if he loses, he can place a bet of 2 coins. This strategy ensures that he can always recover and eventually win any number of coins. However, the program calculates `s` as follows:
- Initial `s = 1`
- After one loss: `s += 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
- The program then checks if `a >= s`, which is `7 >= 3`, and prints "Yes".

This is incorrect because the strategy described in the problem involves placing bets that are multiples of the previous bet, not just incrementing by a fixed amount. The correct approach should involve calculating the minimum number of coins required to ensure that Sasha can always recover from `x` consecutive losses and still have enough coins to continue betting.

A correct approach would be to calculate the minimum number of coins required to ensure that Sasha can always recover from `x` consecutive losses and still have enough coins to continue betting. The correct logic should involve a geometric progression to account for the increasing bet sizes.

For example, the correct calculation for `2 1 7` should be:
- Initial bet: 1 coin
- After one loss: Bet 2 coins (1 * 2)
- Total coins required: 1 + 2 = 3

For `2 3 15`:
- Initial bet: 1 coin
- After one loss: Bet 2 coins (1 * 2)
- After two losses: Bet 4 coins (2 * 2)
- After three losses: Bet 8 coins (4 * 2)
- Total coins required: 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15

The program does not correctly implement this logic, leading to incorrect results for some cases.
