Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `k`, `x`, and `a` where `2 <= k <= 30`, `1 <= x <= 100`, and `1 <= a <= 10^9`. For each test case, it calculates a value `s` by iterating `x` times and updating `s` in each iteration. After the iterations, it prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged for each test case, but `s` is reset to 1 for each new test case. **
