You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` is a beautiful array as defined in the problem, and `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies `1 <= t <= 10^4` and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: The list `a` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same input integer, `arr` remains the same list of integers, and `flag` is `False` if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different, otherwise `flag` remains `True`.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same input integer, `arr` remains the same list of integers, `flag` is `False` if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different, otherwise `flag` remains `True`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` (or `Decimal('Infinity')` if no such sequence exists), `val` is set to the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val`.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr`, or `Decimal('Infinity')` if no such sequence exists)
    #State: *`a` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same input integer, `arr` remains the same list of integers, `val` is set to the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val`. If `flag` is `True`, all consecutive elements in `arr` are the same, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` (or `Decimal('Infinity')` if no such sequence exists). If `flag` is `False`, at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr` are different, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` (or `Decimal('Infinity')` if no such sequence exists).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` for each of the `t` test cases, where `1 <= t <= 10^4` and `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`. It returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
