You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` is a beautiful array as defined in the problem, and `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies `1 <= t <= 10^4` and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: The list `a` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same input integer, `arr` remains the same list of integers, and `flag` is `False` if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different, otherwise `flag` remains `True`.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same input integer, `arr` remains the same list of integers, `flag` is `False` if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different, otherwise `flag` remains `True`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` (or `Decimal('Infinity')` if no such sequence exists), `val` is set to the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val`.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr`, or `Decimal('Infinity')` if no such sequence exists)
    #State: *`a` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same input integer, `arr` remains the same list of integers, `val` is set to the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val`. If `flag` is `True`, all consecutive elements in `arr` are the same, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` (or `Decimal('Infinity')` if no such sequence exists). If `flag` is `False`, at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr` are different, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` (or `Decimal('Infinity')` if no such sequence exists).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the input for each test case. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the first element in `arr` and prints this minimum length. The function handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is implicitly managed by the calling context. The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the integer `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `arr`.

2. **Check for Identical Elements**:
   - The program first checks if all elements in the array are identical by iterating through the array and setting a flag `flag` to `False` if any two consecutive elements are different.
   - If all elements are identical (`flag` remains `True`), it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing any elements.

3. **Counting Elements**:
   - If the array is not entirely identical, the program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and starts counting the occurrences of the first element `val` in the array.
   - It iterates through the array, counting the number of consecutive occurrences of `val` and updating `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive `val` elements found.
   - After the loop, it ensures that the last count is also considered by updating `ans` one final time.

4. **Output**:
   - If the array is not entirely identical, it prints the minimum count of consecutive elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

### Analysis:

- **Identical Elements Check**:
  - This check is correct. If all elements are the same, the array will always be beautiful, and it is impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements.

- **Counting Elements**:
  - The logic for counting consecutive elements and finding the minimum count is flawed. The program is trying to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element, but this does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.
  - The correct approach should be to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the condition that allows the array to be beautiful. Specifically, we need to ensure that there is no index `i` such that `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced with `a[i-1]`.

### Correct Approach:

- **Identify the Minimum Removal**:
  - To make the array not beautiful, we need to ensure that there is no index `i` where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced with `a[i-1]`.
  - One way to do this is to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break all such sequences. This can be done by counting the number of elements that are part of such sequences and removing them.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it only checks for the minimum number of consecutive identical elements, which is not the correct criterion for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
