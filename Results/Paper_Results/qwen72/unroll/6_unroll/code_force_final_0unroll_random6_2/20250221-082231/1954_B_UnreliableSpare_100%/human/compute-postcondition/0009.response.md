Output State: **`a` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same input integer, `arr` remains the same list of integers, `flag` is `False` if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different, otherwise `flag` remains `True`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` (or `Decimal('Infinity')` if no such sequence exists), `val` is set to the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.
- The values of `a`, `n`, `arr`, `flag`, `val`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
- If `ans` was initially `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt` is a finite value, `ans` will now be set to `cnt`.
- If `ans` was already a finite value, it will be updated to the smaller of its current value and `cnt`.
