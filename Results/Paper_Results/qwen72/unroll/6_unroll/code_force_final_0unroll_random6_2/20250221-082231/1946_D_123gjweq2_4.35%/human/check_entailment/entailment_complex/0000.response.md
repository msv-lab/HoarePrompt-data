Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number `k` of segments such that the bitwise OR of the bitwise XOR of each segment is less than or equal to `x`.
   - Each segment must start where the previous segment ends, and the first segment must start at index 1, and the last segment must end at index `n`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(arr, x)`**:
     - This function is supposed to find the maximum number of segments, but it calls `find_max(arr, 31)` instead of using `x`. This is incorrect because `find_max` is not designed to handle the `x` parameter directly.
     - The function should be using `x` to determine the maximum number of segments, but it is not.

   - **`find_max(cur_arr, bit)`**:
     - This function is designed to recursively find the maximum number of segments by checking the `bit`-th bit of the cumulative XOR.
     - If `bit` is -1, it returns the length of `cur_arr`, which is the base case for the recursion.
     - It processes `cur_arr` to create `new_arr` containing cumulative XOR values of elements in `cur_arr` up to the point where the `bit`-th bit of the cumulative XOR is 0.
     - If the `bit`-th bit of the final cumulative XOR is 1, it returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.
     - If the `bit`-th bit of the final cumulative XOR is 0, it returns the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.
     - If `x`'s `bit`-th bit is 1, it returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.
     - If `x`'s `bit`-th bit is 0, it returns `thing1`, which is either -1 or the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.

3. **Issues**:
   - **Incorrect Function Call**: `func_1` calls `find_max(arr, 31)` instead of using `x` in the function call. This means the function `find_max` is not being used correctly to solve the problem.
   - **Bitwise Logic**: The logic in `find_max` is designed to check the `bit`-th bit of the cumulative XOR, but it does not directly use `x` to ensure the bitwise OR condition is met. The function should be checking the bitwise OR of the cumulative XORs against `x`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program as written does not correctly solve the problem because it does not use the `x` parameter in the main function `func_1` and the recursive function `find_max` does not ensure the bitwise OR condition is met.

Correctness: **False**
