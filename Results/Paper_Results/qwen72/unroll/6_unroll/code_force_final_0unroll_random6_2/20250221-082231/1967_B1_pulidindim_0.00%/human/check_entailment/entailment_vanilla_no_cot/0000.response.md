Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic and the approach used in the program are flawed. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `ans`**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is not the correct starting point for counting valid pairs. The correct starting point should be 0, as you need to count all valid pairs from scratch.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The loop iterates over `count` from 2 to `m`, but the calculation inside the loop is incorrect. The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not correctly checked or counted.
   - The variable `countmins` is set to `count - 1`, which is not used correctly in the context of the problem.
   - The calculation `g = n / count` and `g -= countmins` does not make sense in the context of the problem. The division and subtraction operations are not aligned with the problem's requirements.
   - The line `ans += g / count + 1` is also incorrect and does not contribute to the correct count of valid pairs.

3. **Incorrect Use of `gcd`**:
   - The program does not use the `gcd` function at all, which is essential for solving the problem. The `gcd` function is needed to check the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
- Iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges.
- For each pair `(a, b)`, calculate `gcd(a, b)` and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- Count the number of valid pairs and print the result for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition using the `gcd` function. It correctly counts the number of valid pairs and prints the result for each test case.
