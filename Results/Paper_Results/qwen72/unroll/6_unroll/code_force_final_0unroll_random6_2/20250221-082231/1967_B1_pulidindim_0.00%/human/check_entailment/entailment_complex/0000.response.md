Reasoning:

The given problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the provided program and analyze its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to \(n\).

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop iterates from `count = 2` to `count <= m`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
     - `g` is calculated as \(n / \text{count}\).
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
     - `ans` is updated by adding \((g / \text{count}) + 1\).
     - `count` is incremented by 1.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the integer value of `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

1. **Initial Value of `ans`**:
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to \(n\). This is correct because for \(b = 1\), \(a + b\) is always a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) (since \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\)), and there are \(n\) such pairs \((a, 1)\).

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop starts from `count = 2` and iterates up to `count <= m`.
   - For each `count`, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`.
   - `g` is calculated as \(n / \text{count}\). This is the maximum value of \(a\) such that \(a\) is a multiple of `count`.
   - The condition `if g < countmins` is used to break the loop if `g` is less than `count - 1`. This is because if `g` is less than `count - 1`, there are no valid pairs \((a, b)\) for the current `count` and any larger `count`.
   - `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`, which is correct because we are only interested in values of \(a\) that are greater than or equal to `count - 1`.
   - `ans` is updated by adding \((g / \text{count}) + 1\). This is the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for the current `count`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The final value of `ans` is printed as an integer for each test case.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Initialization of `ans`**:
  - The initial value of `ans` should be 0, not \(n\). The initial value \(n\) only accounts for the pairs where \(b = 1\), but the loop should start from `count = 2` and add the valid pairs for each \(b\).

- **Incorrect Calculation of `ans`**:
  - The calculation `ans += g / count + 1` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `ans += g // count + 1` to ensure integer division.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        ans = 0
        
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            countmins = b - 1
            g = n // b
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g // b + 1
        
        print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program has logical errors in the initialization and calculation of `ans`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
