Output State: **The function `func` has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, the final value of `ans` is printed as an integer. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` retain their initial values, and the loop counter `i` has completed all iterations from 0 to `t-1`. The variable `count` for each test case ends with a value that is either `m + 1` or the value where `g < count - 1` condition breaks the loop.**
