The function `func` processes up to 10,000 test cases, where each test case involves two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). For each test case, it calculates a value `ans` based on the inputs `n` and `m` and prints the final integer value of `ans`. The function ensures that the sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^6. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the variables `t`, `n`, and `m` retain their initial values, while the loop counter `i` has completed all iterations from 0 to `t-1`.
