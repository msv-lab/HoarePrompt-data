Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to find the index of the smallest element in the prefix sum array `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`. However, it does not correctly handle the case where `x` is not found in the array. The function should return the index of the next greater element, but it returns `inx + 1` which is incorrect if `a[inx]` is not equal to `x`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten. However, the logic used to determine the minimum number of seconds is flawed.
   - The prefix sum array `left` is used to calculate the total size of slimes to the left of the current slime, but the way it is used to determine the minimum number of seconds is not correct.
   - The variable `inx2` is supposed to track the last index where the size of the slime changed, but it is not used correctly to determine the minimum number of seconds.

3. **Logic for Eaten Slimes**:
   - The program only checks if the current slime can be eaten by the previous slime (`a[i] < a[i - 1]`), but it does not consider the possibility of the current slime being eaten by a subsequent slime.
   - The program does not handle the case where a slime can be eaten by a larger slime that is not immediately adjacent but can reach it after some other slimes are eaten.

4. **Output**:
   - The output of the program does not match the expected output for the given test cases. For example, for the input `3 2 4 2`, the expected output is `2 1 2 1`, but the program's logic does not produce this result.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a stack to keep track of the slimes that can potentially eat others and calculating the minimum time for each slime to be eaten. The provided program does not implement this correctly.
