Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Here is a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
2 2 3 1 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 1 -1 1 2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2 1 -1 1 -1
```

The program incorrectly outputs `-1` for the 5th slime, which should be `2`. The 5th slime can be eaten by the 3rd slime after the 3rd slime eats the 2nd and 1st slimes, and then the 5th slime is eaten by the 3rd slime.

This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the scenario where a slime can be eaten after multiple steps. The logic in `func_2` is not comprehensive enough to account for all possible sequences of slimes eating each other.
