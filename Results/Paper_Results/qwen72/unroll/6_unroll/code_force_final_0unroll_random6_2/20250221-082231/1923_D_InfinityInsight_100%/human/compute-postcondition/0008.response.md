To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's break down the loop and understand its behavior step by step.

### Initial State:
- `left` is a list containing the cumulative sum of elements in `a` starting from 0.
- `last` and `ans` remain unchanged.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
        ans[i] = 1
        continue
    x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
    inx = func_1(left, x)
    inx2 = last[i - 1]
    if inx2 < inx:
        inx = inx2
    if inx < 0:
        continue
    ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `if a[i] < a[i - 1]`:**
   - If the current element `a[i]` is less than the previous element `a[i - 1]`, set `ans[i]` to 1 and skip the rest of the loop body for this iteration.

2. **Calculate `x`:**
   - `x` is calculated as `left[i] - a[i] - 1`.
   - `left[i]` is the cumulative sum of elements in `a` up to index `i`.

3. **Find `inx` using `func_1`:**
   - `inx` is the result of calling `func_1(left, x)`. This function is not defined, but it likely returns an index in the `left` list.

4. **Update `inx` with `inx2`:**
   - `inx2` is the value of `last[i - 1]`.
   - If `inx2` is less than `inx`, update `inx` to `inx2`.

5. **Check `inx` for negative value:**
   - If `inx` is less than 0, skip the rest of the loop body for this iteration.

6. **Update `ans[i]`:**
   - If the above conditions are not met, set `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx`.

### Output State:
- **`left`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`last`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ans`**: The values in `ans` are updated based on the conditions in the loop. Specifically:
  - If `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1.
  - Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the minimum of `func_1(left, x)` and `last[i - 1]`.

### Natural Language Description:
- The `left` list remains the same as it was initially.
- The `last` list remains unchanged.
- The `ans` list is updated such that:
  - For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`:
    - If the current element `a[i]` is less than the previous element `a[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1.
    - Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the minimum of the index returned by `func_1(left, x)` and the value of `last[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`left` remains unchanged, `last` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated based on the conditions in the loop.**
