The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `range(1, n)`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` will start from 1 as specified in the loop head.

State: **`left` is a list containing the cumulative sum of elements in `a` starting from 0, `last` and `ans` remain unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
