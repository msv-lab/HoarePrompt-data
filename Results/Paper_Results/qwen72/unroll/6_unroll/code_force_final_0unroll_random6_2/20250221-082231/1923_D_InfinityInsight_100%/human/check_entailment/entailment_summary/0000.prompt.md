Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `x` (1 <= x <= 10^9). It returns -1 if `x` is less than 0. If `x` is found in the list `a`, it returns the index of `x` plus 1. If `x` is not found in the list `a`, it returns the value `inx` which is the index returned by the function `bl(a, x)`, and `a[inx]` is not equal to `x`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(a, n):
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
    return ans
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `a` and a non-negative integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element `ans[i]` (for `1 <= i < n`) is updated based on the following conditions: If `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to the difference between `i + 1` and the index of the last occurrence of a different element before `i` in `a`, or -1 if no such element exists. The function maintains the cumulative sum of elements in `a` in a list `left` and the indices of the last occurrence of a different element in a list `last`, but these are not returned.
