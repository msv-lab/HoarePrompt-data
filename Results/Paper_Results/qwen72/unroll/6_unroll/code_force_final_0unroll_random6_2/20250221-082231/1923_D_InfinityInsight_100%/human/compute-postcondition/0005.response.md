The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `a` during the first iteration.

State: **`left` is a list containing the integer 0, `last` is a list of length `n` where the first element is -1 and the subsequent elements are the indices of the last occurrence of a different element before the current index in the list `a`, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to -1, `a` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element in `a`**
