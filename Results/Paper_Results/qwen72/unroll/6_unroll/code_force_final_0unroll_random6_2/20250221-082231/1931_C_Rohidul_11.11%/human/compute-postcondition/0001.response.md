Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints the maximum length of the subarray that does not contain any consecutive equal elements, or 0 if the entire array consists of equal elements. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not modified in the final output state, but the loop has processed all test cases.**
