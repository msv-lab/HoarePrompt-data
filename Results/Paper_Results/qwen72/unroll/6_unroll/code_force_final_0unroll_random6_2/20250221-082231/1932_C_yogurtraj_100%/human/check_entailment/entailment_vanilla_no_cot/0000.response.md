Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly process the commands as specified in the problem description. The main issue is in how the program handles the product of the array elements and the removal of elements based on the commands. Here are the specific problems:

1. **Initial Product Calculation**: The program does not calculate the initial product of all elements in the array `a` before processing any commands. This is crucial because the first output should be the remainder of the product of all elements modulo `m`.

2. **Incorrect Indexing and Product Update**: The program uses `q1` and `q2` to track the indices of the elements to be removed, but these indices are not correctly updated or used to reflect the actual state of the array after each command is processed. The logic for updating `q1` and `q2` is flawed and does not match the problem requirements.

3. **Handling of 'L' and 'R' Commands**: The program incorrectly handles the 'L' and 'R' commands. It should remove elements from the array and update the product accordingly, but the current implementation does not do this correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        commands = input()
        
        # Calculate the initial product modulo m
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        # Initialize the result list
        result = [0] * n
        
        # Process each command
        for i in range(n):
            result[i] = product
            if commands[i] == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(a[i], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove the leftmost element
            else:
                product = (product * pow(a[n-1-i], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove the rightmost element
        
        print(*result)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initial Product Calculation**: The program calculates the initial product of all elements in the array `a` and takes the modulo `m`.

2. **Result List Initialization**: The result list `result` is initialized to store the remainders for each command.

3. **Processing Commands**: For each command:
   - The current product is stored in the result list.
   - If the command is 'L', the leftmost element is removed by dividing the product by the leftmost element and taking the modulo `m`. This is done using the modular inverse of the element.
   - If the command is 'R', the rightmost element is removed by dividing the product by the rightmost element and taking the modulo `m`. This is also done using the modular inverse of the element.

4. **Modular Inverse**: The modular inverse is calculated using `pow(a[i], m-2, m)` which works under the assumption that `m` is a prime number (or that the elements are coprime with `m`). This ensures that the division is correctly handled under modulo arithmetic.

This corrected program should now correctly process the commands and produce the expected output.
