t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of the values of n for all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
