### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the list `a`, and the string `s`.
   - It initializes `l` to the count of 'L' characters in `s`.
   - It initializes `k` to the last element of `a` modulo `m` if the last command is 'R', or to the `l-1`-th element of `a` modulo `m` if the last command is 'L'.
   - It initializes `q1` and `q2` to track the positions of elements to be multiplied.

2. **Output List Initialization**:
   - The list `y` is initialized to store the results of the modular multiplications for each command.

3. **Final State Calculation**:
   - The last element of `y` is set to `k`, which is the result of the last command.

4. **Backward Calculation**:
   - The function iterates backward from the second-to-last command to the first command.
   - For each command, it updates `k` by multiplying it with the appropriate element from `a` and taking the result modulo `m`.
   - It then updates the positions `q1` and `q2` based on the command ('L' or 'R').

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the list `y` for each test case.

### Issues and Correctness:

- **Initialization of `k`**:
  - The initialization of `k` is incorrect. The initial value of `k` should be the product of all elements in `a` modulo `m`, not just the last or `l-1`-th element.
  - The correct initialization should be:
    ```python
    k = 1
    for num in a:
        k = (k * num) % m
    ```

- **Backward Calculation**:
  - The backward calculation logic is flawed. The positions `q1` and `q2` are not correctly tracking the elements to be removed.
  - The correct approach should be to maintain a running product and update it by dividing the appropriate element when a command is processed.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = input()
        
        # Initialize the product of all elements modulo m
        k = 1
        for num in a:
            k = (k * num) % m
        
        # Initialize the output list
        y = [0] * n
        
        # Process the commands from left to right
        for i in range(n):
            y[i] = k
            if s[i] == 'L':
                k = (k * pow(a[i], -1, m)) % m
            else:
                k = (k * pow(a[n - 1 - i], -1, m)) % m
        
        print(*y)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **Initialization of `k`**:
  - `k` is initialized to the product of all elements in `a` modulo `m`.

- **Processing Commands**:
  - For each command, the current value of `k` is stored in `y`.
  - If the command is 'L', the leftmost element is removed by dividing `k` by `a[i]` and taking the result modulo `m`.
  - If the command is 'R', the rightmost element is removed by dividing `k` by `a[n - 1 - i]` and taking the result modulo `m`.
  - The `pow(a[i], -1, m)` function is used to compute the modular inverse of `a[i]` modulo `m`, which is necessary for division in modular arithmetic.

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed initialization of `k` and the incorrect logic for updating `k` during the backward calculation. The corrected program addresses these issues and should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
