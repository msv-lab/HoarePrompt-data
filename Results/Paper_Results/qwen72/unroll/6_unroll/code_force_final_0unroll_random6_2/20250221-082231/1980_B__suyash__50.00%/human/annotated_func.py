#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n, f, k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        b = list(map(int, a.split()))
        
        o = input().split()
        
        n = b[0]
        
        f = b[1]
        
        k = b[2]
        
        if k == n:
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        fav = o[f - 1]
        
        dic = {i: o.count(i) for i in o}
        
        o.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if o.index(fav) > k - 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        l = sorted(list(set(o)), reverse=True)
        
        for i in range(len(l)):
            if fav != l[i]:
                k -= dic[l[i]]
                if k <= 0:
                    print('NO')
                    break
            else:
                k -= dic[l[i]]
                if k < 0:
                    print('MAYBE')
                    break

    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are input variables. The variables `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `fav`, `dic`, and `l` are re-initialized and updated in each iteration of the loop, but their final values after the loop depends on the last iteration's input. The loop prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each iteration based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple sets of inputs and processes each set to determine if a specific condition is met. For each set, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of integers `a` and another list of integers `o`. It then checks if the favorite element (determined by the index `f-1` in `o`) can be within the top `k` elements of `o` when sorted in descending order. The function prints 'YES' if the favorite element is within the top `k` elements, 'NO' if it is not, and 'MAYBE' if it is within the top `k` but the condition is ambiguous. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed. The input variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are re-read for each test case.
