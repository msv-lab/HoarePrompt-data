Output State: **`t` remains the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `N` remains the input integer, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is 0, `ls` is the sum of the initial elements in `nums`, `nw` is True, `cw` is True.**

The variable `cw` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `N`, `nums`, `ls`, and `nw`) remain unchanged.
