The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `nums`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `nums` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is the number of test cases, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, including 0, and `ls` is 0. For the loop to execute, `nums` must have at least one element, and `i` must be 0.

State: **`t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, including 0, and must have at least 1 element, `ls` is 0, `i` is 0**
