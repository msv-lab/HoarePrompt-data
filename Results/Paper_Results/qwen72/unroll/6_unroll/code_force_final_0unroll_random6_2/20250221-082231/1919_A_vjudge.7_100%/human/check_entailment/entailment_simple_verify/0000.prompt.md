You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

    1000000000 1000000000
    
    53110 2024

Output

    Bob
    Alice

    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. Additionally, the function should be designed to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations. The values of `a` and `b` are not retained after each iteration, and the variable `t` has been incremented from 0 to `test - 1`. The output for each iteration is either 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program contains a logical error in the condition `if a + b & 1 == 0:`. The bitwise AND operator `&` has higher precedence than the addition operator `+`, so the expression `a + b & 1` is evaluated as `a + (b & 1)`. This is incorrect because the intended operation is to check if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, which should be written as `(a + b) & 1 == 0`.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  1 2
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  Alice
  ```
- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  Bob
  ```

In this case, the sum of `a` and `b` is `3`, which is odd. The correct output should be "Alice" because the sum is odd. However, the program incorrectly evaluates `1 + 2 & 1` as `1 + 0` (since `2 & 1` is `0`), which is `1`, and then checks `1 == 0`, which is `False`. Therefore, it incorrectly prints "Alice" instead of "Bob".

The correct condition should be:
```python
if (a + b) & 1 == 0:
```

This ensures that the sum of `a` and `b` is correctly evaluated before checking if it is even.
