### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Rules:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.
   - Each player can either swap wallets with the other or keep their current wallet.
   - After making the decision, the player must remove 1 coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game is a turn-based game where each player can remove one coin per turn.
   - The total number of coins \( a + b \) is crucial. If the total number of coins is even, the game will end in a draw if both players play optimally, but since the game must have a winner, Bob will win because he will be the one to make the last move.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will win because she will be the one to make the last move.

3. **Bitwise Operation:**
   - The condition \( a + b \) & 1 == 0 checks if the sum \( a + b \) is even.
   - If \( a + b \) is even, the result of the bitwise AND operation with 1 will be 0.
   - If \( a + b \) is odd, the result of the bitwise AND operation with 1 will be 1.

4. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It then checks if \( a + b \) is even using the bitwise AND operation.
   - If \( a + b \) is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If \( a + b \) is odd, it prints "Alice".

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the input \( (1, 1) \), \( a + b = 2 \) (even), so the output should be "Bob".
   - For the input \( (1, 4) \), \( a + b = 5 \) (odd), so the output should be "Alice".
   - For the input \( (5, 3) \), \( a + b = 8 \) (even), so the output should be "Bob".
   - For the input \( (4, 5) \), \( a + b = 9 \) (odd), so the output should be "Alice".
   - These match the expected outputs in the problem description.

6. **Challenging the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the key insight that the parity of the total number of coins determines the winner.
   - The bitwise operation used in the program is a correct and efficient way to check the parity.
   - The program logic and the function summary align with the problem description and the expected behavior.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
