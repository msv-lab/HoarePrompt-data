Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem by determining the winner based on the parity (even or odd) of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The logic behind this is that if the sum of the coins is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally, and if the sum is odd, Alice will always win. This is because the game is essentially a turn-based game where each player can either swap wallets or remove a coin, and the player who cannot make a move loses. Since the game is deterministic and both players play optimally, the winner can be determined by the initial state of the game.

However, there is a small issue in the program: the condition `if a + b & 1 == 0:` is incorrect. The `&` operator is a bitwise AND, not a modulo operator. The correct condition should be `if (a + b) % 2 == 0:` to check if the sum of `a` and `b` is even.

Given this, the program as written will not correctly determine the winner in all cases. For example, when `a + b` is 3 (which is odd), the expression `3 & 1` evaluates to 1, which is not equal to 0, so the program will print 'Alice' instead of 'Bob'. This is incorrect based on the problem's logic.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, the condition should be changed to use the modulo operator:

```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

With this correction, the program will correctly determine the winner based on the problem's requirements.
