Precondition: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided seems incomplete as it only includes the parameter `n` but not `k`. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
```

Given this, the precondition should be:

Precondition: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.**
