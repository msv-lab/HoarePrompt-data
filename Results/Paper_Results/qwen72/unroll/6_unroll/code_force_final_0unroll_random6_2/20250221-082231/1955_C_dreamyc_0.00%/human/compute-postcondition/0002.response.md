To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to ensure that both conditions in the loop head are met:
1. `k` must be a positive integer (i.e., `k > 0`).
2. The length of `nums` must be at least 2 (i.e., `len(nums) >= 2`).

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15.
- `nums` is a deque containing the same elements as the original list `nums`, where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9.
- `ans` is 0.

We need to check if these conditions are already met:
- `k` is already a positive integer, so it satisfies the first condition.
- `nums` is a deque containing elements, but we need to ensure that it has at least 2 elements.

Since `n` is a positive integer and `nums` is a deque containing the same elements as the original list `nums`, we can assume that `nums` has at least `n` elements. Given that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `nums` will have at least 1 element. However, for the loop to execute, `nums` must have at least 2 elements.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `nums` has at least 2 elements. The initial state already ensures that `k` is positive, so no adjustment is needed for `k`.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing the same elements as the original list `nums` and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is 0**
