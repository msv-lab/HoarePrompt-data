Reasoning:  
The program provided is designed to solve the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases `q` and then iterates `q` times, each time reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then checks the conditions for a "stair" (`a < b < c`) and a "peak" (`a < b > c`). If either condition is met, it prints the corresponding result; otherwise, it prints "NONE". The program follows the input and output format specified in the problem description and handles the conditions correctly.

However, there is a minor issue with the variable names used in the comments. The problem description uses `t` to represent the number of test cases, but the program uses `q` for the same purpose. Despite this inconsistency, the program itself is correct and will work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
