Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it generates an array `ans` of length `n` where the elements are powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of 1s in the binary representation of `k`. The last element of `ans` is adjusted to ensure the sum of the array equals `k`. The loop then prints the elements of `ans` for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are updated for each test case, but their initial constraints remain the same.**
