### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns removing elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a` itself.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - The variable `t` is used to track the number of unique integers that appear exactly once in `a`.
   - The program iterates through the integers from 0 to `N-1` and checks:
     - If the integer `i` appears exactly once in `a`, it increments `t`.
     - If `t` reaches 2 or the integer `i` is missing from `a` (i.e., `cnt[i] == 0`), it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest integer that appears exactly once in `a` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest integer that appears exactly once in `a` to minimize the MEX.
   - If there are no integers that appear exactly once, the MEX will be the smallest integer that is missing from `a`.

4. **Program Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest integer that is either missing from `a` or appears exactly once.
   - The logic of breaking out of the loop when `t` reaches 2 or when a missing integer is found is correct because:
     - If `t` reaches 2, it means there are two unique integers that appear exactly once, and the MEX will be the next integer.
     - If a missing integer is found, it is the smallest integer not in `a`, which is the MEX.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all integers in `a` are the same (e.g., `a = [1, 1]`), correctly printing 0.
   - It also handles the case where `a` contains all integers from 0 to `N-1` (e.g., `a = [0, 1, 2, 3]`), correctly printing 1.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob and prints the correct MEX for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
