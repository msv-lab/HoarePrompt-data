### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Alice appends elements to `c` and Bob deletes elements from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty, and the score is the MEX of `c`.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice should always choose the smallest element that appears only once in `a` to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob should always choose the smallest element that appears only once in `a` to minimize the MEX of `c`.
   - If no such element exists, the MEX of `c` will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `a`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the range `[0, N-1]` to find the smallest integer `i` such that:
     - `cnt[i] == 1` (i.e., `i` appears exactly once in `a`).
     - If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - The variable `t` is used to count the number of elements that appear exactly once in `a`.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It correctly identifies the smallest integer `i` that either:
     - Does not appear in `a` (`cnt[i] == 0`).
     - Appears exactly once in `a` and has been chosen by Alice or Bob (`t >= 2`).
   - The condition `t >= 2` ensures that if two or more elements appear exactly once, the game will end with the smallest such element being the MEX.
   - The program prints the correct MEX for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.

**Correctness: True**
