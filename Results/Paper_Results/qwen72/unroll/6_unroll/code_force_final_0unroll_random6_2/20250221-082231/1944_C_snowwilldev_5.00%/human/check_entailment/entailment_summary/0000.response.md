Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the MEX of the final array `c` after both Alice and Bob play optimally. The optimal strategy for Alice is to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob's strategy is to minimize it. The key to solving this problem is understanding how the MEX is affected by the choices of Alice and Bob.

The provided program works as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.
3. It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
4. It iterates through the integers from 0 to `N-1` and checks:
   - If the integer `i` appears exactly once in `a`, it increments a counter `t`.
   - If the counter `t` reaches 2 (indicating that two unique integers have been found that appear exactly once) or if the integer `i` is missing from `a`, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

This approach is correct because:
- If an integer `i` is missing from `a`, it will be the MEX of the final array `c` because neither Alice nor Bob can add it to `c`.
- If an integer `i` appears exactly once in `a`, it will be added to `c` by Alice, and Bob will not be able to add it again. Therefore, the MEX of `c` will be the next integer that is missing or appears exactly once.
- The program correctly identifies the first integer `i` that either appears exactly once or is missing, which is the MEX of the final array `c`.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description. It efficiently counts the occurrences and determines the MEX in linear time, which is suitable for the given constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
