### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a`.
   - Alice appends the chosen element to a new array `c`, while Bob simply removes it.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` when the game ends, assuming both players play optimally.
   - MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she will try to include as many unique elements as possible in `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he will try to remove elements that Alice might need to maximize the MEX.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - If an element appears more than once in `a`, Alice can always choose one of them, and Bob can only remove one.
   - If an element appears exactly once, Alice and Bob will both have a chance to pick it, but Alice will always pick it first if it is the smallest such element.
   - The game ends when all elements are removed from `a`.

4. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the possible values from 0 to `N-1` (since the elements are in the range `[0, N-1]`).
   - For each value `i`, it checks:
     - If `cnt[i] == 1`, it increments a counter `t` by 1.
     - If `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i] == 0`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The logic of the program is to find the smallest integer `i` that either:
     - Does not appear in `a` (i.e., `cnt[i] == 0`).
     - Appears exactly once, and Alice and Bob have already picked another unique element (i.e., `t >= 2`).
   - This ensures that the MEX is correctly identified because:
     - If `cnt[i] == 0`, `i` is the smallest integer not in `a` and thus not in `c`.
     - If `t >= 2`, it means that Alice and Bob have already picked two unique elements, and the next smallest integer that is not in `c` is `i`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all elements are unique and the case where some elements are repeated.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the array `a` is empty or contains only one element.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` when both players play optimally. The logic and implementation are sound and handle all the necessary cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
