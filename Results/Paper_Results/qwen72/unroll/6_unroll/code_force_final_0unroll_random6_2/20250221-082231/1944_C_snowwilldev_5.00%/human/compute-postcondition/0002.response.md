The function `func` accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. The constraints are as follows: 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= a_i < n for all elements a_i in `a`, and the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters `a` and `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` with the constraints 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= a_i < n for all elements a_i in `a`. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
