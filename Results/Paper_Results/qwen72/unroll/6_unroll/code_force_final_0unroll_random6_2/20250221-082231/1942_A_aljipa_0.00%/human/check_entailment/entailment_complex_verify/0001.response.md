### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array \( a \) of length \( n \) such that exactly \( k \) of its cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - The array \( a \) should satisfy \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \) for each \( 1 \leq i \leq n \).

2. **Special Cases:**
   - **Case 1: \( k = n \)**
     - If \( k = n \), all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. This is only possible if the array is constant (i.e., all elements are the same).
     - The program constructs an array with all elements equal to 1, which is correct.
   - **Case 2: \( k = 1 \)**
     - If \( k = 1 \), exactly one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. This can be achieved by creating an array where the elements are in strictly increasing order, except for one element that is much larger than the others.
     - The program constructs an array with elements in the range \( [0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1] \). However, the problem specifies that \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \), so the elements should be in the range \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) to meet the problem constraints.
   - **Case 3: \( 1 < k < n \)**
     - If \( 1 < k < n \), it is not possible to construct an array that has exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts. This is because if an array has more than one sorted cyclic shift, it implies that the array must have a repeating pattern or be constant, which would result in either all shifts being sorted or none being sorted.
     - The program correctly outputs \(-1\) for this case.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program handles the special cases correctly for \( k = n \) and \( 1 < k < n \).
   - However, for \( k = 1 \), the program constructs an array with elements starting from 0, which does not meet the problem's constraint that \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \).

4. **Verification:**
   - **Case \( k = n \):**
     - The array \( [1, 1, \ldots, 1] \) is indeed sorted in all cyclic shifts.
   - **Case \( k = 1 \):**
     - The array \( [0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1] \) is not valid because it contains 0, which is outside the allowed range.
   - **Case \( 1 < k < n \):**
     - The program correctly outputs \(-1\) because no such array exists.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect for the given problem description because it does not handle the case \( k = 1 \) correctly. The array should contain elements in the range \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) instead of \( [0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1] \).

Correctness: **False**
