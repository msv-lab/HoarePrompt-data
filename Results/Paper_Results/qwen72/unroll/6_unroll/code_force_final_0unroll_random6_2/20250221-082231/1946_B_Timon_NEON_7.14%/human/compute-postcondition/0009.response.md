To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of `segments_variants`, as it is the only object in the loop head that can be adjusted. The loop will execute if `segments_variants` is not empty. Given the initial state, `segments_variants` is a list of lists, and it must contain at least one list for the loop to execute.

Let's break down the state adjustments:

1. **`segments_variants` must contain at least one list**: This is necessary for the loop to execute at least once.
2. **`segment` is the first list in `segments_variants`**: This is the initial state of `segment` before the loop starts.

The other variables (`new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and `total_max_segment`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`segments_variants` is a list of lists that must contain at least one list, `segment` is the first list in `segments_variants`**
