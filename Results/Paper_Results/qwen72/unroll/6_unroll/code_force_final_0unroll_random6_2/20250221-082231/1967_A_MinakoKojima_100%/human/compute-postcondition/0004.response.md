Output State: **The loop will print each element of `ans_list` on a new line. The final state of `ans_list` remains unchanged as a list of integers, each representing the final answer for the corresponding test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` will have no meaningful values outside the context of the loop, as they are redefined for each test case.**
