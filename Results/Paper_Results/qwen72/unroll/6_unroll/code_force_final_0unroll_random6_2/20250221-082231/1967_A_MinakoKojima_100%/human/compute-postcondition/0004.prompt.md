Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `ans_list` will contain the results of the computations for each test case, and the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` will no longer be in their initial states but will have been updated or redefined within the loop. The final state of `ans_list` will be a list of integers, each representing the final answer for the corresponding test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` will have no meaningful values outside the context of the loop, as they are redefined for each test case.
Code of the loop:
for a in ans_list:
    print(a)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
