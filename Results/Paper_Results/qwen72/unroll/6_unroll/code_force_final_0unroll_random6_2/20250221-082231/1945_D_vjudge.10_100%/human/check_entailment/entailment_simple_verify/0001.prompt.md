You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 <= pergunta <= 10^4), a and b are lists of integers of length n (1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9), and n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000.

    #State: pergunta is the minimum value between the initial pergunta and the sum of the minimum values of a[i] and x for the first m elements of the list a, starting from the end. x is the sum of the minimum values of a[i] and b[i] for all elements from the end of the list to the beginning. The values of a, b, n, and m remain unchanged.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum value between the initial pergunta and the sum of the minimum values of a[i] and x for the first m elements of the list a, starting from the end, and x is the sum of the minimum values of a[i] and b[i] for all elements from the end of the list to the beginning)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `numCasos`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and then the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')`, which is a good choice to represent an initially infinite cost.

3. **Loop through the Queue:**
   - The loop iterates from the end of the queue (position `n-1`) to the front (position `0`).
   - For each position `i`:
     - If `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`. This is because Kirill can move to position `i` and pay `a[i]` coins to the person at position `i`, plus the accumulated cost `x` for moving past other people.
     - It updates `x` by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This is because Kirill will either pay `a[i]` to move to position `i` or `b[i]` to move past position `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `pergunta`, which should be the minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

### Analysis:
- The logic of the program seems to correctly implement the idea of minimizing the cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people.
- The use of `min(a[i], b[i])` ensures that Kirill pays the least amount of coins to move past each person.
- The condition `if i < m` correctly checks if the current position `i` is within the first `m` positions, and updates the minimum cost accordingly.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the case where `m` is equal to `n` (Kirill can stay at the end of the queue without paying any coins).
- The program also handles the case where `m` is 1 (Kirill must move to the very front of the queue).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It iterates through the queue in reverse, updating the minimum cost to move to a position within the first `m` people, and prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the logic implemented.
