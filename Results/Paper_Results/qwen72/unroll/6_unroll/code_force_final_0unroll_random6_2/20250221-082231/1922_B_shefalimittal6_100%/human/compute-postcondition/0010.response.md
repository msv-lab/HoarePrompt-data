The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is expected that the function will process a number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple `(n, a)`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers. The function should return a result based on the processing of these test cases.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, where each element is a tuple `(n, a)`.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= a_i <= n.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

The function `func_1` is expected to return a list of results, one for each test case, based on the processing of the input `test_cases`.

Functionality: **The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
