Output State: **The initial state remains unchanged. The code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the `input` variable to reference the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, which is used to read input from the standard input stream. However, this reassignment does not affect the values of `t`, `test_cases`, or any other variables in the initial state.**

- `t` is still an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is still a list of `t` elements, where each element is a tuple `(n, a)`.
- `n` is still an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5.
- `a` is still a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= a_i <= n.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases still does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
- `input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`.
