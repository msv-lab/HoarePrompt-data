To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from the standard input stream.
   - `idx` is the index after the last element processed in `data`.
   - `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
   - `results` is a list of strings where each string represents the number of ways to choose 2 or 3 identical elements from the sublists of integers derived from `data`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('\n'.join(results))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `results` list contains strings that represent the number of ways to choose 2 or 3 identical elements from sublists of integers.
   - The `print` statement joins all the elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`), and then prints this string.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be a series of strings, each on a new line, representing the number of ways to choose 2 or 3 identical elements from the sublists of integers derived from `data`.

Since the exact content of `data` and the sublists of integers are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values in `results`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **[number of ways to choose 2 or 3 identical elements from sublist 1]
[number of ways to choose 2 or 3 identical elements from sublist 2]
...
[number of ways to choose 2 or 3 identical elements from sublist t]**

Where each line represents the number of ways to choose 2 or 3 identical elements from the corresponding sublist of integers derived from `data`, and `t` is the number of such sublists.
