Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. The logic in the program is flawed because it only counts the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length or 2 sticks of the same length and one different stick, which is not sufficient to ensure that a non-degenerate triangle can be formed.

For a non-degenerate triangle to be formed, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. Given that the lengths of the sticks are powers of 2, the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if all three chosen sticks have the same length, because the sum of two different powers of 2 is always less than or equal to the next higher power of 2.

The program should be modified to correctly implement this logic. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        v = [0] * (n + 1)
        for _ in range(n):
            x = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            v[x] += 1
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if v[i] >= 3:
                ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
        results.append(str(ans))
    print('\n'.join(results))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

This version correctly counts the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length, which is the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle with sticks of lengths that are powers of 2.
