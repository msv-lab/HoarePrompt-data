Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it only counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and then subtracts the occurrences of "mapie". However, this approach does not account for the overlapping cases and does not calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the positions of the substrings "map" and "pie" and determine the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of these substrings. Here is a more accurate approach:

1. Identify all occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the string.
2. Use dynamic programming or a greedy approach to determine the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of these substrings.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_deletions_to_beautiful(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1  # Assume we need to delete the current character
        if i >= 3 and s[i-3:i] == "map":
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 3])  # Check if we can keep "map"
        if i >= 3 and s[i-3:i] == "pie":
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 3])  # Check if we can keep "pie"
    
    return dp[n]

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        print(min_deletions_to_beautiful(s))

func()
```

This corrected program uses dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum deletions required up to each position in the string. It ensures that we only delete the necessary characters to make the string beautiful.
