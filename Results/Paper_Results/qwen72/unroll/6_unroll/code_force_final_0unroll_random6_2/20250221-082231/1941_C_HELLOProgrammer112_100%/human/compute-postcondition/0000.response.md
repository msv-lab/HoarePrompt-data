The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop is controlled by the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. The state of `t` and the list of tuples are not directly related to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted in the context of the loop's execution.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
