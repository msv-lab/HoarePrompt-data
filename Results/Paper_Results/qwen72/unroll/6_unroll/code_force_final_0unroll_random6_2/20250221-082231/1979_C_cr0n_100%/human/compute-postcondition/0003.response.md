The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `vals`. For the loop to execute, `vals` must be a non-empty list. Given the state before the loop starts, `N` is an input integer such that 1 <= N <= 50, and `vals` is a list of integers of length N where each element k_i satisfies 2 <= k_i <= 20, we can conclude that `vals` is already non-empty and has at least one element. Therefore, the loop will execute at least once.

At the start of the loop, `x` will be set to the first element of `vals`, which is also the value of `den`. 

State: **`N` is an input integer such that 1 <= N <= 50, `vals` is a list of integers of length N where each element k_i satisfies 2 <= k_i <= 20, `den` is equal to the first element of `vals`, `x` is the first element of `vals`**
