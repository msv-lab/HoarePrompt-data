The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns their least common multiple (LCM). The LCM is calculated by performing integer division of the product of `a` and `b` by their greatest common divisor (gcd). After the function concludes, the final state of the program includes the returned LCM value.
