Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where all elements in the array are the same. According to the problem description, if all elements in the array are the same, the beauty of the array should be 0. However, the program uses the `func_1` function to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If the array is sorted, it prints 0, which is incorrect for arrays with all elements being the same.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3
69 69 69
```
The expected output is 0, but the program will print 0 only because the array is sorted, not because all elements are the same. This is a specific edge case that the program fails to handle correctly.
