### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`num2`) and the array elements (`a`).

2. **Array Parsing:**
   - The array elements are parsed from a single line of input using a list comprehension with `split()` and `isdigit()`. This ensures that only valid integers are included in the array `a`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the array and increments `order` if the current element is not greater than or equal to the previous element.
   - If `order` remains 0, the array is sorted, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - The program uses the result of `func_1` to determine if the array is already sorted.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints 0, which is incorrect. The maximum beauty of an array is not necessarily 0 if it is already sorted. The maximum beauty is the difference between the largest and smallest elements, regardless of the initial order.
   - If the array is not sorted, the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements, which is correct but can be simplified.

5. **Output:**
   - The calculated beauty is printed for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function `func_1` is not necessary for the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is achieved by sorting the array and calculating the sum of differences. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, but this does not affect the maximum beauty calculation.
  - The function `func_1` is incorrect because it checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, but the problem does not require this check. The maximum beauty can be calculated regardless of the initial order of the array.

- **Beauty Calculation**:
  - Sorting the array and then calculating the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements is the correct approach to maximize the beauty.
  - However, the program should subtract the smallest element from the largest element to get the maximum beauty, as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array is equivalent to the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

### Corrected Program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = b[num2 - 1] - b[0]
    print(beauty)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **Sorting the Array:**
  - The array `a` is sorted to `b`.
- **Beauty Calculation:**
  - The maximum beauty is calculated as the difference between the largest element (`b[num2 - 1]`) and the smallest element (`b[0]`).

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it unnecessarily checks if the array is already sorted and does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty. The corrected program directly sorts the array and calculates the maximum beauty as the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is the correct approach.

Final: **False**
