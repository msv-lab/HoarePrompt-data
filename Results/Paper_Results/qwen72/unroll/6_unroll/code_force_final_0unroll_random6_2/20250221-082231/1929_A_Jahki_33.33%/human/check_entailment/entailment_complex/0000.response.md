### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements `a` from the input.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is strictly increasing.
   - If the array is strictly increasing, it returns `True`.
   - If the array is not strictly increasing, it returns `False`.

3. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the program prints `0` because the beauty of a strictly increasing array is `0` (since \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) is always positive, and the sum of positive differences is maximized when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order).
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - The beauty is calculated as \((b_2 - b_1) + (b_3 - b_2) + \ldots + (b_n - b_{n-1})\), where `b` is the sorted array.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the beauty for each test case.

### Analysis of the Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` checks if the array is strictly increasing by comparing each element with the next one.
- If the array is already strictly increasing, the function returns `True`, and the program prints `0` because no rearrangement can increase the beauty.
- If the array is not strictly increasing, the function returns `False`, and the program proceeds to calculate the maximum beauty.

### Analysis of the Beauty Calculation:
- The maximum beauty is achieved by sorting the array in non-decreasing order.
- The differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array are minimized, and the sum of these differences is maximized.
- The program correctly sorts the array and calculates the sum of the differences.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge case where all elements in the array are the same (e.g., `[69, 69, 69]`). In this case, the beauty is `0`, which is correct.
- The program also handles the case where the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and the beauty is calculated correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum beauty of the array for each test case. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
