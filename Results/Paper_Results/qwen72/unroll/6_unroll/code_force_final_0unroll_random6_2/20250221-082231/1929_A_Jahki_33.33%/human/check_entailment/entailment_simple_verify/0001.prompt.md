You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, num2 is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 <= num2 <= 500.
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `num2` remains unchanged, `order` is the number of times an element in the list `a` is greater than or equal to the next element in the list.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True.
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`num2`) and the array elements (`a`).

2. **Array Parsing:**
   - The array elements are parsed from a single line of input using a list comprehension with `split()` and `isdigit()`. This ensures that only valid integers are included in the array `a`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the array and increments `order` if the current element is not greater than or equal to the previous element.
   - If `order` remains 0, the array is sorted, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - If the array is already sorted (as determined by `func_1`), the program prints 0, which is correct because the beauty of a sorted array is 0.
   - If the array is not sorted, the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

5. **Output:**
   - The calculated beauty is printed for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function `func_1` is not necessary for the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is achieved by sorting the array and calculating the sum of differences. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, but this does not affect the maximum beauty calculation.
  - The function `func_1` is incorrect because it checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, but the problem does not require this check. The maximum beauty can be calculated regardless of the initial order of the array.

- **Beauty Calculation**:
  - Sorting the array and then calculating the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements is the correct approach to maximize the beauty.
  - However, the program should subtract the smallest element from the largest element to get the maximum beauty, as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array is equivalent to the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

### Corrected Program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = b[num2 - 1] - b[0]
    print(beauty)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **Sorting the Array:**
  - The array `a` is sorted to `b`.
- **Beauty Calculation:**
  - The maximum beauty is calculated as the difference between the largest element (`b[num2 - 1]`) and the smallest element (`b[0]`).

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it unnecessarily checks if the array is already sorted and does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty. The corrected program directly sorts the array and calculates the maximum beauty as the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

Correctness: **False**
