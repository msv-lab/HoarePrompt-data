### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case. It parses the input into a list of integers, which is appropriate given the problem constraints.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is correct. It iterates through the array and counts the number of times an element is greater than or equal to the next element. If this count is zero, the array is sorted, and the function returns `True`.

3. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - If the array is already sorted (i.e., `func_1` returns `True`), the program prints `0` because the beauty of a sorted array is zero.
   - If the array is not sorted, the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - The beauty calculation is correct because the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. The sum of the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array is the maximum possible beauty.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the beauty for each test case, either `0` if the array is already sorted or the calculated beauty if the array is not sorted.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly handles the input, checks if the array is sorted, and calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it if necessary. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem description and constraints.
