Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical flaw in the way it attempts to solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks and splits the first element that is out of order and greater than 10, but it does not recursively check if further splits are needed to achieve a sorted array. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where multiple elements might need to be split to achieve a sorted array.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    # Function to split an element into its digits and insert them back into the array
    def split_element(idx):
        element = a[idx]
        a.pop(idx)
        digits = [int(d) for d in str(element)]
        for digit in reversed(digits):
            a.insert(idx, digit)
    
    # Check if the array is already sorted
    if a == sorted(a):
        return True
    
    # Try to split elements and check if the array can be sorted
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] >= 10:
            split_element(i)
            if a == sorted(a):
                return True
    
    return False

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version of the program introduces a helper function `split_element` to handle the splitting of elements into their digits and reinserting them into the array. It then checks if the array can be sorted by attempting to split each element that is at least 10 and verifying if the array becomes sorted after each split. If the array can be sorted at any point, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
