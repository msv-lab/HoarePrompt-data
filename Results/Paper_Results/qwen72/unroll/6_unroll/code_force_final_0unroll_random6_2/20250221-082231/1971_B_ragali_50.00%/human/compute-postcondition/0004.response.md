Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from user input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`, and then for each of the `t` iterations, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. For each string `s`, it checks if the string contains more than one unique character. If it does, it prints 'YES' followed by a modified version of the string `s` (either by rotating it or reversing it, depending on the conditions). If the string contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. After all iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the last input string `s` and its unique characters are stored in the variables `s` and `a`, respectively. **
