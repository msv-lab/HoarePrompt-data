### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row of the river, given the maximum distance `d` between supports.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It starts by setting the first element of the row to 1, which is the cost of installing a support at the river bank.
     - It then increases the cost of installing supports in the first `d` cells by 2. This is because the first support is already installed at the river bank, and the next `d-1` cells must have supports to meet the distance constraint.
     - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports within the range of `d` cells. For each cell from `d` to the end of the row, it updates the cost by adding the minimum cost from the heap, the current depth, and 1 (the cost of installing a support).
     - Finally, it returns the last element of the updated row, which represents the total cost of installing supports for that row.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function reads the input for multiple test cases and calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the river grid `n` and `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d` between supports.
     - It reads the depths of the river cells for each of the `n` rows.
     - It calculates the cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`.
     - It then calculates the sum of the costs for all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum of these sums.

### Analysis:
- **Input Handling**: `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes it for each test case.
- **Cost Calculation**: `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost for a single row by ensuring that the first and last supports are installed and that the distance between any two adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.
- **Sum of Consecutive Rows**: `func_2` correctly calculates the sum of the costs for all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum sum.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows, ensuring that the constraints are met. The use of a min-heap in `func_1` ensures that the cost is minimized efficiently.

### Correctness:
**True**
