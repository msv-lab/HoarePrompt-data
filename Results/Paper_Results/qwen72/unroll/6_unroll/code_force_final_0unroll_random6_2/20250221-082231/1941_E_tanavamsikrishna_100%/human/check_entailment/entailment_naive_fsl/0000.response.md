Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than \(d\). Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to calculate the cost of building a bridge in a single row, but it does not ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than \(d\). The function only considers the minimum cost within a sliding window of size \(d\), but it does not enforce the requirement that the distance between supports is \(|j_1 - j_2| - 1 \leq d\).

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
3 5 1 1
0 1 2 1 0
```
Here, \(n = 3\), \(m = 5\), \(k = 1\), and \(d = 1\). The program should ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than 1. However, the function `func_1` might place supports in such a way that the distance condition is violated. The correct minimum cost for this test case should be 4 (placing supports at positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5)), but the program might output a different result.
