### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the annotations step by step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function 1: `func_1(row, d)`

1. **Initialization:**
   - `row[0] = 1`: This sets the cost of the first support to 1, which is correct since the depth at the river bank is 0 and the cost is \(a_{i,1} + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\).
   - `for i in range(1, d): row[i] = row[i] + 2`: This updates the cost of the first \(d\) cells by adding 2 to each cell. This is incorrect because it does not consider the actual depth of the cells. The correct cost should be \(a_{i,j} + 1\).

2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - `min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]`: This initializes a min-heap with the first \(d\) elements of the row and their indices. This is correct for the initial window.

3. **Sliding Window:**
   - `for i in range(d, len(row))`: This loop iterates over the remaining cells in the row.
   - `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`: This removes elements from the heap that are out of the current window of size \(d\). The condition \(i - (d + 2)\) is incorrect. It should be \(i - d - 1\) to ensure the distance between supports is no more than \(d\).
   - `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1`: This updates the cost of the current cell based on the minimum cost in the heap. This is correct but only if the heap is properly maintained.
   - `heappush(min_heap, e)`: This pushes the removed element back into the heap. This is unnecessary and can be removed.
   - `heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))`: This pushes the updated cost and index of the current cell into the heap. This is correct.

4. **Return Value:**
   - `return row[-1]`: This returns the cost of the last support in the row. This is correct if the heap is properly maintained and the distance condition is met.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))`: This reads the input values for the number of rows, columns, bridges, and maximum distance.
   - `rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]`: This reads the depths of the river cells for each row. This is correct.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - `costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]`: This calculates the cost of building a bridge in each row using `func_1`. This is correct but depends on the correctness of `func_1`.

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - `total_costs = []`: This initializes an empty list to store the total costs of building \(k\) consecutive bridges.
   - `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1))`: This loop iterates over the possible starting rows for building \(k\) consecutive bridges.
   - `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))`: This calculates the total cost for building \(k\) consecutive bridges starting from row \(i\). This is correct.

4. **Output:**
   - `print(min(total_costs))`: This prints the minimum total cost of building \(k\) consecutive bridges. This is correct.

### Evaluation of `func_1`:

- **Distance Condition:**
  - The distance condition \(|j_1 - j_2| - 1 \leq d\) is not correctly enforced. The loop `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` should be `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - d - 1` to ensure the distance between supports is no more than \(d\).

- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The initial cost calculation `row[i] = row[i] + 2` for the first \(d\) cells is incorrect. It should be `row[i] = row[i] + 1`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly handle the condition that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than \(d\). The function `func_1` has issues with the distance condition and the initial cost calculation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
