To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to run.

### Loop Head Analysis:
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
```
- The loop will execute if `range(len(costs) - (k - 1))` generates a non-empty sequence.
- This means that `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 0.

### Conditions for Execution:
1. **`len(costs) - (k - 1) > 0`**:
   - This can be rewritten as `len(costs) > k - 1`.
   - Therefore, `len(costs)` must be at least `k`.

### Given State:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned values from the input.
- `rows` is a list of `n` lists.
- `costs` is a list of results obtained by applying `func_1` to each row in `rows` with the argument `d`.
- `total_costs` is an empty list.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `len(costs)` must be at least `k`.
- The variable `i` is the loop index and starts at 0.

### Final State:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned values from the input.
- `rows` is a list of `n` lists.
- `costs` is a list of results obtained by applying `func_1` to each row in `rows` with the argument `d`, and `len(costs)` must be at least `k`.
- `total_costs` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned values from the input, `rows` is a list of `n` lists, `costs` is a list of results obtained by applying `func_1` to each row in `rows` with the argument `d` and `len(costs)` must be at least `k`, `total_costs` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
