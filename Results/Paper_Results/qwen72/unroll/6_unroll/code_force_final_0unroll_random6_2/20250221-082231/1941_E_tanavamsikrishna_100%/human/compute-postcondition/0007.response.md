The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it reads input from the standard input. The first line of the input contains four integers: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, where:
- `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100` (indicating the number of rows and a specific row index),
- `3 ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5` (indicating the number of columns),
- `1 ≤ d ≤ m` (indicating a specific column index).

The following `n` lines each contain `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the first and last elements of each row being 0.

The function returns a value based on the input, but the specific return value is not provided in the constraints and relationships. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to read the specified input and process it to return a result based on the given parameters and river depths.

Functionality: **The function reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` (with constraints `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100`, `3 ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5`, and `1 ≤ d ≤ m`). The following `n` lines contain `m` integers each, representing the depths of the river cells, with the first and last elements of each row being 0. The function processes this input and returns a result based on the given parameters and river depths.**
