### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem describes a pattern where the first \( k \) people are numbered from 1 to \( k \), the next \( k-2 \) people are numbered from \( k-1 \) to 2, and this pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - Vasya knows his position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received. We need to determine how many different values of \( k \) (where \( k > 1 \)) fit this pattern for the given \( n \) and \( x \).

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - For a given \( k \), the sequence of numbers repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must satisfy the pattern. Specifically, \( n \) modulo \( 2k-2 \) should give a position that corresponds to \( x \) in the pattern.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \): This condition ensures that \( n + x - 2 \) is even, which is necessary for the pattern to fit.
     - \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \): This condition ensures that \( n - x \) is even, which is another necessary condition for the pattern to fit.
   - For each condition that is true, it calls `func_1` to find all divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It then checks if each divisor \( s \) plus 2 is even and if \( (s + 2) / 2 \) is greater than or equal to \( x \). If both conditions are met, it adds \( (s + 2) / 2 \) to the output list.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates from the output list and prints the length of the list.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of a given number \( x \).
   - It iterates from 1 to the square root of \( x \) and checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( i \). If so, it adds \( i \) and \( x / i \) to the output lists.
   - It then reverses the list of smaller divisors and combines it with the list of larger divisors to return a complete list of divisors.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the necessary conditions for \( n \) and \( x \) to fit the pattern.
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of a given number.
   - The program correctly filters the divisors to find valid \( k \) values and removes duplicates before printing the result.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified and uses the correct conditions and divisor checks to determine the number of valid \( k \) values.

Correctness: **True**
