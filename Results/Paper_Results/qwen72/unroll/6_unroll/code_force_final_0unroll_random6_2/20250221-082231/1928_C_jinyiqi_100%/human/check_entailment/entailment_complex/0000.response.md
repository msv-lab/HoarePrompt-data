### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the number of natural numbers \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) fit the given settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, with the sequence \( 1, 2, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers \( n \) and \( x \).
   - The output should be the number of different \( k \) that fit the given constraints for each test case.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates two potential values: \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It uses a function `func_1` to find all divisors of these values.
   - It then checks if the divisors, when adjusted, can be valid \( k \) values that fit the settling pattern.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of a given integer \( x \).
   - It returns a list of divisors in a specific order: divisors greater than the square root of \( x \) first, followed by divisors less than or equal to the square root of \( x \) in reversed order.

5. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks if \( (n + x - 2) \) and \( (n - x) \) are even.
   - If they are even, it finds their divisors using `func_1`.
   - It then checks if the divisors, when adjusted by adding 2 and dividing by 2, are valid \( k \) values (i.e., \( k \geq x \)).
   - It collects all valid \( k \) values in a list, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the list.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( k = 1 \) is not valid by ensuring \( k > 1 \).
   - It correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results for each.

7. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It correctly filters and adjusts these divisors to find valid \( k \) values.
   - The logic for determining valid \( k \) values is sound and aligns with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and logic. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
