The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`, where `x` is an integer such that \( 1 \le x \le 10^9 \). The function returns a list that combines two sub-lists: `output2`, which contains divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`, and `output1`, which contains divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reversed order.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list containing divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`, followed by divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reversed order.**
