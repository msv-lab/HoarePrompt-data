You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:

            output2.append(int(x / i))
        
    #State: `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` contains the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`.
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list that combines `output2` (containing divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`) and `output1` (containing divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reversed order).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values `n` and `x`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It iterates from 1 to the square root of `x` and checks if `i` is a divisor of `x`.
   - It appends both `i` and `x // i` to the list of divisors.
   - It reverses the first list of divisors and concatenates it with the second list to ensure all divisors are included.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks two conditions: `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0`.
   - For each condition, it calls `func_1` to find the divisors of the respective value.
   - It then filters these divisors to find valid `k` values:
     - `k` must be even and greater than or equal to `x`.
     - `(s + 2) / 2` is used to convert the divisor `s` to a potential `k` value.
   - It collects all valid `k` values in the `output` list, ensures they are unique by converting the list to a set, and then prints the length of the set.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k` must be greater than 1.
   - It also correctly handles the constraints `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`.

Given the problem description and the constraints, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
