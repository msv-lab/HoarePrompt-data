### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) fit the described pattern.
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the sequence of numbers assigned is: \( 1, 2, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), the position \( n \) must be congruent to \( x \) or \( 2k - 1 - x \) modulo \( 2k - 2 \).
   - This means \( n \equiv x \pmod{2k - 2} \) or \( n \equiv 2k - 1 - x \pmod{2k - 2} \).

3. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - From \( n \equiv x \pmod{2k - 2} \), we get \( n - x = m(2k - 2) \) for some integer \( m \).
   - From \( n \equiv 2k - 1 - x \pmod{2k - 2} \), we get \( n - (2k - 1 - x) = m(2k - 2) \) or \( n + x - 1 = m(2k - 2) \).

4. **Finding Divisors:**
   - We need to find all divisors of \( n - x \) and \( n + x - 1 \) that are of the form \( 2k - 2 \).
   - For each divisor \( d \), we solve \( 2k - 2 = d \) to get \( k = \frac{d + 2}{2} \).
   - \( k \) must be a natural number greater than 1, so \( d \) must be even and \( d + 2 \geq 2x \).

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) using the function `func_1`.
   - It then checks if each divisor \( d \) can form a valid \( k \) by ensuring \( d \) is even and \( k \geq x \).
   - Finally, it counts the number of unique valid \( k \) values and prints the result.

6. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of a given number \( x \).
   - It iterates from 1 to \( \sqrt{x} \) to find divisors and appends both the divisor and its corresponding quotient to the output lists.
   - The divisors are then combined and returned in a specific order: divisors greater than the square root of \( x \) first, followed by divisors less than or equal to the square root of \( x \) in reversed order.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where \( k = 1 \) is not valid by ensuring \( d \) is even and \( k \geq x \).
   - It also ensures that \( k \) is a natural number greater than 1 by checking \( d \) is even and \( k \geq x \).

8. **Efficiency:**
   - The program is efficient for the given constraints, as it only iterates up to \( \sqrt{x} \) to find divisors, which is \( O(\sqrt{x}) \).

### Validation Using Annotated Code:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - \( x \) is an integer such that \( 1 \le x \le 10^9 \).
- **Function `func_1` behavior:**
  - `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in the specified order.
  - The divisors are combined and returned as a list.

### Challenges to the Original Assessment:
- **Correctness of Divisor Calculation:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly calculates all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in the specified order.
- **Correctness of Valid \( k \) Calculation:**
  - The program correctly checks if each divisor \( d \) can form a valid \( k \) by ensuring \( d \) is even and \( k \geq x \).
- **Handling of Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where \( k = 1 \) is not valid by ensuring \( d \) is even and \( k \geq x \).

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid \( k \) values for each test case. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately. The efficiency of the program is also suitable for the given constraints.

Final: **True**
