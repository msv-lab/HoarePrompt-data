Output State: **The program returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.**

To break it down:
- `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers.
- If `extroverts` % 3 != 0, then the sum of the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 and the value of `universals` is greater than or equal to 3.
- The program calculates the sum of `extroverts` and `universals`, divides this sum by 3, and returns the ceiling of the result. This means the result is rounded up to the nearest whole number.
