### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Requirements:**
   - Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
   - Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two others.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - The condition `if extroverts % 3 != 0` checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3.
   - The condition `if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` checks if the remaining extroverts (after forming complete groups of 3) can be accommodated with the available universals.

3. **Flaw in `func_1`:**
   - The condition `if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` is not sufficient to ensure that each extrovert can be placed in a tent with exactly two others.
   - For example, consider the input `1 1 1`:
     - `extroverts = 1` and `universals = 1`.
     - `extroverts % 3 = 1`.
     - `extroverts % 3 + universals = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is less than 3.
     - The function returns `None`, and `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - However, the correct output should be `-1` because the extrovert cannot be placed in a tent with exactly two others, and the program incorrectly returns `1`.

4. **Correct Handling:**
   - To correctly handle the extroverts, we need to ensure that the remaining extroverts (after forming complete groups of 3) can be paired with universals to form groups of 3.
   - Specifically, if `extroverts % 3 == 1`, we need at least 2 universals to form a group of 3.
   - If `extroverts % 3 == 2`, we need at least 1 universal to form a group of 3.

5. **Example Test Case:**
   - For the input `1 1 1`:
     - `introverts = 1`, `extroverts = 1`, `universals = 1`.
     - `func_1(1, 1)` should return `None` because the extrovert cannot be placed in a tent with exactly two others.
     - `func_2(1, 1, 1)` should return `-1`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw in the program.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the remaining extroverts cannot be paired with universals to form groups of 3.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
