### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and the list `lst` of length `2n`.

2. **Splitting the List:**
   - The list `lst` is split into two halves: `lft` (first half) and `rgt` (second half).

3. **Sorting:**
   - Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted. This is a good step because it helps in identifying pairs of duplicate elements more easily.

4. **Identifying Pairs and Singles:**
   - The function uses two lists, `ldb` and `rdb`, to store pairs of duplicate elements from `lft` and `rgt` respectively.
   - It also uses a list `sng` to store single elements from `lft` that do not have a duplicate immediately next to them.

5. **Constructing the Subsets:**
   - The function constructs the subsets `l` and `r` by first trying to add pairs of duplicate elements from `ldb` and `rdb` to ensure the XOR condition.
   - If there are not enough pairs, it adds single elements from `sng` to complete the subsets.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the elements of `l` and `r` in the required format.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Handling Pairs:**
  - The code correctly identifies pairs of duplicate elements in `lft` and `rgt` and adds them to `ldb` and `rdb` respectively.
  - It then prints these pairs to form the subsets `l` and `r`.

- **Handling Singles:**
  - The code correctly identifies single elements in `lft` and adds them to `sng`.
  - It then prints these single elements to complete the subsets `l` and `r`.

- **XOR Condition:**
  - The XOR condition is satisfied by ensuring that the subsets `l` and `r` are constructed from the same elements (either pairs or singles).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles the edge case where `k` is 1 by ensuring that it prints the required number of elements.
  - It also handles the case where `k` is greater than 1 by ensuring that it prints the required number of pairs and singles.

### Potential Issues:
- **Single Elements in `sng`:**
  - The code only adds single elements from `lft` to `sng`, but it does not add single elements from `rgt`. This could lead to a situation where `sng` does not contain enough elements to complete the subsets `l` and `r` if `k` is large.

- **Subset Length:**
  - The code ensures that the subsets `l` and `r` have exactly `2k` elements, but it does not explicitly check if the XOR condition is met after constructing the subsets. However, since the problem guarantees that a solution always exists, this is not a critical issue.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct and follows the problem description. However, it has a minor issue with handling single elements from `rgt`. Despite this, the program should still produce valid subsets `l` and `r` that satisfy the XOR condition for the given problem constraints.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
