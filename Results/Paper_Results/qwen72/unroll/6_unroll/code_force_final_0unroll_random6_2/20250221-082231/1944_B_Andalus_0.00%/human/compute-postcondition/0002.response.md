Output State: **The loop processes `T` test cases. For each test case, after the loop executes, the variables `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` are updated based on the input for the next test case. The `sz` variable is reset to 0 at the beginning of each test case. The loop prints pairs of elements from `ldb` and `rdb` and single elements from `sng` up to `k` elements for each of the left and right halves of the list. After all iterations, the loop completes and the program ends.**
