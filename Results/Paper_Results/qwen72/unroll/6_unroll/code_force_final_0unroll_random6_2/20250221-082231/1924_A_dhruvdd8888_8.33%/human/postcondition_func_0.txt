The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and reads input from the user. It takes three inputs: `n`, `k`, and `m`, where `n` and `k` are integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26) and `m` is the length of a string `s` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) that consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function then processes the string `s` to find substrings that contain all `k` unique characters. If the number of such substrings found is at least `n`, it prints 'YES' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and, for each unique character in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that is not in the last found substring, it prints a string formed by concatenating the characters in the list of last found substrings, followed by the unique character, and then 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times. The final state of the program includes the variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` as described in the annotations.
