Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: n, k, and s. n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets.

    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the last character of each substring of `s` that contains all `k` unique characters, `ps` is the number of such substrings found in `s`.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None.
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the last character of each substring of `s` that contains all `k` unique characters, `ps` is the number of such substrings found in `s`, and `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: The loop prints a string for each unique character in `us` that is not in `win`. Each string is formed by concatenating the characters in `ans`, followed by the unique character from `us`, and then 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times. The variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and reads input from the user. It takes three inputs: `n`, `k`, and `m`, where `n` and `k` are integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26) and `m` is the length of a string `s` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) that consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function then processes the string `s` to find substrings that contain all `k` unique characters. If the number of such substrings found is at least `n`, it prints 'YES' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and, for each unique character in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that is not in the last found substring, it prints a string formed by concatenating the characters in the list of last found substrings, followed by the unique character, and then 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times. The final state of the program includes the variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` as described in the annotations.
