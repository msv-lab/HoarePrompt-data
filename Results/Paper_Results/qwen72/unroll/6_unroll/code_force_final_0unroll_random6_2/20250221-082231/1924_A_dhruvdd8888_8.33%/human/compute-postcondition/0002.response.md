Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**

Explanation:
- The code creates a set `us` that contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- The set `us` is generated by converting the integers from 0 to `k-1` to their corresponding ASCII characters (using `chr(i + 97)`), which are the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The set `us` now contains the characters from 'a' to the `k`-th character in the alphabet.
