Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the string `s`. The program only checks if a window of characters in `s` contains all `k` characters at least once, and then it tries to build a string of length `n` based on this window. This approach is flawed because it does not consider all possible combinations of the first `k` characters of length `n`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
**Input:**
```
3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
NO
aa
NO
ccc
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
NO
aa
NO
abc
```

In the third test case, the program incorrectly prints `abc` as a string that does not occur as a subsequence in `aabbccabab`. However, `abc` is a subsequence of `aabbccabab`. The correct output should be `ccc` or any other string of length 3 formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets that does not occur as a subsequence in `aabbccabab`.

The program fails to correctly identify and print a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s` when the answer is `NO`.
