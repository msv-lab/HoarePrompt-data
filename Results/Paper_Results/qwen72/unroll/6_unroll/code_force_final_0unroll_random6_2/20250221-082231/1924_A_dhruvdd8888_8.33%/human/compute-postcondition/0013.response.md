The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the set `us`. For the loop to execute, `us` must contain at least one element. Given the initial state, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `us` will always contain at least one element as long as `k` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the initialization of `i` to the first element of `us`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the last character of each substring of `s` that contains all `k` unique characters, `ps` is the number of such substrings found in `s`, and `ps` is less than `n`, `i` is the first element of `us`**
