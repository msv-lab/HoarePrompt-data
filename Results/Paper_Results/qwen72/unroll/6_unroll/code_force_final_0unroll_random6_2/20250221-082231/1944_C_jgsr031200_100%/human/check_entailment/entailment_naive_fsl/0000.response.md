Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the MEX by counting the frequency of each number in the array `arr`. However, it does not account for the optimal moves of both players, which is crucial to solving the problem correctly.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```

The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob would be:
1. Alice picks 2 (since it is the middle value and will help in maximizing the MEX).
2. Bob picks 0.
3. Alice picks 3.
4. Bob picks 1.
5. Alice picks 4.

At the end, the array `c` will be `[2, 3, 4]`, and the MEX of `c` is 1.

However, the program will output:
```
0
```

This is incorrect because the MEX of the array `c` should be 1, not 0. The program fails to consider the optimal moves of both players, leading to an incorrect result.
