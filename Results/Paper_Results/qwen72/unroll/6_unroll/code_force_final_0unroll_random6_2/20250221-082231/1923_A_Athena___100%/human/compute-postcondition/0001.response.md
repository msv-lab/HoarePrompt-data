The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate over the range of `t`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts, as it is automatically set by the `range(t)` function.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
