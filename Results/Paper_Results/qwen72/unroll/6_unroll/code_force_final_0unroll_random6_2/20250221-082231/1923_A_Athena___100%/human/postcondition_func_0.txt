The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of length `n` with elements 0 or 1, representing a ribbon with cells that are either free or contain a chip. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the ribbon. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` will be 0, and the variables `n`, `a`, and `res` will hold the values from the last test case processed, but these values will not be used further.
