Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` will be 0, as the loop has processed all `t` test cases. The variables `n` and `a` will be undefined or will hold the values from the last test case processed, but these values will not be used further. The variable `res` will hold the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) for the last test case processed, and this value will be printed.**
