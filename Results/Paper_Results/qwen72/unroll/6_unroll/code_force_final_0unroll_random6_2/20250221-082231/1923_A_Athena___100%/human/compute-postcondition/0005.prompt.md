You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 or 1, representing whether a cell is free or contains a chip, respectively. The input must be provided in a structured format, typically through standard input or a predefined input method, as the function itself does not take any parameters. Additionally, in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` will be 0, as the loop has processed all `t` test cases. The variables `n` and `a` will be undefined or will hold the values from the last test case processed, but these values will not be used further. The variable `res` will hold the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) for the last test case processed, and this value will be printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of length `n` with elements 0 or 1, representing a ribbon with cells that are either free or contain a chip. The function returns a result for each test case, which is not explicitly defined but likely relates to the arrangement or movement of chips in the ribbon.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
