Output State: **The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 or 1, representing whether a cell is free or contains a chip, respectively. The input must be provided in a structured format, typically through standard input or a predefined input method, as the function itself does not take any parameters. Additionally, in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip. `t` is the number of test cases to be processed, and `t` is an input integer.**
