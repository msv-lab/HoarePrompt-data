### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - You start by placing a white rook at position \((r, c)\), and the computer places a black rook at position \((c, r)\).
   - If \( r = c \), the computer skips its turn.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations after all possible moves are made, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
   - It then reads the \( k \) moves and processes them to determine the remaining valid positions for rooks.

3. **Processing Moves:**
   - For each move \((r, c)\):
     - If \( r \neq c \), both the row \( r \) and column \( c \) are occupied, reducing the available positions by 2.
     - If \( r = c \), only one position is occupied, reducing the available positions by 1.
   - This logic is correctly implemented in the loop where \( n \) is decremented accordingly.

4. **Dynamic Programming Function:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to compute the number of valid configurations for the remaining \( n \) positions.
   - The dynamic programming approach is used to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the board such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The recurrence relation \( dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2] \) is correct for this problem, as it accounts for placing a rook in a new row and column, and the two possible ways to place the rook in the previous row and column.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow and is within the required range.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the result of `func_1(n)` after processing the moves.
   - The `continue` statement is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Correctness:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The dynamic programming approach is sound, and the input parsing and move processing are accurate. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
