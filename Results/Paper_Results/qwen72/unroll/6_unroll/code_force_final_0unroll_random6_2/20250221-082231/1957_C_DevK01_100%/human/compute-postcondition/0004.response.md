The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, where `n` is an integer representing the size of the chessboard, and it is constrained such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5. The function returns the second last element in the list `dp`, which contains two elements: `dp[n]` and `dp[n-1]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the size of the chessboard (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and returns the second last element in the list `dp` that contains the values [dp[n], dp[n-1]].**
