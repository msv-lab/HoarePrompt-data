### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Assessment Challenge**:
   - The original assessment claims that the program does not handle the case when `n` is 1 and `k` is 0 correctly. However, this is not entirely accurate.
   - When `n` is 1 and `k` is 0, the function `func_1` is called with `n = 1`. The function `func_1` initializes `dp` as `[1, 1]` and then iterates from 2 to `n + 1`. Since `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, and the function returns `dp[-1]`, which is 1.
   - Therefore, the program correctly returns 1 for the case `n = 1` and `k = 0`, which is the correct number of configurations (the empty board).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` chessboard, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` is based on the recurrence relation:
     \[
     dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]
     \]
     where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an `i x i` board.
   - The base cases are `dp[0] = 1` (one way to place no rooks) and `dp[1] = 1` (one way to place one rook or none).
   - The function maintains a rolling list `dp` of the last two computed values to save memory and efficiently compute the result.

3. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and updates `n` based on whether the move is mirrored or not:
     - If `a != b`, both the player and the computer place rooks, reducing `n` by 2.
     - If `a == b`, only the player places a rook, reducing `n` by 1.
   - After processing the `k` moves, it calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations for the remaining board size `n`.

4. **Edge Cases and General Behavior**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n = 1` and `k = 0`.
   - For other values of `n` and `k`, the program correctly reduces `n` based on the moves and then uses `func_1` to compute the number of configurations.
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the dynamic programming solution to count the number of non-attacking rook placements.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the program does not handle the case `n = 1` and `k = 0` correctly. The program does return the correct result for this case.
- The program and the function `func_1` are correctly implemented to solve the problem as described.

Final: **True**
