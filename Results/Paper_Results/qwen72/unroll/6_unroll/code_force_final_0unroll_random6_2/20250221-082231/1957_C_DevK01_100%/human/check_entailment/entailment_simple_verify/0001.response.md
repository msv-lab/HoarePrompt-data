### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - You start by placing a white rook at position \((r, c)\), and the computer places a black rook at position \((c, r)\).
   - If \( r = c \), the computer skips its turn.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations after all possible moves are made, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
   - It then reads the \( k \) moves and processes them to determine the remaining valid positions for rooks.

3. **Processing Moves:**
   - For each move \((r, c)\):
     - If \( r \neq c \), both the row \( r \) and column \( c \) are occupied, reducing the available positions by 2.
     - If \( r = c \), only one position is occupied, reducing the available positions by 1.
   - This logic is correctly implemented in the loop where \( n \) is decremented accordingly.

4. **Dynamic Programming Function:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to compute the number of valid configurations for the remaining \( n \) positions.
   - The dynamic programming approach is used to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the board such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The recurrence relation \( dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2] \) is correct for this problem, as it accounts for placing a rook in a new row and column, and the two possible ways to place the rook in the previous row and column.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow and is within the required range.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the result of `func_1(n)` after processing the moves.
   - The `continue` statement is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Validation of Annotations:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `n` is an integer representing the size of the chessboard, such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5 \).
  - This is accurate, as the program correctly processes the moves and updates `n` accordingly.

- **State within the function `func_1`:**
  - `dp` is a list containing the values \([dp[n], dp[n-1]]\).
  - This is accurate, as the dynamic programming list is maintained correctly with the last two values needed for the recurrence relation.

- **Return Value:**
  - The program returns the value of `dp[n-1]`, which is the second last element in the list `dp` that contains the values \([dp[n], dp[n-1]]\).
  - This is accurate, as the function correctly returns the number of valid configurations for the remaining \( n \) positions.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The dynamic programming approach is sound, and the input parsing and move processing are accurate. The `continue` statement is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
