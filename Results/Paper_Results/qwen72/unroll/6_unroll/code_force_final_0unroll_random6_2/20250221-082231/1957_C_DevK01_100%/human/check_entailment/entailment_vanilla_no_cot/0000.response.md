Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem by:

1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
3. It then reads each move and updates the size of the board `n` based on whether the move is on the diagonal (where `a == b`) or not (where `a != b`):
   - If the move is on the diagonal, it reduces `n` by 1.
   - If the move is not on the diagonal, it reduces `n` by 2, because the computer will mirror the move, effectively blocking two positions.
4. It calculates the number of possible final configurations using a dynamic programming approach in the function `func_1(n)`.
5. The dynamic programming function `func_1(n)` uses a rolling array to keep track of the number of ways to place rooks on a board of size `i` without any two rooks attacking each other. The recurrence relation used is:
   - `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` (mod \(10^9 + 7\))
   - This relation accounts for the fact that you can place a rook in the current row in two ways (either on a new column or mirroring a previous move), and the remaining configurations are derived from the previous states.

The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements, ensuring that the number of configurations is computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Therefore, the program is correct.
