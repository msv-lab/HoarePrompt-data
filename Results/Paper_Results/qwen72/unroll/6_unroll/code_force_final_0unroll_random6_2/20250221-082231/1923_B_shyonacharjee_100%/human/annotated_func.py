#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains (n, k, a, x) with n being an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, k being an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, a being a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and x being a list of n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        
        bullets_used = 0
        
        can_survive = True
        
        for pos, health in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, `cases` remains unchanged, and the loop prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the player can survive the attack of the monsters. The variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `x`, `monsters`, `bullets_used`, and `can_survive` are reinitialized for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` and processes `t` test cases. Each test case consists of four inputs: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`. It determines whether a player can survive an attack from `n` monsters, where each monster has a position `x_i` and health `a_i`. The player can survive if the total number of bullets needed to defeat all monsters (sum of their health) does not exceed the maximum number of bullets the player can shoot, which is `k` times the distance of the farthest monster. The function prints 'YES' if the player can survive and 'NO' otherwise for each test case. The function does not return any value.
