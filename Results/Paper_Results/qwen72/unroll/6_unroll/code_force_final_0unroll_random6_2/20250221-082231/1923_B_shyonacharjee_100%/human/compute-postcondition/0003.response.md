The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t` which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, and a parameter `cases` which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in `cases` contains four elements: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`. Here, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `x` is a list of `n` integers where the elements are strictly increasing and satisfy -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function processes each tuple in the `cases` list and returns a list of results for each case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple in `cases` contains four elements: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`. It processes each tuple and returns a list of results for each case.**
