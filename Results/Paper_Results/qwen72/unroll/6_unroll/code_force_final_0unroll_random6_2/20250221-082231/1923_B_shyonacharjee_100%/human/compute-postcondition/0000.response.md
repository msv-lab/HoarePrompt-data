Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains (n, k, a, x) with n being an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, k being an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, a being a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and x being a list of n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
