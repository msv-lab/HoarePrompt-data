The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly assigned a value, but it will be incremented from 0 to `t-1` as the loop runs.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4
- `cases` is a list of tuples with specific constraints

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `t` is at least 1. The placeholder `_` will start at 0 and increment up to `t-1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `_` is 0**
