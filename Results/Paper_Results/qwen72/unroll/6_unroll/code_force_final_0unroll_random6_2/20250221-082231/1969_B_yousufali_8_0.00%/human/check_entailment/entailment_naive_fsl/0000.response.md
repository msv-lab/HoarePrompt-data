Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` reads the input as a list of integers, which is incorrect because the input is a binary string, not a list of integers. This will cause the program to fail when it tries to process the input. Additionally, the logic for calculating the minimum cost to sort the binary string is flawed. The function does not account for the cyclic shifts correctly and does not handle the edge cases as described in the problem statement. For example, for the input "101011", the program will not produce the correct output of 5.
