### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the input using `input().split()`, which is incorrect for this problem. The input is a binary string, not a list of integers. The `split()` method will split the string by spaces, which is not what we want. Instead, we should read the string directly and convert it to a list of integers.
   - Correct input handling should be: `s = list(map(int, list(input().strip())))`.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Minimum Cost**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the minimum cost by counting the number of consecutive 1s (`n`) and adding `n + 1` to the answer (`ans`) whenever a 0 is encountered.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the cyclic nature of the shifts. The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order, which means we need to consider the entire string and the optimal way to shift it.
   - The correct approach involves finding the number of transitions from 1 to 0 in the string and using this to determine the minimum cost. If there are no transitions (i.e., the string is already sorted), the cost is 0. If there are transitions, the cost is the length of the string minus the length of the longest segment of consecutive 1s or 0s.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, for the input "101011", the program will not produce the correct output of 5. The correct logic should consider the entire string and the optimal way to shift it to achieve a sorted order.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, list(input().strip())))
    n = len(s)
    ans = 0
    max_segment = 0
    current_segment = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 1:
            current_segment += 1
        else:
            max_segment = max(max_segment, current_segment)
            current_segment = 0
    max_segment = max(max_segment, current_segment)
    
    # Count the number of transitions from 1 to 0
    transitions = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == 1 and s[i + 1] == 0:
            transitions += 1
    if s[-1] == 1 and s[0] == 0:
        transitions += 1
    
    # If there are no transitions, the string is already sorted
    if transitions == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(n - max_segment)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is **accurate**. The provided program is incorrect due to the following reasons:
- Incorrect input handling: `input().split()` should be replaced with `list(map(int, list(input().strip())))`.
- Flawed logic for calculating the minimum cost: The program does not correctly account for the cyclic nature of the shifts and does not handle edge cases properly.

**Final: False**
