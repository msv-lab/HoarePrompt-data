The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in the list. The function does not modify the `numbers` list or any other external variables. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, as they are not part of the function's parameters or internal state.
