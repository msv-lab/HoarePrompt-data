### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculation of `m`**:
   - The program calculates `m` as the product of all elements in `k`. This step is intended to find a common multiple that can be used to determine the bets. However, this approach is not necessary and can lead to very large numbers, which might not be optimal.

3. **Calculation of Bets**:
   - The program then calculates the bets `c` for each outcome as `m / k[i]`. This ensures that the bet on the i-th outcome, when multiplied by `k[i]`, will give `m`.

4. **Finding the HCF**:
   - The program calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of the bets using the `func_1` function. This step is intended to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same ratios.

5. **Checking the Condition**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the reduced bets is strictly less than `m / hcf`. If this condition is not met, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution of coins exists.
   - If the condition is met, it prints the reduced bets.

6. **Output**:
   - The output format is correct, printing either `-1` or the list of bets for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Calculation of `m`**: The calculation of `m` as the product of all elements in `k` can lead to very large numbers, which might cause integer overflow or unnecessary complexity. A more efficient approach would be to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, but even this is not strictly necessary.
- **Reduction of Bets**: The reduction of bets using the HCF is a good approach to ensure the bets are as small as possible while maintaining the required condition. However, the condition `sum(c) >= m / hcf` might not always be correct. The correct condition should be `sum(c) >= m / hcf` for any valid solution, but the program should ensure that `sum(c) < m / hcf` for all outcomes.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic is generally sound, but the calculation of `m` as the product of all elements in `k` is not optimal and can lead to large numbers. However, the program does correctly check the condition and outputs the bets or `-1` accordingly.

### Conclusion:
- Despite the non-optimal calculation of `m`, the program still meets the requirements of the problem and will produce the correct output for the given constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
