Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculation of Multiplied Product**: The program calculates the product of all multipliers `k[i]` and stores it in `m`. This product `m` is used to determine the initial bets for each outcome.

3. **Initial Bets Calculation**: The program calculates the initial bets `c` for each outcome by dividing `m` by each multiplier `k[i]`. This ensures that the bet on the i-th outcome is a multiple of the other multipliers, which is a good starting point for ensuring that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

4. **Finding the HCF**: The program calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of the initial bets `c` using the `func_1` function. This is done to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same relative ratios.

5. **Reducing Bets**: The program reduces the bets by dividing each initial bet by the HCF. This step ensures that the bets are as small as possible while still maintaining the required condition.

6. **Checking the Condition**: The program checks if the sum of the reduced bets is strictly less than the product `m` divided by the HCF. If this condition is not met, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution of bets is possible. Otherwise, it prints the reduced bets.

7. **Output**: The program outputs the bets for each test case as required, or `-1` if no valid distribution is possible.

**Potential Issues**:
- The program calculates `m` as the product of all multipliers `k[i]`. This can lead to very large numbers, especially when `n` is large. However, the problem guarantees that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), and the multipliers are between 2 and 20, so the product `m` should still be manageable within the constraints.
- The program uses integer division to reduce the bets, which is correct in this context since the HCF will always divide the bets evenly.

**Correctness**:
- The program correctly handles the input and output formats.
- The logic for calculating the bets and checking the condition is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
- The use of the HCF to reduce the bets ensures that the bets are minimized while maintaining the required condition.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
