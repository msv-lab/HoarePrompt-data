Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) and a list of integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 <= k_i <= 20). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `hcf` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `numbers`.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value of the first element in the list `numbers` to the variable `hcf`. The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
