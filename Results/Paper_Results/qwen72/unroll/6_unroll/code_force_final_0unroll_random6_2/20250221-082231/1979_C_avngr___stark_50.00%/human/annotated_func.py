#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, test_cases is a list of tuples, each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) and a list of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in the list `numbers` for each test case in `test_cases`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in the list `numbers` for each test case in `test_cases`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in the list. The function does not modify the `numbers` list or any other external variables. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, as they are not part of the function's parameters or internal state.
