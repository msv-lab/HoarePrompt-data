You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    7 9 3 17 9 13
    
    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in the list `numbers` for each test case in `test_cases`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in the list. The function does not modify the `numbers` list or any other external variables. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, as they are not part of the function's parameters or internal state.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given multiple test cases, each with a set of multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).
   - We need to distribute coins \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that the total sum of bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \) is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome \( k_i \cdot x_i \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers \( m = \prod_{i=1}^{n} k_i \).
   - It then calculates the bets \( c_i \) as \( c_i = \frac{m}{k_i} \).
   - The highest common factor (HCF) of the bets \( c \) is computed using the `func_1` function.
   - Each bet \( c_i \) is then divided by the HCF to ensure the bets are as small as possible.
   - The program checks if the sum of the bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i \) is strictly less than \( \frac{m}{\text{HCF}} \). If it is, the bets are valid; otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The product \( m \) is used to ensure that the bets \( c_i \) are proportional to the multipliers \( k_i \).
   - Dividing each \( c_i \) by the HCF ensures that the bets are the smallest possible integers that satisfy the proportionality.
   - The condition \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i < \frac{m}{\text{HCF}} \) ensures that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same, the HCF will be \( k_i \) itself, and the sum of bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i \) will be \( n \), which is not less than \( \frac{m}{k_i} = k_i^{n-1} \). This is correctly handled by the program.
   - If the multipliers are different, the program correctly calculates the bets and checks the condition.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module to compute the HCF, which is efficient.
   - The product \( m \) can be large, but the program handles it by dividing by the HCF, ensuring the bets are within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome and checks if the condition is satisfied. It handles edge cases and ensures the bets are within the required constraints.
