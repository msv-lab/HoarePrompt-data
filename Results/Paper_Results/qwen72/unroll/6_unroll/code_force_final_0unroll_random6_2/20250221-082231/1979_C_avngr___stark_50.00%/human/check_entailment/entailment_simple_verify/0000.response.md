### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the original assessment to understand the correctness.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of outcomes `n` and their multipliers `k` for each test case.

2. **Calculation of `m`:**
   - The program calculates `m` as the product of all multipliers `k_i`. This is correct and necessary for the subsequent steps.

3. **Calculation of `c`:**
   - The program calculates `c` as the list of values `m / k_i` for each outcome. This is also correct and necessary.

4. **Calculation of HCF (GCD):**
   - The program calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of the list `c` using the `func_1` function, which correctly computes the GCD of the list.

5. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the list `c` (after dividing each element by the HCF) is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`. If it is, the program outputs \(-1\). Otherwise, it outputs the list `c`.

6. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same and the sum of `c` is equal to \( m / \text{hcf} \). However, this is a misunderstanding of the problem constraints and the program's logic.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Case where all \( k_i \) are the same:**
  - For example, consider the input:
    ```
    1
    3
    5 5 5
    ```
  - The program will calculate \( m \) as \( 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125 \).
  - The list \( c \) will be \([25, 25, 25]\).
  - The HCF of \( c \) will be 25.
  - The sum of \( c \) will be \( 25 + 25 + 25 = 75 \), which is not greater than \( 125 / 25 = 5 \).
  - Therefore, the program will output \(-1\), which is correct because the sum of the bets (75) is not strictly less than the total coins received back for any winning outcome (125 / 25 = 5).

- **Case where the sum of `c` is equal to \( m / \text{hcf} \):**
  - For example, consider the input:
    ```
    1
    2
    3 3
    ```
  - The program will calculate \( m \) as \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \).
  - The list \( c \) will be \([3, 3]\).
  - The HCF of \( c \) will be 3.
  - The sum of \( c \) will be \( 3 + 3 = 6 \), which is not greater than \( 9 / 3 = 3 \).
  - Therefore, the program will output \(-1\), which is correct because the sum of the bets (6) is not strictly less than the total coins received back for any winning outcome (9 / 3 = 3).

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is incorrect in its claim that the program does not handle the case where all \( k_i \) are the same and the sum of `c` is equal to \( m / \text{hcf} \). The program correctly outputs \(-1\) in such cases, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
