Output State: `t` is now an input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values from pairs of integers for each iteration of the outer loop. Each iteration of the outer loop processes a new set of `n * 2` integers, and the sum of the minimum values from these pairs is appended to `ans_f`. The length of `ans_f` will be equal to `t`.
