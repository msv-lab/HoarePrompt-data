Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided Python program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect List Manipulation**: The program attempts to remove elements from the list `lst` using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`. This is incorrect because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are always `0` and `2`, respectively, which means the program is trying to remove elements at fixed indices, not the elements that were just compared. This will lead to incorrect results and potential index errors.

2. **Inefficient and Incorrect Loop**: The loop `for i in range(n * 2):` is intended to perform the move `n` times, but it is iterating over `2n` elements. This is unnecessary and incorrect. The loop should only run `n` times.

3. **Sorting and Pairing**: To maximize the score, you should always pair the smallest two numbers. This can be achieved by sorting the list and then summing the first `n` elements (since the first `n` elements in a sorted list of `2n` elements will always be the smaller elements in each pair).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
        lst.sort()
        ans = sum(lst[:n])
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
2. **Sorting the List**: For each test case, it reads the list of `2n` integers, converts them to integers, and sorts the list.
3. **Summing the First `n` Elements**: After sorting, the first `n` elements are the smallest elements in each pair. Summing these elements gives the maximum score.
4. **Storing and Printing Results**: The results are stored in a list `ans_f` and printed at the end.

This corrected program will correctly solve the problem as described.
