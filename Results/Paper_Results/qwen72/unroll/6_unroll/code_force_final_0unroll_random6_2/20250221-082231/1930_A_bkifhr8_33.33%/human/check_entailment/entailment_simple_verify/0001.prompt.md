You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).

        ans = 0

        ans_f.append(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is the same input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the sum of the minimum values of pairs from the input lists.
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
        
    #State: The loop prints each element in the list `ans_f`, which contains `t` elements, each being the sum of the minimum values of pairs from the input lists. The variables `t` and `ans_f` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of integers `lst`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes the score `ans` to 0 for each test case and prepares a list `ans_f` to store the results of each test case.

3. **Processing the List**:
   - The program splits the input string `l` into a list of strings `lst`.
   - It then iterates `n * 2` times, which is the length of the list `lst` for each test case.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the length of `lst` is not 2. If it is not 2, it adds the minimum of the first two elements to the score `ans` and removes these two elements from the list.
   - If the length of `lst` is 2, it adds the minimum of the remaining two elements to the score `ans` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output**: After processing all test cases, the program prints the results stored in `ans_f`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **List Removal Logic**: The program uses `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`, which are incorrect. The expression `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` will always evaluate to 0 and 2, respectively, regardless of the iteration. This will lead to incorrect elements being removed from the list.
- **Efficiency**: The program does not sort the list, which is a crucial step to ensure that the minimum values are always selected optimally. Sorting the list and then selecting pairs from the beginning will guarantee the maximum score.
- **List Length Check**: The check `if len(lst) != 2` is unnecessary and can be simplified. The loop should simply iterate `n` times, selecting pairs from the sorted list.

To correct these issues, the program should:

1. Sort the list `lst` before processing.
2. Iterate `n` times, selecting pairs from the beginning of the sorted list.
3. Remove the unnecessary length check.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
        lst.sort()
        ans = sum(lst[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)
```

Explanation of the corrected program:
- **Sorting**: `lst.sort()` ensures that the smallest elements are at the beginning of the list.
- **Summing Minimums**: `sum(lst[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))` sums the minimum values of each pair by selecting every second element from the sorted list.
- **Efficiency**: This approach is more efficient and guarantees the correct result.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
