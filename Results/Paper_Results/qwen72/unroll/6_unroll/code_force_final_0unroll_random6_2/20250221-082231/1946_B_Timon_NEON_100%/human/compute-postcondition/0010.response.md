The only objects in the loop head are `segment` and `segments_variants`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `segments_variants` list. If `segments_variants` has at least one sublist, the loop will execute. The state of `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and `total_max_segment` do not directly affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `segments_variants` must have at least one sublist, and `segment` should be the first sublist in `segments_variants`.

State: **`new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [sum of all positive numbers in `arr`, index of the last positive number in `arr`], `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must have at least one sublist, `segment` is the first sublist in `segments_variants`, `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is [-1]**
