You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr).
def func_2(arr):
    new_segment = []
    max_segment = [0, 0]
    segments_variants = []
    max_sum = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if new_segment:
            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])

            else:
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]

    #State: `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [sum of all positive numbers in `arr`, index of the last positive number in `arr`], `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the sum of a segment of positive numbers and the start and end indices of that segment, `max_sum` is -1.
    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    total_max_segment = [-1]
    for segment in segments_variants:
        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
            total_max_segment = segment
        
    #State: `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [sum of all positive numbers in `arr`, index of the last positive number in `arr`], `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the sum of a segment of positive numbers and the start and end indices of that segment, and the last sublist in `segments_variants` is now `[sum of all positive numbers in `arr`, index of the last positive number in `arr`, len(arr) - 1, len(arr) - 1]`, `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is [sum of all positive numbers in `arr`, index of the last positive number in `arr`, len(arr) - 1, len(arr) - 1].
    return total_max_segment
    #The program returns a list `total_max_segment` that contains the sum of all positive numbers in `arr`, the index of the last positive number in `arr`, `len(arr) - 1`, and `len(arr) - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a list `total_max_segment` containing the sum of all positive numbers in `arr`, the index of the last positive number in `arr`, and the value `len(arr) - 1` repeated twice.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `total_max_segment` that contains the sum of all positive numbers in `arr`, the index of the last positive number in `arr`, `len(arr) - 1`, and `len(arr) - 1`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
