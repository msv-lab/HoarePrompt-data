You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26) from the input. It then prints a string that consists of the first `k` letters of the English alphabet repeated `n` times. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the state of the program includes the updated values of `n` and `k` based on the last test case, while `t` remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The string `s` should be of the smallest possible length.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution constructs the string `s` by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.
   - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `s` would be `abcabc`.

3. **Checking the Correctness:**
   - **Subsequence Requirement:**
     - The string `s` generated by the solution is `('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)`.
     - This means `s` is a repetition of the first `k` alphabets `n` times.
     - For any string of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets, it can be found as a subsequence in `s` because each character in the string of length `n` will appear at least `n` times in `s`.
   - **Smallest Length:**
     - The length of the string `s` is `k * n`.
     - This length is not necessarily the smallest possible length that satisfies the subsequence requirement.
     - For example, for `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the solution generates `abab`, but the smallest possible string that satisfies the requirement is `baab`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The solution generates a string that satisfies the subsequence requirement, but it does not necessarily generate the smallest possible string.
   - Therefore, the solution is incorrect based on the requirement to find the smallest possible string.
