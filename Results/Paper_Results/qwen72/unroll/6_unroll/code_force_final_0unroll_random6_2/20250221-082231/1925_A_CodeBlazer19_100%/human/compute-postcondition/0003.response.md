The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function should be called with two arguments, `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not described in the provided output section. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k` within the specified range and return a value based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, and returns a value based on these inputs.**
