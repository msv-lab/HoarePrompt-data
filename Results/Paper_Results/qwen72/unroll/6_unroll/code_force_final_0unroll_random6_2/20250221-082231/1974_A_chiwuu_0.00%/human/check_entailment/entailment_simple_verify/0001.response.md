### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5 rows x 3 columns).
   - The variable `t` is calculated as `b * 2` because each 2x2 icon requires 2 rows (since 2x2 icons can be placed in a 2x2 block, and each screen has 5 rows, so 2 rows per 2x2 icon).
   - The program then checks if `t` is divisible by 5. If it is, `t` is set to `t // 5`. If not, `t` is set to `t // 5 + 1`. This ensures that the number of screens is rounded up to the nearest whole number.
   - **Note**: This part is correct, but it can be simplified using the `math.ceil` function for clarity.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons on the screens already allocated: `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - It then checks if the remaining space on these screens is enough to place all 1x1 icons (`a`). If it is, the number of screens remains `t`.
   - **Note**: This part is also correct. The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` correctly determines the remaining space on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons.

4. **Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining space is not enough for all 1x1 icons, the program calculates the additional number of screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - The variable `t2` is set to `a - t1`, which represents the number of 1x1 icons that cannot fit in the already allocated screens.
   - The program then checks if `t2` is divisible by 15. If it is, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15`. If not, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15 + 1` to account for the additional screen needed.
   - **Note**: This part is correct. The calculation `t2 = a - t1` and the subsequent rounding up to the nearest whole number of screens is accurate.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.
   - **Note**: The output is correctly formatted and matches the problem description.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Test Case 1: (1, 1)**
  - `b = 1` requires 2 rows, so `t = 1` screen.
  - Remaining space: `15 - 4 = 11` cells.
  - `a = 1` fits in the remaining 11 cells, so the total number of screens is `1`.
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 2: (7, 2)**
  - `b = 2` requires 4 rows, so `t = 1` screen.
  - Remaining space: `15 - 8 = 7` cells.
  - `a = 7` fits in the remaining 7 cells, so the total number of screens is `1`.
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 3: (12, 4)**
  - `b = 4` requires 8 rows, so `t = 2` screens.
  - Remaining space: `2 * 15 - 16 = 14` cells.
  - `a = 12` fits in the remaining 14 cells, so the total number of screens is `2`.
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 4: (0, 3)**
  - `b = 3` requires 6 rows, so `t = 2` screens.
  - Remaining space: `2 * 15 - 12 = 18` cells.
  - `a = 0` fits in the remaining 18 cells, so the total number of screens is `2`.
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 5: (1, 0)**
  - `b = 0` requires 0 rows, so `t = 0` screens.
  - Remaining space: `0 * 15 - 0 = 0` cells.
  - `a = 1` requires 1 more screen, so the total number of screens is `1`.
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 6: (8, 1)**
  - `b = 1` requires 2 rows, so `t = 1` screen.
  - Remaining space: `15 - 4 = 11` cells.
  - `a = 8` fits in the remaining 11 cells, so the total number of screens is `1`.
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 7: (0, 0)**
  - `b = 0` requires 0 rows, so `t = 0` screens.
  - Remaining space: `0 * 15 - 0 = 0` cells.
  - `a = 0` fits in the remaining 0 cells, so the total number of screens is `0`.
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 8: (2, 0)**
  - `b = 0` requires 0 rows, so `t = 0` screens.
  - Remaining space: `0 * 15 - 0 = 0` cells.
  - `a = 2` requires 1 more screen, so the total number of screens is `1`.
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 9: (15, 0)**
  - `b = 0` requires 0 rows, so `t = 0` screens.
  - Remaining space: `0 * 15 - 0 = 0` cells.
  - `a = 15` requires 1 more screen, so the total number of screens is `1`.
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 10: (8, 2)**
  - `b = 2` requires 4 rows, so `t = 1` screen.
  - Remaining space: `15 - 8 = 7` cells.
  - `a = 8` requires 1 more screen, so the total number of screens is `2`.
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 11: (0, 9)**
  - `b = 9` requires 18 rows, so `t = 4` screens.
  - Remaining space: `4 * 15 - 36 = 24` cells.
  - `a = 0` fits in the remaining 24 cells, so the total number of screens is `4`.
  - **Correct**.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons based on the given problem description. The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
