You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

        a = int(a)

        print(t)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, x and y, where x is the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and y is the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon. Both x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.

    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)

        print(t)
        
    #State: The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and the loop prints the value of `t` for each iteration based on the input values `a` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads `n` pairs of integers `(a, b)` from the user, where `a` represents the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `b` represents the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. For each pair, it calculates and prints the minimum number of 15 × 15 grid cells required to display all the icons, considering the different sizes of the icons. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of 1x1 icons (a) and 2x2 icons (b) requires a specific arrangement that the current logic does not account for. Specifically, the program calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons first and then tries to fit the 1x1 icons into the remaining space. However, this approach can lead to an incorrect result in scenarios where the 1x1 icons could be placed more efficiently.

For example, consider the input `x = 14` and `y = 1`. According to the problem, the optimal arrangement would be to place the 2x2 icon on one screen and the 1x1 icons on another screen, which would require 2 screens in total. However, the program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icon first, which is 1 screen, and then tries to fit the 1x1 icons into the remaining space. The remaining space on the first screen is 11 cells (15 - 4), which is not enough for 14 1x1 icons. The program then calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 3 1x1 icons, which would be 1 screen. Thus, the program outputs 2 screens, which is incorrect because the optimal arrangement would require only 2 screens.

To illustrate:
- Screen 1: 1x1 icons (11) + 1x 2x2 icon (4) = 15 cells
- Screen 2: 1x1 icons (3) = 3 cells

The correct output should be 2 screens, but the program outputs 3 screens. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
