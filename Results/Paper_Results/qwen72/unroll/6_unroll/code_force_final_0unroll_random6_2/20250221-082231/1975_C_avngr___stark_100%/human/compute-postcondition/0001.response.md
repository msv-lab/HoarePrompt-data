The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is not used within the loop. 

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder**
