The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, each containing an array `a` of positive integers. The input to the function is not directly provided in the function definition but is described as follows: the first input is the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), followed by `t` test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`, followed by `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array `a`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
