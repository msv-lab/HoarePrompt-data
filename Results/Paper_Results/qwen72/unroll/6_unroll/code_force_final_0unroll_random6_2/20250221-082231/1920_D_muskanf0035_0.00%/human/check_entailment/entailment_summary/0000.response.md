Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly processes the operations and queries as described in the problem.
   - For operation type 1, it appends the value to the array, which is correct.
   - For operation type 2, it duplicates the array by extending it with its current elements, which is also correct.
   - After processing all operations, it handles the queries by accessing the elements at the indices `(k - 1) % len(array)`. This is correct because the array is periodic after each operation of type 2, and the modulo operation ensures that the index wraps around correctly.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the number of operations and queries, respectively.
   - It reads the operations and queries and passes them to `func_1`.
   - It prints the results returned by `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct and matches the problem description.
   - The output format in `func_2` is correct, printing the results for each test case as required.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function `func_1` handles the case where the array is empty before an operation of type 2, as guaranteed by the problem statement.
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles large values of `x` in operation type 2 by extending the array with its current elements, which ensures the periodicity of the array.
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles large values of `k` in the queries by using the modulo operation, which ensures that the index is within the bounds of the array.

5. **Performance Considerations**:
   - The function `func_1` may have performance issues for very large values of `x` in operation type 2, as it extends the array by its current length. However, the problem constraints ensure that the array size does not exceed `10^18`, and the modulo operation ensures that the queries are handled efficiently.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles the input and output as required.

Correctness: **True**
