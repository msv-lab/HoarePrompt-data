Correctness: **False**

The given program has a fundamental flaw in how it handles the second type of operation (b=2). Specifically, the program attempts to extend the array by `x` copies, but it only extends by one copy of the current array. This will lead to incorrect results for larger values of `x`.

Here's the problematic part of the code in `func_1`:

```python
else:
    array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
```

This code should be:

```python
else:
    current_array = array.copy()
    for _ in range(x - 1):
        array.extend(current_array)
```

However, even with this correction, the program will still be inefficient for large values of `x` and `n`, as it will attempt to create an array that can grow to an impractically large size. Instead, a more efficient approach would be to keep track of the length of the array and the operations in a way that allows you to determine the value at any index without actually constructing the entire array.

Here's a more efficient approach:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    lengths = [0]
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
            lengths.append(lengths[-1] + 1)
        else:
            current_length = lengths[-1]
            new_length = current_length * value
            lengths.append(new_length)
    
    def find_element(k):
        for i in range(len(lengths) - 1, 0, -1):
            if k > lengths[i - 1]:
                k -= lengths[i - 1]
                if k <= lengths[i] - lengths[i - 1]:
                    return array[k - 1]
        return array[0]
    
    result = [find_element(k) for k in queries]
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)
```

This approach keeps track of the lengths of the array after each operation and uses a function to find the element at a given index efficiently. This avoids the need to construct the entire array, which can be very large.
