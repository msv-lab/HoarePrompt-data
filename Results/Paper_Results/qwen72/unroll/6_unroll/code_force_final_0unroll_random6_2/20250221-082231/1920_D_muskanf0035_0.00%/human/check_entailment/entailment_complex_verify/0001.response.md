### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires simulating operations on an initially empty array and answering queries about the k-th element of the resulting array.
   - Operations can either append a single integer to the array or append multiple copies of the current array to itself.
   - The array can grow very large, especially with the second type of operation, which can lead to performance and memory issues.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty array `array` and an empty list `result` to store the results of the queries.
   - **Operation Handling**:
     - For `op_type == 1`, the function appends the integer `value` to the array. This is correct.
     - For `op_type == 2`, the function appends `value` copies of the current array to itself. This is implemented using a list comprehension that extends the array with `value` copies of its current state. However, this can be very inefficient and memory-intensive, especially for large values of `value`.
   - **Query Handling**: After all operations are performed, the function iterates through the queries and appends the k-th element of the array to the `result` list. The k-th element is determined by `(k - 1) % len(array)`, which is correct and ensures that the k-th element is correctly determined even if the array is repeated multiple times.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - **Reading Operations and Queries**: For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`. It then reads the operations and queries.
   - **Calling Function 1**: It calls `func_1` with the number of operations, the list of operations, and the list of queries.
   - **Output**: It prints the results of the queries for each test case.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Memory and Performance**: The current implementation of `func_1` can be inefficient and memory-intensive, especially for large values of `x` in the second type of operation. For example, if `x` is very large, the array can grow exponentially, leading to performance issues or memory errors.
   - **Efficiency**: The program does not handle large inputs efficiently, which is a significant concern given the problem constraints (e.g., `1 <= x <= 10^9` and `1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c)`).

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic for handling the operations and queries is correct in terms of the algorithm.
   - However, the implementation is not efficient for large inputs, which could lead to performance issues or memory errors in practical scenarios.
   - The problem description does not explicitly require efficiency, but it is implied by the constraints. A more efficient solution would be necessary to handle the upper bounds of the input values.

### Final Evaluation:
- **Theoretical Correctness**: The program is logically correct and will produce the correct output for small inputs.
- **Practical Correctness**: Given the constraints, the program is not practical and may fail due to memory or performance issues for large inputs.

Final: **False**

The program is theoretically correct in terms of its logic, but it is not efficient enough to handle the large input constraints specified in the problem. Therefore, it should be considered incorrect for practical purposes.
