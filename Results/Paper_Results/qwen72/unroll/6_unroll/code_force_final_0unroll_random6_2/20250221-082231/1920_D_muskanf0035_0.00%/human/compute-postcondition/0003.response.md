The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n`: a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5.
- `q`: a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5.
- `operations`: a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers `b` and `x`. Here, `b` is either 1 or 2, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n if `b=1`, and 1 <= x <= 10^9 if `b=2`.
- `queries`: a list of `q` integers, each representing a query index `k_i` such that 1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c), where `c` is the size of the array after all operations.

The function processes the operations and then returns the results of the queries based on the final state of the array. Each operation modifies the array, and each query retrieves a value from the array at a specified index.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries`. It processes a series of operations on an array and returns the results of the queries based on the final state of the array.**
