Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying the issue with the second type of operation. The problem description specifies that for an operation of type 2, the array should be extended by `x` copies of itself. However, the provided program only appends one copy of the array, which is incorrect.

Let's break down the issue and the expected behavior:

1. **Operation Type 1**:
   - The program correctly appends the integer `value` to the array `array` when `op_type` is 1.

2. **Operation Type 2**:
   - The program should append `x` copies of the current array to itself.
   - The current implementation in `func_1` only appends one copy of the array, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
```
1
5 10
1 1
1 2
2 2
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20
```

- After the first operation: `array = [1]`
- After the second operation: `array = [1, 2]`
- After the third operation (type 2, `x = 2`): The array should become `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`, but the program only appends one copy, resulting in `[1, 2, 1, 2]`.
- After the fourth operation: `array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`
- After the fifth operation (type 2, `x = 3`): The array should become `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`, but the program only appends one copy, resulting in `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.

This discrepancy leads to incorrect results for queries that depend on the repeated structure of the array. For instance, the query for the 14th element should return 1, but the program returns 1, which is correct only by coincidence due to the incorrect array size.

To fix this, the code for the second type of operation should be modified to append `x` copies of the current array to itself. Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            current_array = array.copy()
            for _ in range(value - 1):
                array.extend(current_array)
        
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    return result
```

With this correction, the program will handle the second type of operation correctly, and the results for the queries will be accurate.

Final: **False**. The given program is incorrect due to the issue with the second type of operation.
