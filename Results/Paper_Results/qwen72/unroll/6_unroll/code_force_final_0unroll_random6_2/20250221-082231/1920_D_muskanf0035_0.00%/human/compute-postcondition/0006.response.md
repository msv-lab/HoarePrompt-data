Output State: **The program returns a list `result` containing the elements from `array` at the indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`.** 

In natural language, this means that for each value `k` in the list `queries`, the program calculates the index `(k - 1) % len(array)` and retrieves the corresponding element from `array`. The `result` list contains these retrieved elements, and the program returns this `result` list.
