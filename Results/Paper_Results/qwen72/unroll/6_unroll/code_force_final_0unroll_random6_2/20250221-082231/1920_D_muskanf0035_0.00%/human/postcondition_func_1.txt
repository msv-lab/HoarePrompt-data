The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `q` from the input, followed by `n` lines of operations and `q` integers representing queries. It then calls another function `func_1` with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments, and prints the results returned by `func_1`. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the results for each test case, and the variables `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` are reinitialized for each test case. The function does not return any value.
