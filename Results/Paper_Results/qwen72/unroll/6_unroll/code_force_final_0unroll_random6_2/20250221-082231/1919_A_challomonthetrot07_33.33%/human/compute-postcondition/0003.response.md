The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. The function is expected to return a result based on these inputs. Since the specific output conditions are not provided, we can only describe the parameters and the general expectation of the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific return conditions are not provided.**
