You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `T` (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) from the input. Based on the values of `a` and `b`, the function prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' according to the following rules: if `a` equals `b`, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` equals 1, it prints 'Alice'; if `b` equals 1, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is odd, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, it prints 'Alice'; if `a` is greater than `b`, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. The values of `a` and `b` are not retained between iterations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have, respectively.

2. **Base Cases:**
   - If `a == b`, the game will end in a draw, but since the problem states that the player who cannot make a valid move loses, and both players will eventually run out of coins at the same time, Bob wins. This is correct.
   - If `a == 1`, Alice will lose on her first move because she cannot remove a coin from her wallet without making it empty. This is correct.
   - If `b == 1`, Bob will lose on his first move because he cannot remove a coin from his wallet without making it empty. This is correct.

3. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - If `a % 2 == 1` (i.e., `a` is odd), Alice will always lose if Bob plays optimally. This is because:
     - Alice can only make an even number of moves (since she starts and each move reduces the number of coins by 1).
     - Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he will always have a coin to remove after Alice's move.
     - This is correct.
   - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1` (i.e., `a` is even and `b` is odd), Alice will win if she plays optimally. This is because:
     - Alice can always force Bob to make the last move, as Bob will eventually run out of coins first.
     - This is correct.
   - If `a > b`, the program assumes Bob wins. This is incorrect. The correct logic should consider the parity of `a` and `b`:
     - If both `a` and `b` are even, the player with more coins will win because they can always force the other player to run out of coins first.
     - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the player with fewer coins will win because the player with more coins will eventually be forced to make the last move.
   - If `a < b`, the program assumes Alice wins. This is incorrect for the same reasons as above.

4. **Correct Logic:**
   - If `a == b`, Bob wins.
   - If `a == 1`, Alice loses.
   - If `b == 1`, Bob loses.
   - If `a % 2 == 1` and `b % 2 == 1`, Bob wins (because the player with fewer coins will win).
   - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, Alice wins.
   - If `a % 2 == 1` and `b % 2 == 0`, Bob wins.
   - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 0`, the player with more coins wins.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle the cases where `a` and `b` are both even or both odd. It incorrectly assumes that the player with more coins always wins when `a > b` or `a < b`, which is not always true. The correct logic should consider the parity of `a` and `b` to determine the winner.
