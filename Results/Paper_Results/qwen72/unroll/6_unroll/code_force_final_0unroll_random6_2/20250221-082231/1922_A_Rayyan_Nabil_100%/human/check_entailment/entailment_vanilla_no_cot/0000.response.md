Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not fully implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if the characters at each position in `a` and `b` are different from the corresponding character in `c`. However, it does not ensure that the characters in `a` and `b` are the same as the lowercase version of the template, and that the characters in `c` are different from the lowercase version of the template.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to ensure that for each position `i`:
1. If the template character at position `i` is lowercase, then `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be equal to this character.
2. If the template character at position `i` is uppercase, then `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of this character.
3. The character `c[i]` must not match the template at position `i`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != b[i]:
            return 'NO'
        if a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i]:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **func_1**:
   - It first checks if `a[i]` is different from `b[i]`. If they are different, it returns 'NO' because they cannot both match the same template.
   - It then checks if `a[i]` or `b[i]` is the same as `c[i]`. If either is the same, it returns 'NO' because `c` should not match the template.
   - If both conditions are satisfied for all positions, it returns 'YES'.

2. **func_2**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, and appends the result of `func_1` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

This corrected program should correctly determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, while `c` does not.
