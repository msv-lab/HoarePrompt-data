The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `t` before the loop starts is already given as 1 <= t <= 1000, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted, as it is not used in the loop head or body.

Since the state of `t` already ensures the loop will execute, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is an empty list.**
