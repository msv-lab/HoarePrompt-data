Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

# Annotated Program:
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a single integer n as input, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, representing the encoded word.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: The loop prints a series of words based on the value of `n` for each iteration. After all iterations, the value of `n` and `word` will be the last values assigned during the final iteration. The `alphabet` string remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer from the user, which specifies the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads another integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78) from the user and prints a decoded word based on the value of `n`. The decoded word is determined by a specific mapping: if `n` is greater than 52, the word is formed by appending the corresponding character from the alphabet (offset by 53) followed by 'zz'; if `n` is between 28 and 52, the word is 'a' followed by the corresponding character (offset by 28) and 'z'; if `n` is 27, the word is 'aay'; otherwise, the word is 'aa' followed by the corresponding character (offset by 3). After all iterations, the function completes, and the `alphabet` string remains unchanged.
