The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` (an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and `y` (an integer such that 1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), followed by a list of `n` integers `a` (each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns a list `results`, where each integer in the list represents the count of pairs in the corresponding test case's array `a` such that the first element of the pair, when negated and taken modulo `x`, and the second element of the pair, when taken modulo `y`, both result in values that have been previously seen in the array. The length of `results` is equal to the number of test cases in `test_cases`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. It returns a list `results` where each element is the count of pairs in the corresponding test case's array `a` such that the negation of the first element modulo `x` and the second element modulo `y` both result in values that have been previously seen in the array. The length of `results` is equal to the number of test cases.**
