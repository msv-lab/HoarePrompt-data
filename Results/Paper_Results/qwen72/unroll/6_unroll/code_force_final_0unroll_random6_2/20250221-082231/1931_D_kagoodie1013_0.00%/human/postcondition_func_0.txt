The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `arr`. It returns a list `results` where each element is the count of pairs `(i, j)` in the corresponding test case's array `arr` such that `i < j`, `-arr[i] % x` and `arr[j] % y` both result in values that have been previously seen in the array. The length of `results` is equal to the number of test cases in `test_cases`.
