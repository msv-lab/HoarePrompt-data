Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, PB and PS are integers such that 1 <= PB <= n and 1 <= PS <= n, p is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, a is a list of positive integers of length n, bodya_score is the result of the function `calculate_score(PB)`, sasha_score is the result of the function `calculate_score(PS)`, and `bodya_score` is greater than or equal to `sasha_score`.**
