Output State: **`start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= `n`, `score` is 0, `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`, `steps` is 0, `visited` is an empty dictionary, `cycle_start` is -1.**

The variable `cycle_start` is assigned the value -1. The values of `start_pos`, `score`, `current_pos`, `steps`, and `visited` remain unchanged.
