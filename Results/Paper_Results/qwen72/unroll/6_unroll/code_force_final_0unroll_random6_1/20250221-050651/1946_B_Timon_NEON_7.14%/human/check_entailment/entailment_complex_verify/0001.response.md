### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of an array `a` after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(number)`**:
   - This function correctly returns the remainder of `number` when divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **Correctness**: This function is correct for the purpose of taking modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Function 2: `func_2(arr)`**:
   - This function attempts to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
   - It initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` to keep track of the current segment and the maximum segment found so far.
   - It iterates through the array, updating `new_segment` and `max_segment` based on whether the current element is positive or negative.
   - After the loop, it appends the final segments to `segments_variants`.
   - It then finds the segment with the maximum sum from `segments_variants`.
   - **Issues**:
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers. In such cases, it should return 0 as the maximum sum (since an empty subarray has a sum of 0).
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array is empty. An empty array should also return 0.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array has a single element. It should return the element itself if it is non-negative, or 0 if it is negative.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array has multiple segments with the same maximum sum. It should return the first segment with the maximum sum.
   - **Correctness**: This function is incorrect due to the issues mentioned.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program is as follows:
     - For each test case, it reads the array `a` and the number of operations `k`.
     - It calls `func_2(a)` to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
     - If the maximum sum is -1 (indicating no valid segment was found), it sets the maximum sum to 0.
     - It computes the final answer as `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **Issues**:
     - The formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` is incorrect. The correct approach should be to find the maximum sum of the array after `k` operations, which involves understanding the impact of inserting the sum of the maximum subarray `k` times.
     - The program does not correctly handle the case where the maximum subarray sum is 0 (i.e., when all elements are negative or the array is empty).
   - **Correctness**: The main logic is incorrect due to the issues mentioned.

5. **Function 3: `func_3(number, quantity)`**:
   - This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operation.
   - It initializes `answer` to 0 but does not provide any logic to compute the final answer.
   - **Correctness**: This function is incorrect as it is incomplete and does not solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because:
- `func_2` does not handle edge cases correctly (all negative numbers, empty array, single element array).
- The main logic for computing the final answer is incorrect.
- `func_3` is incomplete and does not contribute to solving the problem.

Final: **False**
