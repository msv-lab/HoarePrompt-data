Output State: **`new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the segment with the maximum sum found during the iteration, `segments_variants` now includes an additional segment which is `max_segment` with the end index `len(arr) - 1` appended, and `max_sum` remains -1.**

Explanation: The code appends a new segment to `segments_variants`, which is the concatenation of `new_segment` (an empty list) and a list containing the value `len(arr) - 1`. Since `new_segment` is an empty list, the new segment added to `segments_variants` is simply a list containing the value `len(arr) - 1`. The values of `max_segment` and `max_sum` remain unchanged.
