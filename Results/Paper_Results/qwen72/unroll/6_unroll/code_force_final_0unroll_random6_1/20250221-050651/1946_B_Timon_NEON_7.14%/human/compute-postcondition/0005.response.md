Output State: **`new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the segment with the maximum sum found during the iteration, `segments_variants` is a list of segments (each segment is a list containing the sum and the end index of the segment), and `max_sum` remains -1.**

Explanation:
- `new_segment` ends up as an empty list because it is reset to an empty list whenever a negative number is encountered in the array.
- `max_segment` is updated to the segment with the highest sum encountered during the loop. It contains the sum of the segment and the starting index of the segment.
- `segments_variants` contains a list of segments that were considered during the loop. Each segment is represented as a list containing the sum of the segment and the end index of the segment.
- `max_sum` remains unchanged at -1 because it is not modified within the loop.
