### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(number)`**:
   - This function returns the remainder of `number` when divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It is a standard and correct implementation for ensuring the result fits within the required constraints.
   - **Correctness**: This function is correct.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(arr)`**:
   - This function attempts to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
   - However, it has several issues:
     - It does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers. In such cases, the maximum sum should be 0 (an empty subarray), but the function may return an incorrect segment.
     - It does not correctly handle the case where the array is empty. An empty array should return a sum of 0, but the function does not account for this.
     - It does not correctly handle the case where the array has a single element. The function may return an incorrect segment.
     - It does not correctly handle the case where the array has multiple segments with the same maximum sum. The function may return an arbitrary segment.
   - **Correctness**: This function is incorrect due to the issues mentioned.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(number, quantity)`**:
   - This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operation.
   - It initializes `answer` to 0 but does not provide any logic to compute the final answer.
   - **Correctness**: This function is incorrect as it is incomplete and does not solve the problem.

5. **Overall Program**:
   - The program is missing the main logic to solve the problem.
   - The provided functions do not work together to achieve the desired result.
   - The problem requires a more sophisticated approach to find the maximum possible sum after `k` operations, which is not addressed by the current functions.
   - Specifically, the program needs to:
     - Identify the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
     - Use this maximum sum to perform the operations optimally.
     - Ensure the final result is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the problem requirements and lacks the necessary logic to compute the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.

Final: **False**
