The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the segment with the maximum sum found during the iteration. The segment is represented as a list containing the sum of the segment and the start and end indices of the segment within `arr`. If no valid segment is found (i.e., the list is empty or all elements are negative), the function returns `[-1]`.
