### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers.
   - We need to perform exactly `k` operations where in each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - The final answer should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function returns the result of `number % 1000000007`, which is correct for applying the modulo operation.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - However, the logic is flawed:
       - The function initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` as lists, which is not necessary. A simple variable would suffice for the sum.
       - The function incorrectly appends segments to `segments_variants` and updates `max_segment` in a way that does not correctly handle the maximum sum subarray.
       - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array ends with a positive number.
       - The function returns a list with a single element `[-1]` if no valid segment is found, which is not the correct format for the problem.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
     - This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operation.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations, we need to focus on the maximum sum subarray.
   - If the maximum sum subarray is positive, we can repeatedly insert it to maximize the sum.
   - If the maximum sum subarray is non-positive, the best strategy is to insert an empty subarray (sum = 0) to avoid decreasing the sum.
   - The final sum can be computed as:
     - If the maximum sum subarray is positive: `initial_sum + k * max_sum_subarray`
     - If the maximum sum subarray is non-positive: `initial_sum` (since adding 0 `k` times does not change the sum).

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - We need to compute the initial sum of the array.
   - We need to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - We then apply the formula to compute the final sum and take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:
Given the flaws in the provided functions, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
