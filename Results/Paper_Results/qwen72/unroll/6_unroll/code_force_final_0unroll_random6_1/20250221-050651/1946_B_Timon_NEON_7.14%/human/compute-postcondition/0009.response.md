The only objects in the loop head are the variable `segment` and the list `segments_variants`. For the loop to execute, `segments_variants` must contain at least one segment. The state before the loop indicates that `segments_variants` now includes an additional segment, which is `max_segment` with the end index `len(arr) - 1` appended. However, the loop will not execute if `segments_variants` is empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `segments_variants` contains at least one segment.

State: **`new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the segment with the maximum sum found during the iteration, `segments_variants` now includes an additional segment which is `max_segment` with the end index `len(arr) - 1` appended, `max_sum` remains -1, `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`, `segment` is the first segment in `segments_variants`**
