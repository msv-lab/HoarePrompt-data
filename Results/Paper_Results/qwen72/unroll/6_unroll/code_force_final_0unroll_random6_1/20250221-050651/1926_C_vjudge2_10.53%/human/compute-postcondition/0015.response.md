Functionality: **The function `func_1` is intended to accept an integer parameter `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. It should be called in a loop for `t` test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The function returns a value based on the input `n`, but the specific return value is not provided in the problem description.**
