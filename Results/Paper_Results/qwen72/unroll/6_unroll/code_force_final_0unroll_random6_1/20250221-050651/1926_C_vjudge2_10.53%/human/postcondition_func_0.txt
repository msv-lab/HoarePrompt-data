The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases, and then reads `t` integers `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) from the user. It calculates and stores the cumulative sums of a specific sequence of values for each integer `n` in a list `sum_values`. Finally, it prints the cumulative sum for each `n` in the `numbers` list. The function does not return any value.
