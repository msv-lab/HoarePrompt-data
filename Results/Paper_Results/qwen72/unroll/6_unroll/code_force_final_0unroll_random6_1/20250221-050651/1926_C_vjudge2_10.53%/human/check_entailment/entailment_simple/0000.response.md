Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` should be defined with an input parameter `n` to match the problem description. However, the function is defined without any parameters, which is incorrect.
   - The function should handle multiple test cases, so it should be called in a loop with the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) provided. This is correctly implemented in the function.

2. **Initialization of Lists**:
   - The `numbers` list is correctly initialized to store the input values for each test case.
   - The `values` and `sum_values` lists are initialized to store the sum of digits and the cumulative sum of these values, respectively. This is a good approach to avoid recalculating the sum of digits for each number.

3. **Sum of Digits Calculation**:
   - The initial values for `values` and `sum_values` for numbers from 0 to 9 are correctly set.
   - The loop from 10 to `n` correctly calculates the sum of digits for each number and updates the `values` and `sum_values` lists. However, the loop should iterate up to `max(numbers)` instead of `n` because `n` is the last input number, not the maximum number in the `numbers` list.

4. **Output**:
   - The final loop correctly prints the cumulative sum for each `n` in the `numbers` list.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient in terms of time complexity, as it precomputes the sum of digits and cumulative sums in a single pass, which is necessary to meet the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

6. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic to calculate the sum of digits and the cumulative sum is correct. However, the loop should iterate up to `max(numbers)` to ensure all required values are computed.

Given the above points, the program has a logical error in the loop range and a functional error in the function definition. These issues need to be fixed for the program to be correct.

Correctness: **False**
