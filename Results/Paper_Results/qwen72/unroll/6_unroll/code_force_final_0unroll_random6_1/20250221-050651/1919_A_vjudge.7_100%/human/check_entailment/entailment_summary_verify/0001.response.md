### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet.
   - After deciding whether to swap, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the game is symmetric and the total number of coins (a + b) plays a crucial role.
   - If the total number of coins is even, the game will end in a way where both players have an equal number of moves. Since Alice starts, Bob will always have the last move and win.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will have one more move than Bob. Therefore, Alice can always ensure that she has the last move and win.

3. **Bitwise Operation:**
   - The program uses the bitwise AND operation `a + b & 1` to check if the total number of coins is odd or even.
   - However, the correct way to check if a number is even or odd using bitwise operations is to use the expression `(a + b) & 1`. The parentheses are crucial to ensure the correct order of operations.
   - Without the parentheses, the expression `a + b & 1` is evaluated as `a + (b & 1)`, which is incorrect because the bitwise AND operation has higher precedence than addition.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b`.
   - It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using the bitwise AND operation.
   - Based on the result, it prints "Bob" if the sum is even and "Alice" if the sum is odd.

5. **Corrected Code:**
   - The correct implementation should use the expression `(a + b) & 1` to check the parity of the total number of coins.
   - Here is the corrected version of the function:
     ```python
     def func():
         test = int(input())
         for t in range(test):
             (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
             if (a + b) & 1 == 0:
                 print('Bob')
             else:
                 print('Alice')
     ```

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where both `a` and `b` are 1 correctly. In this case, the sum is 2 (even), and Bob wins.
   - The program also handles cases where the number of coins is large (up to \(10^9\)) correctly, as the bitwise operation is efficient and works within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The original program has a syntax error in the bitwise operation that affects the correctness of the parity check. The corrected version of the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all test cases.

### Correctness:
**False** (due to the syntax error in the bitwise operation, the original program is incorrect)

Final: **False**
