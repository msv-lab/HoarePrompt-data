You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t, a list of integers n, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of arrows. t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and each string in the tuple consists of exactly n characters '<' and/or '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of all n values does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: The loop iterates t times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer n, and two strings of arrows a and b, each of length n. After processing, it prints 'No' if the second-to-last character in b is '<', otherwise it prints 'Yes'. The values of t, n, a, and b are not retained after each iteration, so the final state of these variables is undefined.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of even integers `n` representing the lengths of arrow strings, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of arrows. It returns a list of results, each indicating whether it is possible to align the arrows in the first row with those in the second row by rotating some arrows, with "Yes" for possible and "No" for not possible.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
