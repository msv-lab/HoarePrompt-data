Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw. It only checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (i.e., `b[n - 2]`) is pointing to the left (`<`). If it is, the program immediately concludes that the robot cannot reach the target cell `(2, n)`. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine the robot's ability to reach the target cell. The robot's movement is influenced by both rows, and it can potentially reach the target cell even if `b[n - 2]` is `<`, depending on the configuration of the arrows in the grid.

To correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`, a more comprehensive approach is needed. The robot must be able to navigate through the grid, moving left, right, or down, and then following the arrows. The correct solution would involve simulating the robot's movement through the grid to check if it can reach the target cell.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_reach_target(n, a, b):
    # Initialize the robot's position
    row, col = 1, 1
    
    # Simulate the robot's movement
    while col < n:
        if row == 1:
            if a[col] == '<':
                col -= 1
            else:
                col += 1
            if col == 0:
                break
            row = 2 if b[col - 1] == '>' else 1
        else:  # row == 2
            if b[col] == '<':
                col -= 1
            else:
                col += 1
            if col == 0:
                break
            row = 1 if a[col - 1] == '>' else 2
    
    # Check if the robot has reached the target cell
    return row == 2 and col == n

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        if can_reach_target(n, a, b):
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version simulates the robot's movement and checks if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`. It handles the robot's movement based on the arrows in both rows and ensures that the robot does not move outside the grid.
