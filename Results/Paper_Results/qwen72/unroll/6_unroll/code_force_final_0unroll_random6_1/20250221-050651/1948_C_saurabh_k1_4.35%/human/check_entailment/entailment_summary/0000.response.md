Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) by following the rules of movement. The key insight is that the robot must be able to move to the last column (n) in the second row (2) to reach the target cell. The robot's movement is influenced by the arrows in the grid, and it must be able to navigate through the grid without getting stuck.

The provided program checks if the second-to-last character in the second row (`b[n - 2]`) is '<'. If it is, the program prints 'No', indicating that the robot cannot reach the target cell. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. This check is based on the idea that if the second-to-last cell in the second row points left, the robot cannot move to the last cell in the second row, because it would be forced to move left and then get stuck.

However, this check is not sufficient to determine the correctness of the program. The robot can potentially move in a more complex pattern, and the second-to-last cell in the second row is not the only factor that determines whether the robot can reach the target cell. The robot can move between rows and columns multiple times, and the arrows in the first row (`a`) can also influence the robot's path.

To properly determine if the robot can reach the target cell, we need to consider the following:
1. The robot must be able to move to the second row at some point.
2. Once in the second row, the robot must be able to move to the last column (n) without getting stuck.

The program's logic is flawed because it only checks the second-to-last cell in the second row, which is not enough to ensure the robot can reach the target cell. For example, if the first row has a pattern that prevents the robot from moving to the second row, the robot will never reach the target cell, regardless of the second-to-last cell in the second row.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
