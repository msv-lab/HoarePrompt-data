Output State: **The function will print the result of `x + y - z` for each test case, where `x` is the number of occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`, and `z` is the number of occurrences of the substring 'mapie' in the string `s`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are calculated for each test case independently. The initial state of the function parameters `t` and the list of tuples remains unchanged.**
