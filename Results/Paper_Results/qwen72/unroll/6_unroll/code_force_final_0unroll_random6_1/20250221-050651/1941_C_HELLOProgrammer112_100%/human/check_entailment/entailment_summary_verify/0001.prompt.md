You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        z = s.count('mapie')
        print(x + y - z)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads input from the user for a specified number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It then calculates the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' within `s`, and prints the result of `x + y - z`, where `x` is the count of 'map', `y` is the count of 'pie', and `z` is the count of 'mapie'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The initial state of the function parameters is not preserved as the function does not accept any parameters directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of characters to delete from a string `s` to ensure it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a string length `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
   - It then counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in `s`.
   - It also counts the occurrences of the substring "mapie" in `s`.
   - Finally, it prints the result of `x + y - z`, where `x` is the count of "map", `y` is the count of "pie", and `z` is the count of "mapie".

3. **Identifying the Flaw:**
   - The logic of the program is flawed because it only counts the exact occurrences of "map" and "pie" and "mapie".
   - However, the problem requires removing the minimum number of characters to ensure that neither "pie" nor "map" appears as a substring, even if they overlap or are part of a larger string.
   - The program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "mappie", the program will count "map" and "pie" separately, but removing one character can make both disappear.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify all positions where "pie" or "map" can occur and then determine the minimum number of deletions required to remove these substrings.
   - A more appropriate approach would be to use a sliding window or a state machine to track the presence of "pie" and "map" and calculate the minimum deletions.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not handle overlapping substrings and does not ensure the minimum deletions.
