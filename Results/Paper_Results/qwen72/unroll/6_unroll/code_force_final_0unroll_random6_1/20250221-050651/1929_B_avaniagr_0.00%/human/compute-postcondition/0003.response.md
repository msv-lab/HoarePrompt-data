Functionality: ** The function reads lines from the standard input, excluding the first line, and for each line, it splits the line into two integers `n` and `k`. It then calculates and prints the result of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` for each pair of `n` and `k`. After the function completes, the values of `n` and `k` will be the last pair of integers read from the input. The function does not return any value. **
