#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_cells_to_color(n, k):` where `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: The loop reads each line from the input (excluding the first line), splits the line into two integers `n` and `k`, and prints the result of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` for each pair of `n` and `k`. After the loop finishes, the values of `n` and `k` will be the last pair of integers read from the input, and the function definition remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads lines from the standard input, excluding the first line, and for each line, it splits the line into two integers `n` and `k`. It then calculates and prints the result of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` for each pair of `n` and `k`. After the function completes, the values of `n` and `k` will be the last pair of integers read from the input. The function does not return any value.
