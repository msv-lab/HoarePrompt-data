Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input from stdin, skipping the first line which contains the number of test cases. It then processes each subsequent line, which contains the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `(k // 2 + k % 2)` calculates the minimum number of cells needed to cover `k` diagonals when `k` is less than `4n - 3`.
   - The term `(k < 4 * n - 3)` ensures that the above calculation is used only when `k` is less than `4n - 3`.
   - The term `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)` ensures that if `k` is greater than or equal to `4n - 3`, the program outputs `2n`, which is the number of cells needed to cover all diagonals.
   - The term `(k == 4 * n - 2)` adds an additional cell if `k` is exactly `4n - 2`, which is the maximum number of diagonals.

3. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case.

Let's verify the logic with the provided test cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `k = 4`
  - `k < 4 * n - 3` is `4 < 9`, which is true.
  - `(k // 2 + k % 2) = (4 // 2 + 4 % 2) = 2 + 0 = 2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `k = 3`
  - `k < 4 * n - 3` is `3 < 9`, which is true.
  - `(k // 2 + k % 2) = (3 // 2 + 3 % 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `k = 10`
  - `k >= 4 * n - 3` is `10 >= 9`, which is true.
  - `2 * n = 2 * 3 = 6`
  - Output: `6`

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 3`, `k = 9`
  - `k >= 4 * n - 3` is `9 >= 9`, which is true.
  - `2 * n = 2 * 3 = 6`
  - Output: `6`

- **Test Case 5**: `n = 4`, `k = 7`
  - `k < 4 * n - 3` is `7 < 13`, which is true.
  - `(k // 2 + k % 2) = (7 // 2 + 7 % 2) = 3 + 1 = 4`
  - Output: `4`

- **Test Case 6**: `n = 7`, `k = 11`
  - `k < 4 * n - 3` is `11 < 25`, which is true.
  - `(k // 2 + k % 2) = (11 // 2 + 11 % 2) = 5 + 1 = 6`
  - Output: `6`

- **Test Case 7**: `n = 2`, `k = 3`
  - `k < 4 * n - 3` is `3 < 5`, which is true.
  - `(k // 2 + k % 2) = (3 // 2 + 3 % 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - Output: `2`

The program correctly handles all the test cases and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
