You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is the length of the array and k is the number of sorted cyclic shifts required. Both n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        
        print(*res)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read `n` and `k` from the input. If `k` equals `n`, it will print an array of `n` ones. If `k` equals 1, it will print the range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, it will print `-1`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `t` will retain their final values after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the length of an array and `k` is the number of sorted cyclic shifts required. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function returns the array after performing `k` sorted cyclic shifts on it.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
