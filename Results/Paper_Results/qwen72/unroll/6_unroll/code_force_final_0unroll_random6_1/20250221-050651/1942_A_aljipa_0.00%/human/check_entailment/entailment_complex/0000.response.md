Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case individually. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, which are the length of the array and the number of sorted cyclic shifts required, respectively.

2. **Case Handling**:
   - **Case 1: `k == n`**: If `k` equals `n`, the function creates an array of `n` ones. This is correct because an array of identical elements (like `[1, 1, ..., 1]`) will have all its cyclic shifts sorted. This satisfies the condition that exactly `k` (which is `n`) cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - **Case 2: `k == 1`**: If `k` equals 1, the function creates an array using `range(n)`, which generates a sequence of integers from 0 to `n-1`. This is correct because the only sorted cyclic shift of this array is the array itself, and all other cyclic shifts will be unsorted. This satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift is sorted.
   - **Case 3: `k != 1 and k != n`**: If `k` is neither 1 nor `n`, the function prints `-1`. This is correct because there is no simple way to construct an array that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts for any `k` other than 1 or `n`. The problem constraints and the nature of cyclic shifts make it impossible to have exactly `k` sorted shifts for any other value of `k`.

3. **Output**: The function prints the results for each test case as required. It prints the array of `n` ones, the range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, or `-1` depending on the values of `n` and `k`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly. For example, if `n` is 1, the array will always be sorted, and the function will print `[1]` for `k == 1` and `k == n` (since `n == 1`).

5. **Constraints**: The function adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description. It ensures that the elements of the array are within the range `[1, 10^9]` for the case where `k == n` (since all elements are 1), and for the case where `k == 1`, the elements are within the range `[0, n-1]`.

Given this reasoning, the function appears to be correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
