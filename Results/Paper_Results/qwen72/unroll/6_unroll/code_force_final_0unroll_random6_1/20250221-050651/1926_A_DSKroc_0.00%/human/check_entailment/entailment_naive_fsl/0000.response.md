Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the output for each test case. The `if ac > bc:` and `else:` blocks should be indented to be inside the for loop that iterates over the test cases. As it stands, the program will only print the result for the last test case, and not for all test cases as required by the problem description. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
```

This corrected version will print the result for each test case, as specified in the problem description.
