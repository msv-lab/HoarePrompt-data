Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive, and the function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where each of the following `t` lines contains a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All `t` strings are distinct. The function should output the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each string to stdout.**
