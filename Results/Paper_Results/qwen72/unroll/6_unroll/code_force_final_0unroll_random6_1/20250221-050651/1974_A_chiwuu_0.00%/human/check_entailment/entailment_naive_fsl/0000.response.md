Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 2x2 icons is such that they do not completely fill a screen, and the remaining space is insufficient for the 1x1 icons. For example, consider the input `1 1` (1 1x1 icon and 1 2x2 icon). The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons correctly, but it does not correctly account for the remaining space on the screen when placing 1x1 icons. Specifically, the program calculates `t1` as the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons, but it does not consider that the 2x2 icons might leave enough space on the same screen for some 1x1 icons. This can lead to an incorrect result.

For the input `1 1`, the program will output `2`, but the correct output should be `1` because the 1x1 icon can fit in the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icon on the same screen.
