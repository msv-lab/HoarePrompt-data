You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

    #State: The loop prints the value of `t` for each iteration, where `t` is calculated based on the input values `a` and `b` provided during each iteration. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 2x2 icons is such that they do not completely fill a screen, and the remaining space is insufficient for the 1x1 icons. For example, consider the input `1 1` (1 1x1 icon and 1 2x2 icon). The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons correctly, but it does not correctly account for the remaining space on the screen when placing 1x1 icons. Specifically, the program calculates `t1` as the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons, but it does not consider that the 2x2 icons might leave enough space on the same screen for some 1x1 icons. This can lead to an incorrect result.

For the input `1 1`, the program will output `2`, but the correct output should be `1` because the 1x1 icon can fit in the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icon on the same screen.
