The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. This ensures that `arr` has at least one element. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `arr` during the first iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `arr` has at least one element and `i` is the first element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `i` is the first element of `arr`**
