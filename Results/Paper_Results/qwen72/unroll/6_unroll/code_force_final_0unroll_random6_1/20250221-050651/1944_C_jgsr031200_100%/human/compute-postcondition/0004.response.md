Output State: **`freq` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `arr`. The length of `freq` remains `n + 1`. `cou` is 0.** 

The initial state of `freq` and its relationship to `arr` and `n` remain unchanged. The variable `cou` is now initialized to 0.
