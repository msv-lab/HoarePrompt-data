Reasoning:
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not simulate the game logic as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` indeed does not account for the strategic choices of Alice and Bob. Instead, it calculates the MEX of the array `arr` based on the frequency of elements, which is a different approach and does not reflect the game's rules.

Let's break down the function `func_1` to understand why it fails to meet the problem requirements:

1. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` creates a frequency list `freq` where `freq[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `arr`.
   - This part is correct and accurately counts the occurrences of each integer.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The function then iterates through the range `0` to `n` and uses a counter `cou` to track the number of unique elements that appear exactly once in `arr`.
   - If `cou` reaches 2 or if an element `i` has a frequency of 0, the function prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `arr` and appending them to `c` (for Alice) or removing them (for Bob).

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The problem requires simulating the game where Alice and Bob play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of `c`, respectively.
   - The provided function does not simulate the turns or the strategic choices of the players. It simply looks for the first integer that either appears exactly once and is the second such integer encountered, or the first integer that does not appear at all.

4. **Example Case**:
   - For the input `1 4 0 1 2 3`, the expected output is `1` because Alice and Bob can play optimally to ensure that the MEX of `c` is 1.
   - However, the provided function prints `4` because it does not simulate the game and instead calculates the MEX based on the frequency of elements.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic and thus does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **False**
