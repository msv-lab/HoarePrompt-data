The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers, where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. It calculates the frequency of each integer in `arr` and then prints the first integer `i` that either has a frequency of 1 and is the second such integer encountered, or the first integer `i` that has a frequency of 0. The function does not return any value, and the list `arr` remains unchanged.
