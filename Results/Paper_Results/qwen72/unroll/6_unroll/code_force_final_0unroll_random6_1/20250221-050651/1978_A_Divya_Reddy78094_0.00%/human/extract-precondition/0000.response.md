Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the number of pages in each book, and an integer `n` representing the number of books, where 2 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all 1 <= i <= n.** 

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def func(a, n):
```

This function will then process the list `a` of book pages and the integer `n` to find the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles.
