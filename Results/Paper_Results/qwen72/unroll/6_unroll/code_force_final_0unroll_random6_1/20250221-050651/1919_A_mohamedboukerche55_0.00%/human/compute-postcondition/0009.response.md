Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from the input, splits it into two integers `a` and `b`, and then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, it prints "bob". If the sum is odd, it prints "alice". After processing all test cases, the final values of `a` and `b` will be the values from the last test case, and the variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1`. **
