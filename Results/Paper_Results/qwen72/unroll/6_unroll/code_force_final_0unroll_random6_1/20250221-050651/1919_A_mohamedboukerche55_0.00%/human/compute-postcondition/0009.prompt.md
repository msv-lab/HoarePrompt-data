You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters, which is a discrepancy.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the integer input initially provided. For each iteration, the input string `s` was split into two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. After all iterations, the final values of `a` and `b` will be the values from the last test case. The variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1`.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: *The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the integer input initially provided. For each iteration, the input string `s` was split into two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. After all iterations, the final values of `a` and `b` will be the values from the last test case. The variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1`. Additionally, if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0` holds. If the sum of `a` and `b` is not even, the condition `(a + b) % 2 != 0` holds.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, each with two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function should accept the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, the integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the values of `a` and `b`. However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters, which is a discrepancy.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
