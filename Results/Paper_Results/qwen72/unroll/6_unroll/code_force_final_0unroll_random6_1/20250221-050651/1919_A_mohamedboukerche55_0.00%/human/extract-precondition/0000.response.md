Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters, which is a discrepancy.**

Given the discrepancy noted, the correct function definition should be:
```
def func(t, cases):
```
Where `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `a` and `b`.
