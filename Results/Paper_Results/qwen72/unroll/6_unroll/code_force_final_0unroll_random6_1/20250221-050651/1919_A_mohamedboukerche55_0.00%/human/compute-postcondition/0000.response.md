The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment with each iteration of the loop.

Since the function `func` and its parameters `a` and `b` are not part of the loop head, they cannot be adjusted here. However, the state of `t` must be such that it is an integer and 1 <= t <= 1000 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000**
