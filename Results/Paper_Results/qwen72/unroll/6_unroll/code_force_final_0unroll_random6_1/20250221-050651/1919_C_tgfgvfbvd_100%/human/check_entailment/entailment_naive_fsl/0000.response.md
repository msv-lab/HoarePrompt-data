Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for updating `a` and `b` and counting the penalty `c` is flawed. The program should be designed to minimize the penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences such that the number of increasing pairs in each subsequence is minimized.

Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
4
```

The program incorrectly counts the penalty as 4, while the correct minimum penalty for this input is 3. This is because the program does not correctly handle the logic for splitting the array and counting the penalty. The logic for updating `a` and `b` and incrementing `c` does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences.
