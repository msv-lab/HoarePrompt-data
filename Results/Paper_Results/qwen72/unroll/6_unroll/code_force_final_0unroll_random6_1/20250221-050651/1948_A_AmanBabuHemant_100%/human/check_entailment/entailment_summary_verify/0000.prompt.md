You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in the string. The function prints 'NO' if `n` is odd or if the length of the generated string exceeds 200 characters. If `n` is even and the length of the string is within the limit, it prints 'YES' followed by the string, which consists of the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. After all test cases are processed, the function concludes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is 1, the program should print "NO" because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string where a special character is defined as a character equal to exactly one of its neighbors. However, the program incorrectly prints "NO" for any odd `n`, including 1, which is not the correct behavior for `n = 1`.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
6
1
2
```
The program will output:
```
YES
AAABAACC
NO
YES
MM
```
The output for `n = 1` should be "NO", but the program's logic for handling odd `n` values is flawed, as it does not consider the specific case of `n = 1` separately. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
