Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the integer `n` for each case.

2. **Odd `n` Check**: The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because each special character must form a pair with its neighbor, and an odd number of such pairs is not possible.

3. **String Construction**: If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each 'A' is a special character because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors (the other 'A' in the 'AAB' pattern). The 'B' in the pattern is not a special character because it is not equal to either of its neighbors.

4. **String Length Check**: The program checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. This is correct because the problem guarantees that if a solution exists, there is a solution of length at most 200. The length of `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always less than or equal to 150 for `1 <= n <= 50`.

5. **Edge Case Handling**: The program handles the edge case where `n` is odd by printing 'NO'. It also ensures that the constructed string is within the length limit of 200.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly handles all the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
