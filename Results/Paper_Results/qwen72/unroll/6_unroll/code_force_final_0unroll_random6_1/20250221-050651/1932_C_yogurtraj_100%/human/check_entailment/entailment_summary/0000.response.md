### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `l` is correctly initialized to the count of 'L' commands in the string `s`.
   - The variables `k`, `q1`, and `q2` are initialized based on the last command in the string `s`.

3. **Initial Product Calculation**:
   - The initial value of `k` is set to the last element of the array `a` modulo `m` if the last command is 'R', or to the element at index `l-1` modulo `m` if the last command is 'L'. This is incorrect because the initial product should be the product of all elements in the array `a` modulo `m`.

4. **Processing Commands**:
   - The function iterates from `n-2` to `0` (i.e., from the second-to-last command to the first command).
   - For each command, it updates the product `k` by multiplying it with the appropriate element from the array `a` and taking the result modulo `m`.
   - The indices `q1` and `q2` are used to track the current positions in the array `a` for 'L' and 'R' commands, respectively.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the list `y` for each test case, which contains the remainders of the product of the array elements at each step.

### Issues:
- **Initial Product Calculation**: The initial value of `k` should be the product of all elements in the array `a` modulo `m`, not just a single element.
- **Index Handling**: The indices `q1` and `q2` are not correctly initialized and updated. They should be initialized to the start and end of the array, respectively, and updated as elements are removed.

### Correctness:
- **False**: The program does not correctly compute the initial product of the array elements modulo `m`, and the indices used to track the array elements are not correctly managed.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = input()
        
        # Calculate the initial product of all elements modulo m
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        # Initialize the result list
        y = [0] * n
        y[0] = product
        
        # Initialize the left and right pointers
        left = 0
        right = n - 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if s[i-1] == 'L':
                # Remove the leftmost element
                product = (product * pow(a[left], m-2, m)) % m
                left += 1
            else:
                # Remove the rightmost element
                product = (product * pow(a[right], m-2, m)) % m
                right -= 1
            y[i] = product
        
        print(*y)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initial Product Calculation**: The initial product of all elements in the array `a` is calculated and taken modulo `m`.
- **Modular Inverse**: When an element is removed from the array, the product is updated by multiplying it with the modular inverse of the removed element. The modular inverse is calculated using `pow(a[i], m-2, m)` based on Fermat's Little Theorem.
- **Index Management**: The left and right pointers are correctly initialized and updated as elements are removed from the array.

### Final Correctness:
- **False**: The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned. The corrected program should be used instead.
