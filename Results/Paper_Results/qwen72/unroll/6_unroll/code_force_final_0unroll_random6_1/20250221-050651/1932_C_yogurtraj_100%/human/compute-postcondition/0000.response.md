The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ii` and the input from `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the function should be called with the appropriate input, which means the input must be provided and must be a positive integer.

State: **`ii` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
