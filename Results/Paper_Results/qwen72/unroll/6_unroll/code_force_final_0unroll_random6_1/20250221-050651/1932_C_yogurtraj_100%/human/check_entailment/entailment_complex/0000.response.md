### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the list `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The function counts the number of 'L' commands in the string `s` and stores it in `l`.
   - It initializes `k` to the value of the element that will be processed last based on the last command in `s`. If the last command is 'L', it sets `k` to `a[l - 1] % m`. If the last command is 'R', it sets `k` to `a[l] % m`.
   - It initializes `q1` and `q2` to track the indices of the elements to be processed.

3. **Output List Initialization**:
   - The function initializes a list `y` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.

4. **Final Value Assignment**:
   - The function assigns the last computed value of `k` to the last element of `y`.

5. **Processing Commands**:
   - The function iterates from `n - 2` to `0` (i.e., from the second-to-last command to the first command).
   - For each command, it updates `k` by multiplying it with the appropriate element from `a` and taking the result modulo `m`.
   - It then updates the indices `q1` and `q2` based on the command.
   - The computed value of `k` is stored in the corresponding position in `y`.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the list `y` for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Indexing and Off-by-One Errors**:
  - The logic for setting `k` and the indices `q1` and `q2` is incorrect. Specifically, the initial values of `q1` and `q2` are not correctly set to track the elements that will be removed.
  - The logic for updating `q1` and `q2` is also flawed. For example, if the last command is 'L', `q1` should be set to `l - 1` and `q2` to `l`, but the function sets `q1` to `l - 2` and `q2` to `l`.

- **Correct Logic**:
  - The correct approach should be to maintain a product of the elements in `a` and update it as elements are removed based on the commands.
  - The indices `q1` and `q2` should be used to track the current left and right boundaries of the array, respectively.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = input()
        
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        y = [0] * n
        
        left = 0
        right = n - 1
        
        for i in range(n):
            y[i] = product
            if s[i] == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(a[left], m - 2, m)) % m
                left += 1
            else:
                product = (product * pow(a[right], m - 2, m)) % m
                right -= 1
        
        print(*y)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- **Product Initialization**:
  - The product of all elements in `a` is computed and taken modulo `m` to initialize `product`.

- **Processing Commands**:
  - For each command, the current product is stored in `y`.
  - If the command is 'L', the product is updated by dividing it by the leftmost element (using modular inverse).
  - If the command is 'R', the product is updated by dividing it by the rightmost element (using modular inverse).
  - The indices `left` and `right` are updated to reflect the removal of the element.

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical errors in the way it handles the indices and updates the product. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
