The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it is designed to read input from standard input or a file. The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers `n` and `m`, a list of `n` integers `a`, and a string `s` of `n` characters, where each character is either 'L' or 'R'. The constraints for the input are as follows: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (number of test cases), 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 (length of list `a` and string `s`), 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input values. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the problem statement.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input or a file, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, a list of `n` integers `a`, and a string `s` of `n` characters ('L' or 'R'). It processes each test case and returns a result based on the input values, adhering to the given constraints.**
