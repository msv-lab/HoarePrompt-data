Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded to a given integer `n`. The encoding is based on the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet. The program uses a series of conditional statements to construct the word based on the value of `n`.

1. **Case 1: `n > 52`**  
   - If `n` is greater than 52, the word is constructed as the character at position `n - 53` followed by 'zz'.
   - This is correct because the maximum sum for a word with the first letter being 'a' and the last two letters being 'z' is 26 + 26 + 1 = 53. Therefore, for `n > 52`, the first letter must be greater than 'a' to achieve the required sum, and 'zz' is the lexicographically smallest combination for the last two letters.

2. **Case 2: `28 ≤ n ≤ 52`**  
   - If `n` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), the word is constructed as 'a' followed by the character at position `n - 28` and then 'z'.
   - This is correct because the maximum sum for a word with the first letter being 'a' and the last letter being 'z' is 26 + 1 + 1 = 28. For `n` in this range, the second letter must be greater than 'a' to achieve the required sum, and 'z' is the lexicographically smallest combination for the last letter.

3. **Case 3: `n == 27`**  
   - If `n` is 27, the word is 'aay'.
   - This is correct because the sum 27 can only be achieved with 'a' (1) + 'a' (1) + 'y' (25).

4. **Case 4: `3 ≤ n ≤ 26`**  
   - If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), the word is constructed as 'aa' followed by the character at position `n - 3`.
   - This is correct because the sum 3 can only be achieved with 'a' (1) + 'a' (1) + 'a' (1), and for any sum between 3 and 26, the first two letters are 'a' and the third letter is the character at position `n - 3`.

The program correctly handles all the specified cases and constructs the lexicographically smallest word for each `n` within the given range.

Correctness: **True**
