Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly initialized, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree, `stack` is a list containing a single tuple `(s, False)`.** 

The initial state is preserved, and the `stack` variable is now initialized as a list with a single tuple `(s, False)`.
