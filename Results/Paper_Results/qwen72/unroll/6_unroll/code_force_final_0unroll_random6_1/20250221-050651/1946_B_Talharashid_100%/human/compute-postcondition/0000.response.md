The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the default behavior of the `range` function in Python.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is 0, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
