### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers and need to perform `k` operations.
   - In each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray and insert its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations and output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.
   - The maximum sum of a contiguous subarray can be found using Kadane's algorithm, which is used to find the maximum subarray sum in linear time.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses a variable `c` to keep track of the current sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - It also uses a variable `maxi` to keep track of the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found so far.
   - For each element in the array:
     - If the element is negative and the current sum `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of the element, it resets `c` to 0.
     - Otherwise, it adds the element to `c` and updates `maxi` if `c` is greater than `maxi`.
   - After processing the array, it calculates the final result using the formula \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

4. **Formula Analysis:**
   - The formula \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l))\) is derived from the idea that the maximum subarray sum can be added `2^k - 1` times to the original sum of the array.
   - This is because each operation can potentially double the number of times the maximum subarray sum is added to the array.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the array contains only negative numbers, the maximum subarray sum will be 0 (an empty subarray).
   - If the array contains positive numbers, the maximum subarray sum will be the sum of the largest contiguous subarray.
   - The program correctly handles these edge cases by resetting `c` to 0 when a negative number is encountered and the current sum is not positive.

6. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure it fits within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations. It uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum and applies the correct formula to calculate the final result. The program also handles edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
