Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3 2
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
12
```

**Actual Output:**
```
11
```

**Explanation of the Test Case:**
- The array is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- The sum of the entire array is `6`.
- After the first operation, if we insert the sum of the entire array at the end, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 6]`.
- The sum of the new array is `12`.
- After the second operation, if we insert the sum of the entire new array at the end, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 6, 12]`.
- The sum of the final array is `24`, but since we need the result modulo `10^9 + 7`, the output should be `24 % 1000000007 = 24`.

However, the program calculates the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and uses it in the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`. This approach does not correctly account for the possibility of inserting the sum of the entire array multiple times, which can lead to incorrect results.

In this specific case, the program calculates:
- `maxi` as `6` (the sum of the entire array).
- The formula `(2 ** 2 * 6 - 6 + 6) % 1000000007` results in `11`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the optimal strategy is to repeatedly insert the sum of the entire array.
