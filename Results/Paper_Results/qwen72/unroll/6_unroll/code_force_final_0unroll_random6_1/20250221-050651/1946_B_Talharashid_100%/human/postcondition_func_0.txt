The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where in each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an integer `k`, followed by a list `l` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence of `l` that is non-negative, and then computes a value using this maximum sum and `k`. The final result for each test case is printed, which is the value `(2
