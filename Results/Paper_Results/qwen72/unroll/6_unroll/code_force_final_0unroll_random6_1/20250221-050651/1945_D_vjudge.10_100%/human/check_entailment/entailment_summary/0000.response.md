Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue. The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating this minimum cost. Let's break down the logic and see if it correctly addresses the problem:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')`, which represents an infinitely large number. This will be used to track the minimum cost.
   - `x` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total cost of bribes from the last person to the first person in the queue.

2. **Loop through the queue in reverse**:
   - The loop iterates from the last person in the queue (`n-1`) to the first person (`0`).
   - For each person at position `i`:
     - If `i` is less than `m`, it means Kirill can potentially move to this position. The cost to move to this position is calculated as `x + a[i]`, and `pergunta` is updated to the minimum of its current value and this new cost.
     - `x` is incremented by the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This step ensures that `x` accumulates the minimum cost of bribes for each position `i` to the end of the queue.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the function prints `pergunta`, which should be the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position no greater than `m`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **Incorrect Update of `pergunta`**:
  - The update `pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])` is inside the loop, but it should only consider the cost of moving to a position `i` that is less than `m`. The current logic updates `pergunta` for all positions, which is incorrect.

- **Accumulation of `x`**:
  - The accumulation `x += min(a[i], b[i])` is correct in the sense that it adds the minimum cost of bribing the person at position `i` or the people between `i` and the next position. However, this logic should be reconsidered to ensure it correctly reflects the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position `j` where `j < i`.

- **Function Call**:
  - The function `func_1` is called with `pergunta` as an argument, but `pergunta` is not used within the function. This is unnecessary and can be removed.

To correct the program, we need to ensure that the cost calculation and updates are done correctly. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
numCasos = int(input())
for i in range(numCasos):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(a, b, n, m)

def func_1(a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    pergunta = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        x += b[i]
    print(pergunta)
```

In the corrected version:
- `x` is incremented by `b[i]` instead of `min(a[i], b[i])` because `b[i]` represents the cost of bribing the people between positions `i` and `i-1`.
- The update `pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])` is only done when `i < m`.

Correctness: **False**

The original program has logical errors in the cost calculation and updates, which need to be corrected as shown above.
