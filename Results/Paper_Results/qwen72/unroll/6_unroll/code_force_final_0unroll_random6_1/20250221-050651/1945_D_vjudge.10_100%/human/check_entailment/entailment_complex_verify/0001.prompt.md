You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Annotated Code:

    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), a is a list of n integers where each a_i represents the cost to bribe the i-th person in the queue (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), b is a list of n integers where each b_i represents the cost to bribe each person between the i-th and the person Kirill is currently bribing (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9), n is an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and m is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: pergunta is the minimum cost to bribe people to reach a position up to m, x is the total cost of the minimum bribes from the last person to the first person in the queue.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum cost to bribe people to reach a position up to m)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `pergunta`, a list of integers `a`, a list of integers `b`, an integer `n`, and an integer `m`. It calculates and prints the minimum total cost required for Kirill to bribe people in the queue to reach a position no greater than `m`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `pergunta` is updated to the minimum cost to bribe people to reach a position up to `m`, and `x` is the total cost of the minimum bribes from the last person to the first person in the queue.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `numCasos`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')`, which is a good choice to ensure that any valid cost will be less than this initial value.

3. **Loop Through the Queue:**
   - The program iterates through the queue from the last person to the first person using a for loop with `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`.
   - This loop is designed to simulate Kirill moving forward in the queue by bribing people.

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - For each person `i` in the queue:
     - If `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of the current `pergunta` and the cost of moving to position `i` (which is `x + a[i]`).
     - It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`. This step is crucial because it accounts for the cost of bribing the person at position `i` and the cost of bribing all people between the current position and the new position.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the minimum cost `pergunta` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic of the program is correct in that it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people.
- The use of `min(a[i], b[i])` ensures that the program always chooses the cheaper option between bribing the person at position `i` and bribing the people between the current position and the new position.
- The update of `pergunta` ensures that the program keeps track of the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` people.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge case where `m` is equal to `n` correctly. In this case, Kirill can stay in his original position without any cost.
- The program also handles the case where `m` is 1 correctly, as it will only consider the cost of moving to the first position.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people in the queue.

### Correctness:
**True**
