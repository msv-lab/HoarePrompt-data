### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `numCasos`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')`, which is a good starting point for finding the minimum cost.

3. **Bribery Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates from the last person in the queue to the first person.
   - For each person `i`, it checks if `i` is within the acceptable range to be bribed (i.e., `i < m`).
   - If `i` is within the range, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and the cost of bribing the person at position `i` plus the accumulated cost `x`.
   - It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`, which represents the total cost of the minimum bribes from the last person to the first person.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the function prints `pergunta`, which should be the minimum cost required for Kirill to reach a position no greater than `m`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `m` is equal to `n` (Kirill is already at the end of the line).
   - It also handles the case where `m` is 1 (Kirill needs to bribe everyone to get to the front).

6. **Complexity**:
   - The program iterates through the list `a` and `b` once for each test case, making the time complexity O(n) per test case.
   - Given the constraints, the total time complexity is O(t * n), which is efficient for the given limits.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum cost for Kirill to bribe people to reach a position no greater than `m`. The reasoning and the steps taken in the function are logically sound and align with the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
