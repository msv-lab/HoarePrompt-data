### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `numCasos`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')`, which is a good choice to ensure that any valid cost will be less than this initial value.

3. **Loop Through the Queue:**
   - The program iterates through the queue from the last person to the first person using a for loop with `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`.
   - This loop is designed to simulate Kirill moving forward in the queue by bribing people.

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - For each person `i` in the queue:
     - If `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of the current `pergunta` and the cost of moving to position `i` (which is `x + a[i]`).
     - It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`. This step is crucial because it accounts for the cost of bribing the person at position `i` and the cost of bribing all people between the current position and the new position.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the minimum cost `pergunta` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic of the program is mostly correct, but there is a subtle issue in the cost calculation.
- The update `pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])` is intended to keep track of the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` people.
- However, the variable `x` is accumulating the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each person, which is not entirely correct. `x` should only accumulate the costs of the people Kirill actually bribes, not the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all people.

### Corrected Logic:
- The variable `x` should only accumulate the costs of the people Kirill bribes to move to a position within the first `m` people.
- The current logic might lead to incorrect results because it does not properly account for the cumulative cost of bribing specific people.

### Example:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  1
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  ```
- The correct output should be `14` (bribing the 3rd person and the 2nd person).
- The current program might incorrectly calculate the cost because it does not properly accumulate the costs of the people Kirill actually bribes.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical flaw in the way it accumulates the costs. The variable `x` should only accumulate the costs of the people Kirill bribes to move to a position within the first `m` people, not the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all people.
