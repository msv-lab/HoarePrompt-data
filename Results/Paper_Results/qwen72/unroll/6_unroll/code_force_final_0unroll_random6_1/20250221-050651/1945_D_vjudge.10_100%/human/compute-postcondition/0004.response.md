The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `pergunta`: an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4).
- `a`: a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` represents the cost to bribe the i-th person in the queue (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
- `b`: a list of `n` integers where each `b_i` represents the cost to bribe each person between the i-th and the person Kirill is currently bribing (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).
- `n`: an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000).
- `m`: an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n).

The function returns the minimum total cost required for Kirill to bribe the people in the queue to reach a position no greater than `m`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `pergunta`, a list of integers `a`, a list of integers `b`, an integer `n`, and an integer `m`. It returns the minimum total cost required for Kirill to bribe the people in the queue to reach a position no greater than `m`.**
