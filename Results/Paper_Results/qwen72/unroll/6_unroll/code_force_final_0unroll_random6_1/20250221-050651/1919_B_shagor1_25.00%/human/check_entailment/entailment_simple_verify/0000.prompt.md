You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-". For each test case, `1 <= t <= 1000` and `1 <= n <= 5000`.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
        
    #State: `neg` is the number of "-" characters in the string `s`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
    #This is printed: n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where n is the length of the string s and neg is the number of "-" characters in s)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the optimal splitting of the array correctly to minimize the penalty. The function `func_1` simply calculates the number of '-' characters and uses this to compute the penalty, but it does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
++--
```
The optimal way to split this string to minimize the penalty would be `([1, 1, -1, -1])`, which results in a penalty of `0` (since the sum of the array is `0` and the length is `4`, so `|0| * 4 = 0`). However, the given program will output `4 - 2 * 2 = 0`, which is correct in this case, but it does not handle all cases correctly.

Another example where it fails:
```
1
6
+-+---
```
The optimal way to split this string to minimize the penalty would be `([1, -1, 1], [-1, -1, -1])`, which results in a penalty of `|1| * 3 + |-3| * 3 = 3 + 9 = 12`. However, the given program will output `6 - 2 * 3 = 0`, which is incorrect.

The program needs to consider the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty, which it does not do. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
