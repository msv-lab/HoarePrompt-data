To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `neg` is the number of "-" characters in the string `s`.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged (but they are not used in the `print` statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `n`**:
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.

2. **Determine the value of `neg`**:
   - `neg` is the number of "-" characters in the string `s`.

3. **Evaluate the condition `n != neg`**:
   - If the length of the string `s` (`n`) is not equal to the number of "-" characters in `s` (`neg`), then the expression `n - 2 * neg` will be printed.
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, then `n` will be printed.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: If `n` is not equal to `neg`:
  - The expression `n - 2 * neg` will be evaluated and printed.
  - This means the output will be the length of the string `s` minus twice the number of "-" characters in `s`.

- **Scenario 2**: If `n` is equal to `neg`:
  - The expression `n` will be printed.
  - This means the output will be the length of the string `s`.

### Final Output:
- If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the output will be `n - 2 * neg`.
- If `n` is equal to `neg`, the output will be `n`.

Output: **n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where n is the length of the string s and neg is the number of "-" characters in s)**
