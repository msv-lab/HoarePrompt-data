Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the chessboard size `n` is 1 and `k` is 0. According to the problem description, if `n` is 1 and `k` is 0, there should be exactly one final configuration possible, which is an empty board. However, the program will call `func_1(1)`, which returns 1, but the logic inside `func_1` is not designed to handle such a small `n` value correctly. The dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` is initialized with `[1, 1]`, and the loop starts from 2, which means it does not correctly compute the result for `n = 1`. This is a specific edge case where the program fails to produce the correct output.
