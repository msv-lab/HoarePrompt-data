The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 300,000 and returns the value of `dp[n]`, where `dp` is a list that dynamically computes and stores values based on a specific formula. After the function concludes, the list `dp` contains the last two computed values, but only the value at `dp[n]` is returned. The function effectively calculates a sequence value using a rolling array technique to optimize memory usage.
