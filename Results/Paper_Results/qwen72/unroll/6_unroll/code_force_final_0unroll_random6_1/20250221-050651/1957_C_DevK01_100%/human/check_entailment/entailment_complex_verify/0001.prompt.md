You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
        
        dp.pop(0)
        
    #State: `dp` is a list with values [dp[n-1], dp[n]].
    return dp[-1]
    #The program returns the value of `dp[n]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 300,000 and returns the value of `dp[n]`, where `dp` is a list that dynamically computes and stores values based on a specific formula. After the function concludes, the list `dp` contains the last two computed values, but only the value at `dp[n]` is returned. The function effectively calculates a sequence value using a rolling array technique to optimize memory usage.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to determine the number of remaining valid positions on the board.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - For each move `(a, b)`, the program checks if `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - If `a != b`, it means the computer will place a rook at `(b, a)`, which is a different position. Therefore, both positions `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are occupied, reducing the number of available positions by 2.
   - If `a == b`, the computer skips its turn, and only one position `(a, a)` is occupied, reducing the number of available positions by 1.

3. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to compute the number of possible final configurations for the remaining `n` positions.
   - The dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` is initialized with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`, representing the base cases where there are 1 way to place 0 rooks and 1 way to place 1 rook.
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, the DP array is updated using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the number of ways to place `i` rooks on an `i x i` board:
     - `dp[i-1]` represents the number of ways to place `i-1` rooks and leave one row and one column free.
     - `2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` represents the number of ways to place the `i`-th rook in one of the `i-1` free rows and columns, and then place the remaining `i-2` rooks in the remaining `i-2` rows and columns.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
  - It reads the size of the board `n` and the number of moves `k` for each test case.
  - It reads the `k` moves and processes them to update the number of available positions.

- **Move Processing:**
  - The program correctly reduces the number of available positions based on whether the move is mirrored or not.

- **Dynamic Programming:**
  - The DP formula used in `func_1(n)` is correct for counting the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a board.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow and is within the required range.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
