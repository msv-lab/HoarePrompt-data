### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to determine the number of remaining valid positions on the board.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - The program correctly checks if `a` is not equal to `b` for each move `(a, b)`.
   - If `a != b`, it reduces the number of available positions by 2, as both `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are occupied.
   - If `a == b`, it reduces the number of available positions by 1, as only one position `(a, a)` is occupied.

3. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to compute the number of possible final configurations for the remaining `n` positions.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`, which are the correct base cases:
     - `dp[0] = 1` because there is exactly one way to place 0 rooks on a board (do nothing).
     - `dp[1] = 1` because there is exactly one way to place 1 rook on a 1x1 board (place it in the only available position).
   - The DP formula used is:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula is correct for counting the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a board:
     - `dp[i-1]` represents the number of ways to place `i-1` rooks and leave one row and one column free.
     - `2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` represents the number of ways to place the `i`-th rook in one of the `i-1` free rows and columns, and then place the remaining `i-2` rooks in the remaining `i-2` rows and columns.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Challenging the Original Assessment:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 1 or when `k` is 0.
  - For `n = 1` and `k = 0`, the program correctly computes `dp[1] = 1`.
  - For `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the program correctly reduces `n` to 0 and returns `dp[0] = 1`.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program uses a rolling array technique to optimize memory usage, which is efficient for large values of `n` up to 300,000.
  - The time complexity of `func_1(n)` is \(O(n)\), which is suitable given the constraints.

- **Correctness of DP Formula:**
  - The DP formula is mathematically sound and correctly accounts for the placement of rooks in a way that avoids attacks.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow and is within the required range.

### Final Evaluation:

The program correctly implements the logic for solving the problem as described. It handles all edge cases, uses an efficient DP approach, and correctly computes the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Final: **True**
