Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 or 1, representing whether a cell is free or contains a chip, respectively. At least one cell in each test case contains a chip.**
