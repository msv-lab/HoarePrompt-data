The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of length `n` containing 0s and 1s. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the ribbon. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the variables `n`, `a`, and `res` are in the state of the last test case processed, but their values are not meaningful outside this context.
