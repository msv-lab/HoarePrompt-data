### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of cell states `a`.

2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program removes leading zeros from the list `a` using a while loop. This is done to ignore free cells that are to the left of all chips.
   - Similarly, it removes trailing zeros from the list `a` using another while loop. This is done to ignore free cells that are to the right of all chips.
   - These steps are necessary because the goal is to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them, and leading or trailing zeros do not affect the operations needed to achieve this.

3. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros, the program iterates through the remaining list `a` and counts the number of free cells (i.e., cells with `0`).
   - The number of free cells counted is the number of operations required to move all chips to form a single block without any free cells between them. This is because each free cell in the middle of the list represents a gap that needs to be filled by moving a chip.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of operations required.

### Analysis of the Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `8`, `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
   - Free cells in the middle: 1
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `6`, `0 1 0 0 0 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1`
   - Free cells in the middle: 0
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `6`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Free cells in the middle: 0
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `5`, `1 0 1 0 1`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 0 1 0 1`
   - Free cells in the middle: 2
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `9`, `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
   - Free cells in the middle: 3
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

### Additional Considerations:
- The program assumes valid inputs, as specified in the problem description.
- The program correctly handles the edge case where there are no free cells between the first and last chip.
- The program also correctly handles the case where the ribbon is already in the desired state (i.e., all chips are in a single block).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem by removing leading and trailing zeros and then counting the free cells in the middle. The approach ensures that the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips is calculated accurately for all given test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
