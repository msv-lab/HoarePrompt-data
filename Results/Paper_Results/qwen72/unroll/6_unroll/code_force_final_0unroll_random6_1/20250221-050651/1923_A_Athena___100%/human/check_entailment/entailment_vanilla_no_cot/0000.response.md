Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of cell states `a`.

2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Zeros**: The program removes all leading zeros (cells that are free and to the left of all chips) and all trailing zeros (cells that are free and to the right of all chips). This is done using two `while` loops:
   - The first `while` loop removes leading zeros by popping elements from the start of the list `a` until the first element is not zero.
   - The second `while` loop removes trailing zeros by popping elements from the end of the list `a` until the last element is not zero.

3. **Counting Gaps**: After removing the leading and trailing zeros, the program counts the number of zeros (free cells) that remain in the list `a`. These zeros represent the gaps between the chips that need to be filled to form a single block.

4. **Outputting the Result**: The program prints the count of these gaps, which corresponds to the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

### Explanation of Correctness:

- **Leading and Trailing Zeros**: Removing leading and trailing zeros is essential because these cells do not affect the number of operations needed to form a single block of chips. The operations only concern the chips and the free cells between them.

- **Counting Gaps**: The remaining zeros in the list `a` are the gaps between the chips. Each gap can be filled by moving a chip from the right to the left, and the number of such moves is exactly the number of gaps.

- **Output**: The program correctly outputs the number of gaps, which is the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Test Case 1**: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
  - Gaps: 1
  - Output: 1

- **Test Case 2**: `0 1 0 0 0 0`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1`
  - Gaps: 0
  - Output: 0

- **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Gaps: 0
  - Output: 0

- **Test Case 4**: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - Gaps: 2
  - Output: 2

- **Test Case 5**: `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
  - Gaps: 3
  - Output: 3

The program handles all these cases correctly, and thus, the correctness is **True**.
