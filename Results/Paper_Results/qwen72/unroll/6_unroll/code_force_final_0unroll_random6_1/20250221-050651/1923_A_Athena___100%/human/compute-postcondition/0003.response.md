The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 or 1, representing whether a cell is free or contains a chip, respectively. At least one cell in each test case contains a chip. The function returns the result of processing each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of length `n` containing 0s and 1s. It returns the result of processing each test case, where each result is based on the configuration of chips in the ribbon.**
