### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows the program to handle the smallest counts first, which is essential for maximizing the score.

3. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program initializes `ans` with the smallest value in `a` (i.e., `a[0]`).
   - It also initializes `res` with `n - 1`, which represents the number of distinct values in `a` that are not yet equal to `ans`.

4. **Balancing the Counts:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list `a` to balance the counts of cards.
   - For each element `a[i + 1]`, it calculates the difference `dif` from the current `ans`.
   - If `k` is sufficient to make `a[i + 1]` equal to `ans + dif`, it updates `ans` and reduces `k` accordingly.
   - If `k` is not sufficient, it updates `ans` and `res` based on the remaining `k` and breaks the loop.

5. **Final Adjustments:**
   - If `k` is still not zero after the loop, it further increases `ans` by `k // n` and adjusts `res` by `k % n`.
   - The final score is calculated by adding `ans` to `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` and `res`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program appends the final score `ans` to `ans_list` and prints each value in `ans_list` after processing all test cases.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Balancing the Counts:**
  - The program ensures that the counts of cards are as balanced as possible by incrementing the smallest counts first.
  - This approach is optimal because it maximizes the number of subarrays that can form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

- **Final Adjustments:**
  - The program correctly handles the remaining `k` by distributing it evenly across all `n` types of cards.
  - The final score calculation is based on the number of complete permutations that can be formed and the remaining cards.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `1 10`, `1`
  - Output: `11`
  - Reason: The program correctly calculates that with 10 coins, you can create 11 subarrays of `[1]`.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `2 4`, `8 4`
  - Output: `15`
  - Reason: The program correctly calculates that by buying 4 cards of type 2, you can create 15 subarrays that are permutations of `[1, 2]`.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `3 4`, `6 1 8`
  - Output: `15`
  - Reason: The program correctly balances the counts and calculates the maximum score.

The program appears to correctly implement the logic for maximizing the score based on the given problem description and the provided examples. The execution summary also aligns with the expected behavior of the program.
