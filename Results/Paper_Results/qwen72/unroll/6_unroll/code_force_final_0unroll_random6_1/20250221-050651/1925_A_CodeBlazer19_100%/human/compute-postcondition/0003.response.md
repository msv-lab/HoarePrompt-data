The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `k`. The constraints for these parameters are 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, both constrained to the range 1 to 26. It returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
