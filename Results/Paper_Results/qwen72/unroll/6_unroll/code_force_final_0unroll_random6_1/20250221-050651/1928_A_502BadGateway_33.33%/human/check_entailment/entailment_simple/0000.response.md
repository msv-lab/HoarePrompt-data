Reasoning:  
The given program is incorrect. The logic implemented in `func_1` only checks if `b` is an even number, but this is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the original `a x b` rectangle. The problem requires that the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles, and then these two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a different rectangle (considering that rectangles are the same if they differ only by a 90Â° rotation).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
1. If either `a` or `b` is 1, then the rectangle can only be cut into smaller rectangles of size `1 x 1`, and no other rectangle can be formed.
2. If both `a` and `b` are greater than 1, then Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a different rectangle.

The program should check if at least one of `a` or `b` is greater than 1 and if the product of `a` and `b` is even (i.e., at least one of `a` or `b` is even). This is because:
- If both `a` and `b` are 1, no cut can be made.
- If one of `a` or `b` is 1 and the other is even, the cut will result in two rectangles of size `1 x (even/2)`, which can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are greater than 1, the cut will always result in two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

The current implementation only checks if `b` is even, which is not enough to cover all cases.

Correctness: **False**
