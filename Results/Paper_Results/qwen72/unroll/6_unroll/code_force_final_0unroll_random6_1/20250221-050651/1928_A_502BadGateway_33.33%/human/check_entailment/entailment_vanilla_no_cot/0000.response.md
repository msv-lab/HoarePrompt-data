Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program is incorrect because it only checks if the side `b` of the rectangle is even. However, based on the problem description, Bob can cut the rectangle along either side `a` or side `b` to form two smaller rectangles, and then try to form a new rectangle from these pieces. The program should consider both sides `a` and `b` to determine if it's possible to form a different rectangle.

The correct logic should be:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, then Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle that is different from the original one.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, then Bob cannot form a different rectangle.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

This version checks if either `a` or `b` is even, which is the correct condition to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle.
