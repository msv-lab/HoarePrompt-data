Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the game logic for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Alice
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Bob
```

The program incorrectly outputs "Bob" for this case. According to the game rules, Alice can win by choosing \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, which will leave the piles as \( [0, 1, 3] \). Then, Bob will have to choose \( k = 1 \) again, leaving the piles as \( [0, 0, 2] \). Finally, Alice can choose \( k = 2 \) to empty the last pile and win the game. The program's logic does not account for this optimal play strategy.
