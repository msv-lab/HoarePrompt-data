### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - It initializes an array `answers` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It reads the list of integers `array` and splits it into individual strings.

2. **Digit Counting and Leading Zeros:**
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to count the total number of digits in the list.
   - It also initializes an array `zeros` to store the number of trailing zeros for each integer.
   - For each integer in the list, it adds the length of the integer to `total_digits`.
   - It calls `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in the integer and appends the result to `zeros`.

3. **Trailing Zeros Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given string representation of an integer.
   - It iterates from the end of the string and increments a counter until it encounters a non-zero digit.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the `zeros` array in descending order.
   - It calculates `subtract_zero` by summing every second element in the sorted `zeros` array (starting from the first element).
   - The idea behind this is to simulate Anna's optimal play, where she reverses the digits of the integers with the most trailing zeros first, which can potentially reduce the number of digits in the final concatenated number.
   - The program then checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - If `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1`, it means that the final number can be made to have at least `m + 1` digits, which would make Sasha win.
   - Otherwise, Anna wins.

6. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program's logic and implementation appear to be correct based on the problem description. It correctly handles the input, counts the digits and trailing zeros, and applies the optimal play strategy to determine the winner. The final condition for determining the winner is also correct.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
