### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `array` and converts it to a list of strings to facilitate digit manipulation.

2. **Digit Counting**:
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to 0 and `zeros` to an empty list.
   - It iterates over each item in the `array`, adding the length of each item to `total_digits`.
   - It also calls `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in each item and appends the count to the `zeros` list.

3. **Trailing Zeros Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given number (represented as a string).
   - The program then sorts the `zeros` list in descending order.

4. **Subtracting Trailing Zeros**:
   - The program initializes `subtract_zero` to 0.
   - It iterates over the `zeros` list in steps of 2, adding the counts of trailing zeros to `subtract_zero`. This is done to simulate the effect of Anna's moves, where she can reverse the digits of an element, potentially removing trailing zeros.

5. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If this condition is met, it means that after all possible moves, the resulting number will have at least `m + 1` digits, making Sasha the winner.
   - Otherwise, Anna wins.

6. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
- **Trailing Zeros Handling**: The program assumes that the number of trailing zeros can be subtracted in pairs. However, this might not accurately reflect the game's rules, especially if the number of trailing zeros is odd. The correct approach should consider the maximum possible reduction in the total number of digits, not just pairs of trailing zeros.
- **Optimal Play**: The program does not fully simulate the game's optimal play. It only considers the total number of digits and the trailing zeros, which might not be sufficient to determine the winner in all cases.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, particularly the handling of trailing zeros and the lack of a full simulation of the game's optimal play, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
