### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - It initializes an array `answers` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It reads the list of integers `array` and splits it into individual strings.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to count the total number of digits in the list.
   - It also initializes an array `zeros` to store the number of trailing zeros for each integer.
   - For each integer in the list, it adds the length of the integer to `total_digits`.
   - It calls `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in the integer and appends the result to `zeros`.

3. **Function `func_1` Summary:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given string representation of an integer.
   - It iterates from the end of the string and increments a counter until it encounters a non-zero digit.
   - The function returns the count of trailing zeros.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the `zeros` array in descending order.
   - It calculates `subtract_zero` by summing every second element in the sorted `zeros` array (starting from the first element).
   - The idea behind this is to simulate Anna's optimal play, where she reverses the digits of the integers with the most trailing zeros first, which can potentially reduce the number of digits in the final concatenated number.
   - However, this strategy is not entirely correct. Anna's optimal play is to reverse the digits of the integers to minimize the number of digits in the final concatenated number, not just to remove trailing zeros. The program's approach of removing trailing zeros might not always lead to the optimal result.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1`, it means that the final number can be made to have at least `m + 1` digits, which would make Sasha win.
   - Otherwise, Anna wins.

### Analysis of the Strategy:

- **Anna's Optimal Play:**
  - Anna should reverse the digits of the integers to minimize the number of digits in the final concatenated number. This means she should focus on reducing the number of digits in the largest numbers, not just the trailing zeros.
  - The program's approach of removing trailing zeros does not necessarily lead to the smallest possible final number. For example, reversing `1000` to `0001` (which becomes `1` after removing leading zeros) is more effective than just removing the trailing zeros.

- **Sasha's Optimal Play:**
  - Sasha should concatenate the integers in such a way that the resulting number has the maximum possible number of digits. This means he should concatenate the largest numbers first.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `2 2`, `14 2`
  - Anna can reverse `2` to `2` or `14` to `41`.
  - Sasha can concatenate `2` and `14` to get `214` or `14` and `2` to get `142`.
  - Both results are greater than or equal to `10^2 = 100`, so Sasha wins.
  - The program correctly outputs `Sasha`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `3 5`, `9 56 1`
  - Anna can reverse `9` to `9`, `56` to `65`, or `1` to `1`.
  - Sasha can concatenate `9` and `56` to get `956` or `569`, and then concatenate the result with `1` to get `9561` or `1956` or `5691` or `1569`.
  - The final number will always be less than `10^5 = 100000`, so Anna wins.
  - The program correctly outputs `Anna`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `4 10`, `1 2007 800 1580`
  - Anna can reverse `1` to `1`, `2007` to `7002`, `800` to `8`, and `1580` to `851`.
  - Sasha can concatenate `7002` and `8` to get `70028`, and then concatenate the result with `851` and `1` to get `700288511` or `170028851`.
  - The final number will always be greater than or equal to `10^10 = 10000000000`, so Sasha wins.
  - The program correctly outputs `Sasha`.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `4 5`, `5000 123 30 4`
  - Anna can reverse `5000` to `4`, `123` to `321`, `30` to `3`, and `4` to `4`.
  - Sasha can concatenate `321` and `4` to get `3214`, and then concatenate the result with `3` and `4` to get `321434` or `432143`.
  - The final number will always be less than `10^5 = 100000`, so Anna wins.
  - The program correctly outputs `Anna`.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic for counting trailing zeros and using them to determine the winner is not entirely correct. Anna's optimal play involves reversing the digits to minimize the number of digits in the final concatenated number, not just removing trailing zeros. The program's approach might lead to incorrect results in some cases.
