Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `m`, and the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting**: The program counts the total number of digits in the list of integers (`total_digits`). This is done by converting each integer to a string and summing the lengths of these strings.

3. **Trailing Zeros Calculation**: The function `func_1` is intended to count the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of an integer. However, the function is called with a string, not a list of integers, which is correct. The function correctly counts the trailing zeros and returns this count.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy**:
   - **Anna's Move**: Anna's move involves reversing the digits of a number. This operation does not change the total number of digits in the list.
   - **Sasha's Move**: Sasha's move involves concatenating two numbers, which reduces the total number of elements in the list by one but increases the total number of digits.

5. **Winning Condition**:
   - The game ends when there is exactly one number left in the list.
   - Sasha wins if the final number has at least `m + 1` digits.
   - Anna wins otherwise.

6. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list (`total_digits`).
   - It then calculates the number of trailing zeros in each number and stores them in the `zeros` list.
   - The `zeros` list is sorted in descending order.
   - The program then subtracts the number of trailing zeros in pairs from `total_digits` to account for the fact that leading zeros are removed after concatenation.
   - If the resulting number of digits (`abs(total_digits - subtract_zero)`) is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna wins.

7. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of an integer.
   - The function is called with a string, which is appropriate given the context of the problem.

8. **Output**: The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic for determining the winner:
- The program assumes that the number of trailing zeros in pairs should be subtracted from the total number of digits. This is not entirely accurate because the trailing zeros are only relevant when considering the final concatenated number, not the intermediate steps.

To correctly determine the winner, we need to consider the following:
- Anna's move does not change the total number of digits.
- Sasha's move concatenates two numbers, which can potentially create a number with more digits, but the trailing zeros are only relevant in the final concatenated number.

The correct approach would be to:
- Count the total number of digits in the list.
- Check if the total number of digits is already greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If so, Sasha wins.
- Otherwise, Anna wins because she can always reverse the digits of a number without changing the total number of digits, and Sasha will eventually be forced to concatenate numbers that do not reach `m + 1` digits.

Given the current implementation, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program should not be subtracting trailing zeros in pairs from the total number of digits.

Correctness: **False**

The program's logic for determining the winner is incorrect. It should simply check if the total number of digits in the list is greater than or equal to `m + 1` to determine the winner.
