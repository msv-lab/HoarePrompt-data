You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
from math import gcd
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
    vprod = [den // r for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if den <= 0:
        print(-1)
        return
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers `vals` from the user. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in `vals` and stores it in `den`. It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. The function updates `den` to `den - sum(vprod)`. If the updated `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `den` is updated, `vals` remains unchanged, and `N` remains unchanged.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is the bet on that outcome multiplied by \( k_i \).

2. **Algorithm Overview:**
   - The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \) to determine a common denominator.
   - It then calculates the bet for each outcome as the LCM divided by the corresponding multiplier.
   - Finally, it checks if the total bet is less than the LCM. If it is, the solution is valid; otherwise, it outputs -1.

3. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.
   - The LCM is calculated using the formula: \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \).
   - This function is correct and efficiently computes the LCM.

4. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - **Input Reading:**
     - The function reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).
   - **LCM Calculation:**
     - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier and then iterates through the list of multipliers, updating `den` to be the LCM of `den` and the current multiplier.
   - **Bet Calculation:**
     - It calculates the bet for each outcome as `den // r` where `r` is the multiplier.
   - **Total Bet Check:**
     - It calculates the total bet as the sum of all bets.
     - It then checks if the total bet is less than `den`. If it is, the solution is valid; otherwise, it outputs -1.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets are distributed in such a way that the total bet is a multiple of each multiplier.
   - The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the LCM, which means the total bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - If the condition is not met, it means there is no way to distribute the coins as required, and the function correctly outputs -1.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the sum of the bets is equal to or greater than the LCM, which is the correct behavior.
   - It also handles the case where the multipliers are all the same, which can result in no valid distribution (as seen in the third test case).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the bets and checks the conditions to ensure a valid distribution of coins.

Correctness: **True**
