Reasoning:

The problem requires us to distribute coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome. This means for each outcome \(i\), the bet \(x_i\) should be such that:

\[ k_i \cdot x_i > \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j \]

where \(k_i\) is the multiplier for outcome \(i\), and \(x_j\) is the bet on outcome \(j\).

### Analysis of `func_2`:
1. **Input Reading**: The function reads the number of outcomes \(N\) and the list of multipliers `vals`.
2. **LCM Calculation**: It initializes `den` with the first element of `vals` and then iterates through the list to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `vals`. This is done using the `func_1` function, which calculates the LCM of two numbers.
3. **Bet Calculation**: It computes a list `vprod` where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. This effectively ensures that each bet \(x_i\) is a multiple of the LCM of all multipliers, which helps in ensuring the bets are consistent with the multipliers.
4. **Total Bet Calculation**: It calculates the total bet as the sum of all elements in `vprod`.
5. **Condition Check**: It checks if the total bet is less than or equal to `den`. If it is, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod`.

### Correctness:
- **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of all multipliers ensures that the bets are consistent and can be scaled appropriately.
- **Bet Calculation**: The bets \(x_i\) are calculated as \( \text{LCM} / k_i \). This ensures that the total bet is the sum of these values.
- **Condition Check**: The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the LCM, which is necessary for the inequality \( k_i \cdot x_i > \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j \) to hold for all \(i\).

### Example Verification:
- For the input `3 3 2 7`:
  - LCM of 3, 2, 7 is 42.
  - Bets are \(42 / 3 = 14\), \(42 / 2 = 21\), \(42 / 7 = 6\).
  - Total bet is \(14 + 21 + 6 = 41\).
  - For each outcome:
    - \(3 \cdot 14 = 42 > 41\)
    - \(2 \cdot 21 = 42 > 41\)
    - \(7 \cdot 6 = 42 > 41\)
  - The condition is satisfied, so the output is correct.

- For the input `2 3 3`:
  - LCM of 3, 3 is 3.
  - Bets are \(3 / 3 = 1\), \(3 / 3 = 1\).
  - Total bet is \(1 + 1 = 2\).
  - For each outcome:
    - \(3 \cdot 1 = 3 > 2\)
    - \(3 \cdot 1 = 3 > 2\)
  - The condition is satisfied, so the output is correct.

- For the input `5 5 5 5 5 5`:
  - LCM of 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 is 5.
  - Bets are \(5 / 5 = 1\), \(5 / 5 = 1\), \(5 / 5 = 1\), \(5 / 5 = 1\), \(5 / 5 = 1\).
  - Total bet is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5\).
  - For each outcome:
    - \(5 \cdot 1 = 5 \not> 5\)
  - The condition is not satisfied, so the output is correct as `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of coins for each test case, and it handles cases where no valid distribution exists by printing `-1`. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.

Correctness: **True**
