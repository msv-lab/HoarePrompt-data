Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, inclusive; `p` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 <= `p[i]` <= `n`, `p[i]` != `i`, and all elements in `p` are distinct; `v` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`.** 

The code initializes `v` as a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The values of `n` and `p` remain unchanged.
