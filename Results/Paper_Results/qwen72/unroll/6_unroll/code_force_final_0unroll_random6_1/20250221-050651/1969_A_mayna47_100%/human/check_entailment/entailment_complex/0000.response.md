Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. The function `func_1` reads the number of friends `n` and their best friend list `p`, and then it checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, the function prints `2` because inviting both friends in the pair will ensure they both come to the party. If no such pair is found, the function prints `3` because, in the worst case, Monocarp needs to invite 3 friends to ensure at least 2 come (since inviting 2 friends who are not a pair will not guarantee that both will come, but inviting 3 will ensure at least one pair or two friends whose best friends also received invitations).

However, the program as written has a logical flaw. The list `v` is initialized twice, which is unnecessary and could be confusing. More importantly, the function only checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` if such a pair is found. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`. This approach does not correctly handle all cases, especially when there are no direct pairs but a chain of best friends that can be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

For example, consider the case where `p = [2, 3, 1, 5, 4]`. Here, there are no direct pairs (i.e., `p[p[i]] == i` is never true), but inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 would ensure that friends 1 and 2 come to the party. The function, as written, would print `3` in this case, which is correct, but it does not handle more complex cases where the minimum number of invitations might be less than 3.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should:
1. Identify all pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.
2. If such pairs exist, print `2` and return.
3. If no pairs exist, identify the smallest set of friends to invite to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. This might involve identifying chains or cycles in the best friend relationships.

Given the current implementation, the function does not correctly handle all possible cases, especially those involving chains or cycles.

Correctness: **False**
