You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of integers of length n where 1 <= p[i] <= n, p[i] != i, and all elements in p are distinct.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
        
    #State: The loop will not execute the print statement or return, so the values of `n`, `p`, and `v` remain unchanged.
    print(3)
    #This is printed: 3



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Monocarp has `n` friends.
   - Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i` such that `p_i` is distinct and `p_i` is not equal to `i`.
   - A friend `i` will come to the party if both `i` and `p_i` receive an invitation.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
   - Inside `func_1`:
     - It reads the number of friends `n`.
     - It initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros.
     - It reads the list of best friends and appends it to `v` starting from index 1.
     - It iterates through each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
     - It checks if `v[v[i]] == i`, which means if the best friend of `i`'s best friend is `i` (i.e., `i` and `p_i` form a mutual pair).
     - If such a mutual pair is found, it prints 2 and returns.
     - If no mutual pair is found, it prints 3.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - **Mutual Pair Check:**
     - The condition `v[v[i]] == i` checks if `i` and `p_i` form a mutual pair. If they do, sending invitations to both `i` and `p_i` will ensure that both come to the party, and the minimum number of invitations needed is 2.
     - This logic is correct for identifying mutual pairs.
   - **No Mutual Pair:**
     - If no mutual pair is found, the program prints 3. This is based on the assumption that if there are no mutual pairs, the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3.
     - This assumption is not always correct. For example, consider the case where `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`. Here, no mutual pairs exist, but sending invitations to friends 1, 2, and 3 will ensure that friends 1 and 2 come to the party. However, sending invitations to friends 1, 2, and 4 will also ensure that friends 1 and 2 come to the party, and the minimum number of invitations needed is still 3.

4. **Identifying the Flaw:**
   - The program does not handle cases where there are no mutual pairs but the minimum number of invitations needed is still 2. For example, consider the case where `p = [2, 3, 1]`. Here, no mutual pairs exist, but sending invitations to friends 1 and 2 will ensure that friends 1 and 2 come to the party, and the minimum number of invitations needed is 2.
   - The program should check for the smallest set of friends that can be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, even if there are no mutual pairs.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where the minimum number of invitations needed is 2 even in the absence of mutual pairs.

### Correctness: **False**
