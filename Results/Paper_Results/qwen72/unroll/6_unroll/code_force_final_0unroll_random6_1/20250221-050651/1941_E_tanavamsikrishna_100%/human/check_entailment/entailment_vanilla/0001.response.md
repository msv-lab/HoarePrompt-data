### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a grid representing a river.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to build a single bridge on a given row.
   - It initializes the cost for the first `d` cells by adding 2 to each cell (1 for the support and 1 for the cost).
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost for the next `d` cells.
   - For each cell beyond the first `d` cells, it pops the minimum cost from the heap that is within the distance `d` and adds the current cell's cost to it.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last cell, which represents the total cost for the row.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - It reads the grid of river depths.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.
   - It prints the minimum total cost for each test case.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input is read using `input().split(' ')` and converted to integers.
   - The grid is read row by row and stored in a list of lists.
   - The output is printed for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the grid is small and the number of bridges is large.
   - The function ensures that the first and last columns always have supports, as required by the problem.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the function efficiently finds the minimum cost for each cell within the distance `d`.
   - The overall complexity is manageable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the logic for calculating the minimum cost for each row and the total cost for `k` consecutive bridges is sound.

Correctness: **True**
