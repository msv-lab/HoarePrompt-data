The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters in its function signature. However, it reads input values where `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers with the following constraints: 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. Additionally, it reads a list `rows` which contains `n` lists, each of which contains `m` integers, with the first and last integers in each row being 0, representing the river banks.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters and the list `rows`. The exact return value is not specified in the provided information, but it likely involves some computation or logic based on the given constraints and the structure of `rows`.

Functionality: **The function reads input values `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` (integers) and a list `rows` (a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers with the first and last integers being 0). It returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.**
