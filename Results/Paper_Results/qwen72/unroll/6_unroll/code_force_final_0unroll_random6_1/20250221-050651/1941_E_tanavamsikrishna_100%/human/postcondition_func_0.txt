The function `func_1` accepts a list `row` of integers where the first and last elements are 0, and a positive integer `d` such that 1 <= d < len(row). It modifies the list `row` by setting `row[0]` to 1 and incrementing each element in the range 1 to d-1 by 2. For each element in the range `d` to `len(row) - 1`, it updates the element based on the minimum value from a sliding window of size `d` in the list, adding 1 to the sum of the element and the minimum value. The function returns the value of `row[-1]`, which is the last element of the modified list.
