### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a grid, where each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Initial Setup**:
     - The function sets `row[0]` to 1, which is correct because the first column always has a support.
     - It increments each element in the range 1 to `d-1` by 2, which is incorrect. The correct cost should be `a_{i, j} + 1`, not `a_{i, j} + 2`.
   - **Heap Initialization**:
     - The function initializes a min-heap with the first `d` elements of the row, which is correct.
   - **Heap Processing**:
     - For each cell beyond the first `d` cells, it pops the minimum cost from the heap that is within the distance `d` and adds the current cell's cost to it.
     - It then pushes the current cell's updated cost back into the heap.
   - **Return Value**:
     - The function returns the cost of the last cell, which is correct as it represents the total cost for the row.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Input Reading**:
     - The function reads the input values `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` correctly.
     - It reads the grid of river depths and stores it in a list of lists.
   - **Cost Calculation**:
     - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - **Total Cost Calculation**:
     - It calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.
   - **Output**:
     - It prints the minimum total cost for each test case, which is correct.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the grid is small and the number of bridges is large.
   - It ensures that the first and last columns always have supports, as required by the problem.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the function efficiently finds the minimum cost for each cell within the distance `d`.
   - The overall complexity is manageable given the constraints.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:

- **Initial Setup**:
  - Setting `row[0]` to 1 is correct.
  - Incrementing each element in the range 1 to `d-1` by 2 is incorrect. The correct cost should be `a_{i, j} + 1`.

- **Heap Initialization**:
  - The heap is initialized correctly with the first `d` elements of the row.

- **Heap Processing**:
  - The loop correctly processes each cell beyond the first `d` cells.
  - The condition `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):` ensures that only elements within the distance `d` are considered.
  - The cost update `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` is correct, but the initial increment by 2 in the setup is not.

- **Return Value**:
  - The function returns the cost of the last cell, which is correct.

### Corrected `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(row, d):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1  # Corrected from +2 to +1
    
    min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
        heappush(min_heap, e)
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
    
    return row[-1]
```

### Final Evaluation:

- **Original Assessment**:
  - The original assessment was mostly correct in its reasoning about the overall structure and logic of the program.
  - However, it overlooked the incorrect increment by 2 in the initial setup of `func_1`.

- **Correctness**:
  - The program is incorrect due to the initial increment by 2 in `func_1`, which should be corrected to +1.

Final: **False**
