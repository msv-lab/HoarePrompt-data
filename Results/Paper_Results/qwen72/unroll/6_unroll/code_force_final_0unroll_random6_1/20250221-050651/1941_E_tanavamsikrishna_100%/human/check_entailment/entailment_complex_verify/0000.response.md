### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires building bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid, where the cost of installing a support in a cell is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - Supports must be installed at the river banks (first and last columns) and the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the minimum cost to install supports on a single row.
   - It starts by setting `row[0]` to 1 (since the first column is a river bank and the cost is `a_{i,1} + 1`).
   - It then increments each element in the range 1 to `d-1` by 2, which is incorrect because it does not consider the actual depth values in these cells.
   - The function uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost within a sliding window of size `d`.
   - For each element in the range `d` to `len(row) - 1`, it updates the element based on the minimum value from the sliding window, adding 1 to the sum of the element and the minimum value.
   - The function returns the value of `row[-1]`, which is the cost of the last support.

3. **Logical Flaw:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly enforce the condition that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
   - The increment by 2 for the first `d-1` elements is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The sliding window approach using a min-heap is a good idea, but the implementation does not ensure that supports are placed at every `d` distance or less.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     3 5 1 1
     0 1 2 3 0
     ```
   - The correct output should be `6` because supports must be placed in every cell due to `d = 1`.
   - However, the current implementation of `func_1` will not correctly handle this case. It will only consider the minimum cost within a sliding window of size `d`, but it does not ensure that supports are placed at every `d` distance or less.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` does not enforce the condition that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
   - The program will produce incorrect results in cases where the distance between supports exceeds `d`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
