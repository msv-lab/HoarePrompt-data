### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - `func_2` reads the input values `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` and initializes a list of lists `rows` to store the depths of the river cells.
   - It then computes the cost of building a bridge for each row using `func_1`.

2. **Cost Calculation in `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` modifies the row by setting `row[0]` to 1 and incrementing each element in the range 1 to `d-1` by 2.
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost within a sliding window of size `d` and updates the cost for each cell in the row.
   - The function returns the cost of the last cell in the row, which is the total cost of building the bridge for that row.

3. **Total Cost Calculation in `func_2`:**
   - After computing the cost for each row, `func_2` calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - It prints the minimum total cost among these sets.

### Analysis:

- **Sliding Window and Min-Heap:**
  - The use of a min-heap in `func_1` ensures that the function efficiently finds the minimum cost within the sliding window of size `d`.
  - This is crucial for ensuring that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost calculation in `func_1` is correct as it adds 1 to the depth of each cell where a support is installed, and it ensures that the first and last cells always have a support.
  - The sliding window approach ensures that the minimum cost for each cell is considered, which is necessary for minimizing the total cost.

- **Consecutive Rows:**
  - `func_2` correctly computes the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.
  - This ensures that the program considers all valid options for building the bridges and selects the one with the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly follows the problem description and constraints. It efficiently calculates the minimum cost for building the bridges using a combination of a sliding window and a min-heap. The logic and implementation are sound, and the program should produce the correct output for valid inputs.

### Correctness:
