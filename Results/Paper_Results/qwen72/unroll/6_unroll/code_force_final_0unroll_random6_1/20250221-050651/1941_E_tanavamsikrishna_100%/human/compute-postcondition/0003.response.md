Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers where the first and last integers in each row are 0, representing the river banks. `costs` is a list of integers, where each integer is the result of calling `func_1` on each row in `rows` with the parameter `d`. `total_costs` is an empty list.**
