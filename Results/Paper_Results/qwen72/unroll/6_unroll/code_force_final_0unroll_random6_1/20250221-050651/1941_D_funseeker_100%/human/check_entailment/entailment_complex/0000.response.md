### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1` reads a line of input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This function is used to read the input for each throw.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` by calling `func_1` and converting the result to an integer.
   - `func_3` reads the first line of each test case, which contains `n`, `m`, and `x`, and returns them as a list of integers.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - `func_4` processes each test case. It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each of the `m` throws, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c` (either '0', '1', or '?').
   - Depending on the direction `c`, it updates the set `ans` to include the possible positions of the ball after the throw. If `c` is '0', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set. If `c` is '1', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set. If `c` is '?', it adds both possible positions.
   - After processing all throws, it checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set, as the player numbered `0` is not valid and should be replaced by `n`.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the number of unique elements in the set `ans` and then prints the sorted elements of `ans`.

### Analysis:
- **Initialization and Input Handling:**
  - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` correctly handle the input as described in the problem. `func_2` reads the number of test cases, and `func_3` reads the first line of each test case, which contains `n`, `m`, and `x`.

- **Game Logic:**
  - The logic in `func_4` correctly simulates the game by updating the set `ans` with the possible positions of the ball after each throw. The use of modulo `n` ensures that the positions wrap around the circle correctly.
  - The handling of the direction `c` is correct. If `c` is '0', the ball moves clockwise, and if `c` is '1', the ball moves counterclockwise. If `c` is '?', both directions are considered.

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The function correctly handles the edge case where the position `0` is in the set `ans` by replacing it with `n`. This is necessary because player `0` is not valid, and the players are numbered from `1` to `n`.

- **Output:**
  - The function prints the number of unique elements in the set `ans` and then prints the sorted elements of `ans`, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
