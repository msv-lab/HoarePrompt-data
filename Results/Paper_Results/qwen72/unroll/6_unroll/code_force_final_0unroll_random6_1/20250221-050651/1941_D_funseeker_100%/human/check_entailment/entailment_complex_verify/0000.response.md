### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases using `func_2()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`.
   - It then reads the details of each throw (distance `r` and direction `c`) using `func_1()`.

2. **Set Operations:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` by adding the possible new positions of the ball based on the direction `c`.
   - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set.
   - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set.
   - The use of sets ensures that all positions are unique.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the ball might end up with player 0. It discards 0 from the set and adds `n` to the set.
   - This ensures that the final set `ans` only contains valid player numbers (1 to n).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.

5. **Correctness of Logic:**
   - The logic for updating the set `ans` based on the direction `c` is correct.
   - The program correctly considers both possible directions when `c` is '?'.
   - The final output is correctly formatted and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

### Evaluation of Original Assessment:

The original assessment states that the program is correct and explains why. The assessment is accurate based on the following points:

- **Input Handling:** The program correctly reads and processes the input.
- **Set Operations:** The use of sets to keep track of possible positions is appropriate and ensures uniqueness.
- **Edge Case Handling:** The program correctly handles the edge case where the ball might end up with player 0.
- **Output:** The output is correctly formatted and meets the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases and input scenarios as required. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
