Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given description. Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1()`, `func_2()`, and `func_3()` are used to read and process input efficiently.
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, `func_3()` reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x`.

2. **Processing Each Throw**:
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw, considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions if `c` is '?'.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the ball lands on player 0 (which is not a valid player number), it is adjusted to player `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of player numbers who could have the ball.

The logic and implementation seem to correctly handle the problem requirements, including the handling of unknown directions and the circular nature of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.
