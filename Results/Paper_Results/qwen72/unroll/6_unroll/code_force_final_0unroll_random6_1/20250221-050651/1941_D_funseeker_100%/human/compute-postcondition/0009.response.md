To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `ans` is a set containing all integers that can be reached by adding or subtracting multiples of `r` to the initial value `x`, modulo `n`, after `m` iterations.
   - If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` now includes `n` and excludes `0`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

2. **Understanding the Set `ans`**:
   - The set `ans` is populated by performing operations of the form \( (x + k \cdot r) \mod n \) and \( (x - k \cdot r) \mod n \) for \( k \) ranging from 0 to `m`.
   - These operations generate a set of integers that are the results of these modular arithmetic operations.

3. **Modification of `ans`**:
   - If `0` is in the set `ans`, it is replaced by `n`.
   - If `0` is not in the set `ans`, the set remains as it was after the operations.

4. **Printing the Set**:
   - The `print` statement will print the elements of the set `ans` after sorting them in ascending order.
   - The `*` before `sorted(ans)` in the `print` statement unpacks the sorted list, so the elements are printed separated by spaces.

Given this information, let's describe the output:

- **If `0` is in `ans`**:
  - `0` will be replaced by `n`.
  - The set `ans` will be sorted, and the elements will be printed in ascending order.
  - The output will include `n` and exclude `0`.

- **If `0` is not in `ans`**:
  - The set `ans` will remain unchanged.
  - The set `ans` will be sorted, and the elements will be printed in ascending order.

Since the exact values of `x`, `r`, `n`, and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `ans`. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **sorted elements of `ans` (where `ans` is a set of integers that can be reached by adding or subtracting multiples of `r` to `x`, modulo `n`, after `m` iterations, and if `0` is in `ans`, it is replaced by `n`)**
