The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value, which is the result of converting the output of `func_1()` to an integer. The state of the program before the function call, including the variables `n`, `m`, `x`, and `throws`, is not affected by the execution of `func_2`. The purpose of the function is to provide an integer output derived from `func_1()`.
