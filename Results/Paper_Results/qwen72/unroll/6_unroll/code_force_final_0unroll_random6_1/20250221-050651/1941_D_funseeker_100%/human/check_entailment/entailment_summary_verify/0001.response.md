### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read lines from the standard input, which is efficient and suitable for competitive programming.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to read and parse the input. `func_1` reads a line and strips the newline character, `func_2` converts the line to an integer, and `func_3` splits the line into a list of integers. This is a standard and correct approach.

2. **Main Function (`func_4`):**
   - The function `func_4` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x` to keep track of the possible positions of the ball. This is correct because initially, the ball is with player `x`.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the new possible positions of the ball.
   - If the direction is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If the direction is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - After processing all throws, it updates `ans` to be the set of all possible positions stored in `temp`.

4. **Handling Edge Case for Player 0:**
   - The program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and `0` would be an invalid player number. This handling is correct.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players. This is correct and matches the problem's output requirements.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic correctly handles the transitions for both clockwise and counterclockwise throws.
  - The use of sets ensures that all possible positions are unique.
  - The handling of the edge case where `0` is converted to `n` is correct.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the direction is unknown (`?`).
  - It also correctly handles the case where the direction is known (`0` or `1`).

- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of sets and the `%` operator ensures that the program efficiently handles the transitions and avoids duplicate positions.
  - The program's complexity is manageable for the given constraints (up to 1000 players and 1000 throws per test case, with up to 10,000 test cases).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately. The logic is sound, and the implementation is efficient and correct.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
