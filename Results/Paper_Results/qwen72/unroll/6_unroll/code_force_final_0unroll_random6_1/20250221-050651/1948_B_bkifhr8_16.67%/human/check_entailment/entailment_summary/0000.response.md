Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to sort an array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying an operation that splits elements greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Handling of the Split Operation**: The program attempts to split elements in the array only once, and only if they are greater than the next element in the array. This is not sufficient to ensure that the array can be sorted. The correct approach would be to repeatedly split elements until no further splits are needed, and then check if the array is sorted.

2. **Checking the Sorted Condition**: The function `func_1` correctly checks if the list is sorted. However, the program does not ensure that the array is in a state where it can be sorted after the split operations.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array. For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will only split `12` into `[1, 2]` and then check if the array is sorted, which it is not. It should continue to split `28` into `[2, 8]` and then check again, which would result in a sorted array.

4. **Infinite Loop Potential**: The current implementation could potentially lead to an infinite loop if the array is not sorted and the split operation does not make progress towards sorting the array.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
