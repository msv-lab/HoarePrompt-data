### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Operation Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the array `list1` and checks if the current element is greater than the previous element and if the previous element is greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it performs the operation by:
     - Removing the previous element.
     - Inserting the tens and units digits of the removed element back into the array at the appropriate positions.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - After potentially performing the operation, the program calls `func_1` to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The function `func_1` compares the original list `lst` with its sorted version `sorted_lst` and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating the list is sorted.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles arrays that are already sorted.
   - It also handles arrays where no elements are greater than 10, as no operations will be performed in such cases.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program only performs the operation once if the condition is met. This means it does not repeatedly apply the operation until the array is sorted or no more operations can be performed.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The program will correctly split `12` into `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, but it will not further split `45` into `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]` if needed.
   - This can lead to incorrect results in cases where multiple operations are required to sort the array.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it only performs the operation once for each test case, which is insufficient to ensure the array is sorted in all cases. It needs to repeatedly apply the operation until the array is sorted or no more operations can be performed.

### Correctness:
**False**
