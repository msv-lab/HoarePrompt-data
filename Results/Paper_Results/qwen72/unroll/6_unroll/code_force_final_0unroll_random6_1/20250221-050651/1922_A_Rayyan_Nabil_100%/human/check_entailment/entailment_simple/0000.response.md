### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not.
   - The function iterates through each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` using a loop.
   - For each index `i`, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If this condition is true for any index `i`, it returns 'YES'.
   - If the loop completes without finding such an index, it returns 'NO'.
   - This logic is correct because:
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both different from `c[i]`, we can set the template `t[i]` to be the uppercase version of `c[i]`, ensuring that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.
     - If no such index exists, it means that for every position `i`, at least one of `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches `c[i]`, making it impossible to construct a template that satisfies the conditions.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes an empty list `results` to store the results of each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1` with the parameters `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it iterates through the `results` list and prints each result.
   - This logic is correct because:
     - It correctly reads the input and processes each test case independently.
     - It stores the results of each test case and prints them in the correct order.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to handle the problem as described, and the program will produce the correct output for valid inputs.
