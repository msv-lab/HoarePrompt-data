Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if the characters in the same position of strings `a` and `b` are different from the corresponding character in string `c`. However, it does not ensure that the characters in `a` and `b` match the template conditions (lowercase letters must match exactly, and uppercase letters must not match their lowercase counterparts).

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
The program will return "YES" because `a[0] != c[0]`, `a[1] != c[1]`, and `a[2] != c[2]`. However, there is no template that can satisfy the conditions for both `a` and `b` while making `c` not match. For any template, if `a` and `b` match, `c` will also match, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
