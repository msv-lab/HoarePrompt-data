To determine what will be printed when the `print(a)` statement is executed, let's break down the initial state and the transformation applied to the list `a`.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

### Transformation:
- Elements at even indices in the list `a` are reversed.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **List `a` Creation**: The list `a` is created with integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order.
   - For example, if `n = 5`, then `a` would initially be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

2. **Reversing Elements at Even Indices**:
   - Even indices in a list are 0, 2, 4, etc.
   - The elements at these indices are reversed in place.
   - For example, if `n = 5`, the elements at even indices are `[1, 3, 5]`. Reversing these elements results in `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

### General Case:
- For any `n`, the list `a` will initially be `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
- The elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) will be reversed.
- The elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) will remain in their original positions.

### Example:
- If `n = 7`, the initial list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
- The elements at even indices are `[1, 3, 5, 7]`.
- Reversing these elements results in `[7, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 1]`.

### Final Output:
The `print(a)` statement will print the list `a` with elements at even indices reversed.

Output: **[n, 2, n-2, 4, n-4, 6, ..., 3, n-1, 1] (where the elements at even indices are reversed and the elements at odd indices remain in their original positions)**
