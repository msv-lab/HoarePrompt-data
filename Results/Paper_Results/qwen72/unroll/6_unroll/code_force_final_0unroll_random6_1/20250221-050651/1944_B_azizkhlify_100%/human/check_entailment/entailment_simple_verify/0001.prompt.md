You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: The loop will print pairs of integers and single integers from the list `a` based on the conditions provided. After all iterations, the variables `l`, `r`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` will be modified, but the initial variables `t`, `n`, and `k` will remain unchanged. The exact final values of `l`, `r`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` depend on the input values and the specific elements in the list `a`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - It also reads the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Frequency Counting:**
   - The program initializes two arrays `l` and `r` of length `n` to count the occurrences of each element in the first half and the second half of the array `a`, respectively.
   - It then iterates through the first half of `a` to populate `l` and the second half to populate `r`.

3. **Constructing Subsets `l` and `r`:**
   - The program attempts to construct the subset `l` by selecting elements that appear twice in the first half of `a`.
   - It prints these elements and updates the count in `l` to zero, ensuring they are not selected again.
   - It also keeps track of the number of elements selected for `l` using `ul`.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements for `l`:**
   - If the number of elements selected for `l` is less than `2k`, the program selects elements that appear once in the first half of `a` and stores them in `res`.
   - It prints these elements and updates the count in `l` to ensure they are not selected again.

5. **Constructing Subsets `r`:**
   - The program then constructs the subset `r` by selecting elements that appear twice in the second half of `a`.
   - It prints these elements and updates the count in `r` to zero, ensuring they are not selected again.
   - It also keeps track of the number of elements selected for `r` using `ur`.

6. **Ensuring Equal Lengths:**
   - The program ensures that the lengths of `l` and `r` are equal by selecting additional elements from the second half if necessary.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Frequency Counting:**
  - The program incorrectly updates the frequency counts in `l` and `r`. The arrays `l` and `r` are supposed to count the occurrences of each element, but the program is not correctly handling the indices.
  - For example, `l[a[i] - 1]` and `r[a[i] - 1]` should be used to count the occurrences of each element, but the program is not doing this correctly.

- **Incorrect XOR Matching:**
  - The program does not ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of elements in `r`. It only attempts to match the number of elements, not their XOR values.

- **Incorrect Subset Construction:**
  - The program constructs subsets `l` and `r` by selecting elements based on their frequency, but it does not guarantee that the selected elements will have the same XOR value.
  - The logic for selecting elements from `r` is also flawed, as it does not consider the XOR condition.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
