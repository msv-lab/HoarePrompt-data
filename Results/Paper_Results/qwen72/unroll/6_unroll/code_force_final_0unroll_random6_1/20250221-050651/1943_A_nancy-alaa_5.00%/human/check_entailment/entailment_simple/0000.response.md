### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `arr` of `n` integers.

2. **Counter Usage**:
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. This is a valid and efficient way to track the frequency of each element.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning Alice will try to maximize the MEX and Bob will try to minimize it.
   - The program iterates through the range `[0, n-1]` to find the smallest integer `i` that is not in `arr` or appears only once in `arr` and is chosen by Alice first.

4. **Logic**:
   - The variable `first` is used to track whether Alice has encountered a unique integer (i.e., an integer that appears exactly once in `arr`).
   - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it means `i` is not present in `arr`, and the program prints `i` and breaks the loop. This is correct because the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array.
   - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`, it means Alice has already chosen a unique integer, and Bob will choose the next unique integer. The program prints `i` and breaks the loop. This is correct because Bob will try to minimize the MEX.
   - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i] == 1`, it means Alice has found a unique integer, and the program sets `first` to `True`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where all integers from `0` to `n-1` are present in `arr` by correctly printing the smallest integer that is not in `arr`.
   - The program also handles the case where there are multiple unique integers by ensuring that Alice and Bob play optimally.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct MEX for each test case based on the optimal strategy of both players.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob and correctly calculates the MEX for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
