### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move given the current state of the game.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - Alice can only append elements to `c`, while Bob can only delete elements from `a`.
   - Alice starts first, and each player takes turns until `a` is empty.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice should try to include the smallest possible integers in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should try to remove the smallest possible integers from `a` to minimize the MEX.
   - If an integer `i` appears only once in `a`, Alice will try to include it in `c` on her first opportunity, and Bob will try to remove it to prevent Alice from doing so.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the integers from 0 to `n-1` to find the smallest integer `i` that is not in `a` or appears only once in `a` and is the first such integer Alice can pick.
   - The variable `first` is used to track whether Alice has encountered an integer that appears only once in `a`.

5. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Input Reading:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - **Counting Occurrences:**
     - It uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - **Finding the MEX:**
     - It iterates through the integers from 0 to `n-1`.
     - If an integer `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it means `i` is not in `arr`, and the MEX is `i`.
     - If an integer `i` appears only once in `arr` and `first` is `True`, it means Alice has already picked such an integer, and the MEX is `i`.
     - If an integer `i` appears only once in `arr` and `first` is `False`, it sets `first` to `True` to indicate that Alice will pick this integer on her next turn.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `a` is empty or contains only one element.
   - It also correctly handles the case where all integers in `a` are unique or where some integers appear more than once.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. It finds the MEX of the array `c` that Alice constructs by considering the smallest integers and their occurrences in `a`.

### Correctness:
**True**
