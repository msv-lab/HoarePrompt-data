The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr`. It then identifies the first integer in the range [0, n) that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once after a previously seen unique integer. The function prints this integer and moves on to the next test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed, and the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
