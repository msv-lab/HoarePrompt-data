Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem by leveraging the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each number in the array. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
2. It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
3. It then iterates through the range `[0, n)` to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array or appears exactly once after a previously seen unique integer.

The key points to verify for correctness are:
- The program correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` that Alice and Bob are constructing.
- The program ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning Alice tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it.

### Analysis:
- **MEX Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the MEX by iterating through the range `[0, n)` and checking if each integer is in the `Counter` or appears exactly once after a previously seen unique integer. This approach ensures that the smallest missing integer is found.
- **Optimal Play**: The program implicitly handles the optimal play by the following logic:
  - If an integer `i` does not appear in `arr`, it is the MEX and the game ends.
  - If an integer `i` appears exactly once and it is the first such integer encountered, Alice will pick it to maximize the MEX.
  - If an integer `i` appears exactly once and it is not the first such integer encountered, Bob will pick it to minimize the MEX.

### Test Cases:
- **Case 1**: `n = 4`, `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
  - The smallest missing integer is 2, which is the MEX.
- **Case 2**: `n = 4`, `arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
  - The smallest missing integer is 1, which is the MEX.
- **Case 3**: `n = 2`, `arr = [1, 1]`
  - The smallest missing integer is 0, which is the MEX.

The program correctly handles these cases and prints the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by identifying the MEX of the array `c` that Alice and Bob construct, and it handles the optimal play strategy as described.

Correctness: **True**
