You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9) and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The length of test_cases is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        mod_x_map = {}
        
        mod_y_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = -num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
            mod_x_key = num % x
            mod_y_key = num % y
            mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: The `results` list will contain the count of pairs (i, j) for each test case, where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and (a_i + a_j) % x = 0 or (a_i - a_j) % y = 0. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged.
    return results
    #The program returns the `results` list, which contains the count of pairs (i, j) for each test case, where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and (a_i + a_j) % x = 0 or (a_i - a_j) % y = 0. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of test cases, each containing a tuple with three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a). It returns a list of results, where each result is the count of pairs (i, j) in the list a such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and either (a_i + a_j) % x = 0 or (a_i - a_j) % y = 0. The input test_cases list remains unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the `results` list, which contains the count of pairs (i, j) for each test case, where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and (a_i + a_j) % x = 0 or (a_i - a_j) % y = 0. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
