Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly count the beautiful pairs as defined in the problem statement. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. Specifically, the way it updates and uses the `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries does not ensure that both conditions for a beautiful pair are met simultaneously.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_x_map = {}
        mod_y_map = {}
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (arr[i] + arr[j]) % x == 0 and (arr[i] - arr[j]) % y == 0:
                    count += 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

This corrected version iterates through all pairs of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) and checks both conditions for a beautiful pair directly. While this approach is straightforward and correct, it may not be efficient for large inputs due to its \(O(n^2)\) complexity. For better performance, a more optimized approach can be used, such as precomputing the necessary conditions and using a hash map to count the pairs efficiently.
