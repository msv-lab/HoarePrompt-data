Reasoning:

The program aims to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case, where a beautiful pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) satisfies the conditions:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program reads the input and processes it into a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array `a`. This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

The function `func_1` is responsible for counting the beautiful pairs. Here's a detailed analysis of the function:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `count` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.
   - `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are dictionaries to store the counts of remainders when elements of `a` are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each element `num` in `arr`, the program calculates:
     - `mod_x = -num % x`: This is the remainder when \(-num\) is divided by `x`.
     - `mod_y = num % y`: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - The program then increments `count` by the number of elements already seen that satisfy the conditions:
     - `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)`: This counts how many elements have a remainder \(-num % x\) when divided by `x`.
     - `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`: This counts how many elements have a remainder `num % y` when divided by `y`.
   - The program updates the dictionaries with the current element's remainders:
     - `mod_x_key = num % x`: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
     - `mod_y_key = num % y`: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
     - `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` and `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` are incremented.

3. **Output**:
   - The function appends the `count` to the `results` list for each test case.
   - The `results` list is returned and printed.

However, there is a critical issue in the logic of the program:
- The conditions for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful are:
  - \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\)
  - \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\)
- The current implementation incorrectly counts pairs where either condition is satisfied, but it should count pairs where both conditions are satisfied simultaneously.

To fix this, the program should check both conditions for each pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) and only increment the count if both conditions are met.

Given this reasoning, the current implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
