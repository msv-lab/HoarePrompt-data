Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly count the number of beautiful pairs as described in the problem. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed because it incorrectly uses the modulo operations to count pairs. Specifically, the program uses `mod_x = -num % x` and `mod_y = num % y` to count pairs, but this does not correctly handle the conditions for a pair to be beautiful.

For a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful, both conditions must be met:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

However, the current implementation only checks the modulo of individual elements, which does not ensure that the sum and difference of pairs meet the required conditions. 

For example, consider the test case:
```
n = 4, x = 3, y = 2, arr = [1, 2, 4, 5]
```
The pairs \(\langle 1, 4 \rangle\) and \(\langle 2, 5 \rangle\) should be beautiful:
- \(1 + 5 = 6\) (divisible by 3) and \(1 - 5 = -4\) (divisible by 2).
- \(2 + 4 = 6\) (divisible by 3) and \(2 - 4 = -2\) (divisible by 2).

However, the program will not correctly count these pairs because it does not check the sum and difference conditions directly. Instead, it relies on incorrect modulo operations and accumulates counts in a way that does not reflect the problem requirements.
