You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
        
    #State: The values of t, n, and a remain unchanged. The loop prints the difference between the number of elements in the list of tokens and the number of unique elements in the list of tokens for each even-indexed line from the input (excluding the first line).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the length of the list), and `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice). The function processes the list `a` for each test case and returns a result based on the properties of the list `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
