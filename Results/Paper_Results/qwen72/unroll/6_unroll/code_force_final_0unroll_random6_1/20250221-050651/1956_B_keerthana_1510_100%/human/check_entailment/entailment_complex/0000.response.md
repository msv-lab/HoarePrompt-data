Reasoning:

The provided function `func` aims to solve the card game problem by reading input from the standard input and processing it. However, the function's implementation does not correctly address the game's logic and requirements. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Input Reading and Processing**:
   - The function reads every second line starting from the third line (`[2::2]`) of the input. This is appropriate for reading the card values since the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent pair of lines contains `n` and the list of card values.
   - It splits each line into tokens, which are the card values in your hand.

2. **Logic for Calculating Points**:
   - The function calculates the difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens (`len(tokens) - len({*tokens})`).
   - This difference represents the number of duplicate card values in your hand, which is not the correct way to determine the maximum number of points you can get in the game.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The game involves both you and Nene taking turns, and Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
   - The correct approach should consider the optimal strategy for both players, which involves keeping track of the cards on the table and making decisions based on the current state of the game.

4. **Expected Output**:
   - The function should output the maximum number of points you can get, not the number of duplicates in your hand.

Given these points, the function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to account for the game's turn-based nature and the optimal strategies of both players.

Correctness: **False**
