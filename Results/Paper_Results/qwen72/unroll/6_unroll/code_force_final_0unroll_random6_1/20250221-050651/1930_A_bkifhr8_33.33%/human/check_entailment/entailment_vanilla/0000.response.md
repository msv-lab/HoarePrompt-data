### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and a list of `2n` integers.

2. **Logic for Each Test Case**:
   - The program initializes a variable `ans` to store the score for the current test case.
   - It reads the input line and splits it into a list of strings `lst`.
   - It then iterates `n * 2` times, which is incorrect because it should only iterate `n` times (once for each pair).
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the length of `lst` is not 2. If it is not, it adds the minimum of the first two elements to `ans` and removes them from the list.
   - If the length of `lst` is 2, it adds the minimum of the two elements to `ans` and breaks the loop.

3. **Issues**:
   - The loop condition `for i in range(n * 2)` is incorrect. It should be `for i in range(n)` because you only need to perform the move `n` times.
   - The removal of elements from the list is incorrect. The program uses `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`, which are not the correct indices to remove the first two elements. It should use `lst.pop(0)` and `lst.pop(0)` to remove the first two elements.
   - The program does not handle the case where the list is empty after removing elements, which can lead to an error.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the score, you should always pair the smallest elements together. This can be achieved by sorting the list and then summing the first `n` elements (since the first `n` elements will be the smallest and thus the minimum of each pair).
   - The correct logic would be to sort the list and then sum the first `n` elements.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        ans = sum(lst[:n])
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
- **Sorting the List**: For each test case, it reads the list of `2n` integers, converts it to a list of integers, and sorts it.
- **Summing the First `n` Elements**: It then sums the first `n` elements of the sorted list, which are the smallest elements.
- **Storing and Printing Results**: The result for each test case is stored in `ans_f` and printed at the end.

This approach ensures that the program correctly calculates the maximum possible score for each test case.
