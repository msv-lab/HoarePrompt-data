Reasoning:

The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it processes the list of integers. Specifically, the way it removes elements from the list `lst` is incorrect. The program attempts to remove elements using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`, which will not work as intended because the indices `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are always 0 and 2, respectively, regardless of the current state of the list. This means that the program will not correctly remove the elements it is supposed to, leading to incorrect results.

Additionally, the program does not sort the list of integers, which is crucial for maximizing the score. To achieve the maximum score, you should always pair the smallest available integers together. Sorting the list and then summing the first `n` elements (which will be the minimum values of each pair) is the correct approach.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
        
        # Sort the list to ensure we can always pick the smallest elements
        lst.sort()
        
        # Sum the first n elements, which are the minimum values of each pair
        ans = sum(lst[:n])
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
    
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

Given the logical flaw in the original program, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
