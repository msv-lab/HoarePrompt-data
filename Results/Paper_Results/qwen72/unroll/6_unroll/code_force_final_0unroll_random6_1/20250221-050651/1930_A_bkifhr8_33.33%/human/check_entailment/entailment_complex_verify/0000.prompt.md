You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

    #State: t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, a is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, ans_f is a list of t integers where each integer is the sum of the minimum values of pairs of integers from the input list a.
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
        
    #State: The loop prints each integer in the list `ans_f`, which contains the sums of the minimum values of pairs of integers from the input list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `ans_f` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). It then calculates the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers from the list and appends these sums to a list `ans_f`. Finally, it prints each integer in `ans_f`. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for selecting and removing the minimum values from the list. Specifically, the program always selects the first two elements of the list and removes them, which is not optimal for maximizing the score. Additionally, the way elements are removed from the list using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` is incorrect and will not work as intended.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2
1 3 2 4
```
The correct output should be `3` (by selecting pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4)), but the program will output `2` because it always selects the first two elements and removes them, leading to suboptimal results.

A correct approach would involve sorting the list and then summing the first `n` elements, as the minimum value of each pair will always be one of the smallest `n` elements in the sorted list.
