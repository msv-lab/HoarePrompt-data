Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. The logic in the program is flawed because it does not consider the optimal moves for Alice and Bob. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the game's score is determined by the first integer `i` that either appears exactly once or does not appear at all in the array `a`. This is not the correct approach to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c`. She should try to add the smallest possible integers to `c` that are not already in `c` and are available in `a`.
2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the array `c`. He should try to remove the smallest possible integers from `a` that are not already in `c`.

### Optimal Solution:
- **Step 1**: Count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`.
- **Step 2**: Determine the smallest integer `i` that does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once. This integer `i` will be the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for num in a:
            cnt[num] += 1
        
        mex = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 0:
                mex = i
                break
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                mex = i + 1
                break
        else:
            mex = N
        
        print(mex)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1**: We use a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`.
- **Step 2**: We iterate through the integers from 0 to `N-1` to find the smallest integer `i` that does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once. This integer `i` will be the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.
- **Step 3**: If all integers from 0 to `N-1` appear at least twice, the MEX will be `N`.

This approach ensures that both players play optimally, and the MEX of the array `c` is correctly determined.
