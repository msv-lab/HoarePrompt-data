The only objects in the loop head are the variables `tc` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `tc` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
- `a` is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5

We need to ensure that the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, `int(input())` must be at least 1, and `tc` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `tc` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
