Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob. Specifically, the logic for determining the MEX of the final array `c` is flawed. The program incorrectly counts the number of unique elements in the array `a` and prints the first index where the count of an element is 0 or the count of elements with a count of 1 is greater than or equal to 2. This does not accurately reflect the optimal play for both players.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
0 1 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- **Optimal Play:**
  - Alice picks 1 (array `a` becomes `[0, 1, 2]`, array `c` becomes `[1]`).
  - Bob picks 0 (array `a` becomes `[1, 2]`, array `c` remains `[1]`).
  - Alice picks 1 (array `a` becomes `[2]`, array `c` becomes `[1, 1]`).
  - Bob picks 2 (array `a` becomes `[]`, array `c` becomes `[1, 1]`).

  The final array `c` is `[1, 1]`, and its MEX is 0. However, this is not the optimal play. The optimal play should result in `c` being `[1, 0]` or `[1, 2]`, both of which have a MEX of 3.

- **Program's Output:**
  - The program counts the elements and finds that `cnt[0] = 1`, `cnt[1] = 2`, and `cnt[2] = 1`.
  - It then prints `2` because `cnt[2]` is 1 and `t` (the count of elements with a count of 1) is 2.

This counterexample demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob, leading to an incorrect final score. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
