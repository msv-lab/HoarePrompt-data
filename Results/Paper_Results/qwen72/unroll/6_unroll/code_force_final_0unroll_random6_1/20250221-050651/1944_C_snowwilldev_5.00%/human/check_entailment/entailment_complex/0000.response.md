### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `N` and the list `a` of `N` integers.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. This is a correct approach to keep track of how many times each integer appears.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in `c`.
   - Alice and Bob play optimally, which means Alice will try to maximize the MEX and Bob will try to minimize it.
   - The program iterates through the integers from 0 to `N-1` and checks the count of each integer in `a`:
     - If an integer `i` appears exactly once (`cnt[i] == 1`), Alice can pick it, and Bob will not pick it. This means `i` will be in `c`.
     - If an integer `i` does not appear at all (`cnt[i] == 0`), it will not be in `c`, and thus it will be the MEX.
     - The program increments a counter `t` for each integer `i` that appears exactly once. If `t` reaches 2, it means Alice and Bob can both pick one unique integer, and the next integer `i` that does not appear in `a` will be the MEX.
     - The program prints the first such integer `i` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `N` is 1 correctly. If `N` is 1, the only element in `a` will be picked by Alice, and the MEX will be 1.
   - The program also handles the case where all elements in `a` are unique. In this case, Alice will pick the smallest unique element, and Bob will pick the next smallest unique element, and so on, until the MEX is found.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the MEX for each test case, which is the correct output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, given that both players play optimally. The logic and the implementation are sound and handle all edge cases as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
