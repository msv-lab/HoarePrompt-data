Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not always produce the correct minimum penalty for splitting the array into two subsequences. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
2 4 1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
For the input array `[2, 4, 1, 3]`, the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is to place all elements in one subsequence, either `s` or `t`. For example, if we place all elements in `s`, then `s = [2, 4, 1, 3]` and `t = []`. The penalty `p(s)` is 0 because there are no indices `i` where `s[i] < s[i + 1]`. The penalty `p(t)` is also 0 because `t` is empty. Therefore, the total penalty is `0 + 0 = 0`.

However, the provided program splits the array in a way that results in a penalty of 2. Specifically, it might split the array into `s = [2, 1]` and `t = [4, 3]`, resulting in `p(s) = 1` and `p(t) = 1`, giving a total penalty of `1 + 1 = 2`.

This indicates that the program does not always find the optimal split to minimize the penalty, and thus it is incorrect.
