Reasoning:
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not always produce the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array into two subsequences. The program's logic for deciding which subsequence to append each element to is flawed. Specifically, the conditions used to decide whether to append to `a` or `b` do not ensure that the penalty is minimized.

Let's break down the program's logic and the provided counterexample:

### Program Logic:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `a` and `b` are initialized as empty lists.
   - `cp` is initialized to 0 (but not used in the program).

2. **Element Assignment:**
   - For each element in the input list `lit`, the program checks the last elements of `a` and `b` (denoted as `x` and `y` respectively).
   - If `x > y`, the program appends the element to `b` if `y >= lit[i]` or `lit[i] > x`, and to `a` otherwise.
   - If `x == y`, the element is always appended to `a`.
   - If `x < y`, the program appends the element to `a` if `x >= lit[i]` or `lit[i] > y`, and to `b` otherwise.

3. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The penalty `s` is calculated by counting the number of increasing pairs in both `a` and `b`.

### Counterexample Analysis:
For the input array `[2, 4, 1, 3]`:
- The program might split the array into `s = [2, 1]` and `t = [4, 3]`:
  - `a` starts as `[]`.
  - `b` starts as `[]`.
  - First element `2` is appended to `a` because both `a` and `b` are empty.
  - Second element `4` is appended to `b` because `x = 2` and `y = inf`, and `4 > 2`.
  - Third element `1` is appended to `a` because `x = 2` and `y = 4`, and `1 < 2`.
  - Fourth element `3` is appended to `b` because `x = 1` and `y = 4`, and `3 < 4`.

This results in:
- `a = [2, 1]` with `p(a) = 1` (since `2 > 1`).
- `b = [4, 3]` with `p(b) = 1` (since `4 > 3`).

Thus, the total penalty `s` is `1 + 1 = 2`.

However, the optimal split would be to place all elements in one subsequence, either `s` or `t`, resulting in a total penalty of `0`.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for splitting the array does not always ensure the minimum penalty. The conditions used to decide which subsequence to append each element to are not optimal and can lead to suboptimal splits, as demonstrated by the counterexample.

Final: **False**
