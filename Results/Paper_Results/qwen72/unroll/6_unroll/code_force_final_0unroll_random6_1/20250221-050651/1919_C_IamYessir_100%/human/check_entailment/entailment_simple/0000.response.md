### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the array and the array itself.

2. **Subsequence Splitting:**
   - The function initializes two empty lists `a` and `b` to store the subsequences.
   - It then iterates through each element of the input array `lit` and decides whether to append the element to `a` or `b` based on the current last elements of `a` and `b`.

3. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - After splitting the array into `a` and `b`, the function calculates the penalty for each subsequence by counting the number of increasing pairs.
   - The penalty for `a` is calculated by iterating through `a` and incrementing `s` whenever `a[i] > a[i-1]`.
   - Similarly, the penalty for `b` is calculated by iterating through `b` and incrementing `s` whenever `b[i] > b[i-1]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total penalty `s` for each test case.

5. **Logical Consistency:**
   - The conditions used to decide which subsequence to append the current element to are designed to minimize the number of increasing pairs.
   - However, the conditions are overly complex and may not always result in the optimal split. For example, the condition `if x > y` and the subsequent checks do not necessarily ensure that the penalty is minimized.

6. **Optimal Splitting:**
   - The optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is to ensure that no element in `s` is greater than any element in `t`. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then splitting it into two non-decreasing subsequences.
   - The current logic does not guarantee this optimal split, and it may lead to suboptimal results in some cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always produce the correct minimum penalty because the logic for splitting the array into subsequences is not optimal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
