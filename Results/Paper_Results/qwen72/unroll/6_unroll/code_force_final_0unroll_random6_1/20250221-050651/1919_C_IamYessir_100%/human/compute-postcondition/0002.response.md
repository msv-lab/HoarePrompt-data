The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases without explicitly accepting any arguments. Each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function processes each test case and returns the appropriate output based on the conditions provided for `n` and the list of integers.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns the result for each test case based on the values of `n` and the list of integers.**
