Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The total number of test cases t is given, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
