You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Counter Initialization**:
   - The program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of elements in the arrays.
   - `cb` is a counter for the sorted array `b`.
   - `ca` is a counter for the first `m` elements of the sorted array `a`.

3. **Initial Check**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the minimum values of the intersection of `ca` and `cb` using the `&` operator, which gives the intersection of the two counters.
   - If this sum is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans` by 1.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length `m` in array `a`.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window:
     - It checks if the count of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than the count of `a[r]` in `cb`. If so, it increments `sm` by 1.
     - It increments the count of `a[r]` in `ca`.
   - For each element `a[r - m]` removed from the window:
     - It checks if the count of `a[r - m]` in `ca` is less than or equal to the count of `a[r - m]` in `cb`. If so, it decrements `sm` by 1.
     - It decrements the count of `a[r - m]` in `ca`.
   - If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans` by 1.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of good subsegments for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Sliding Window Approach**:
  - The sliding window approach is correctly implemented to efficiently check each subsegment of length `m` in array `a`.
  - The program correctly updates the counters and the sum of matching elements as the window slides.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where `m` is equal to `n` (i.e., the entire array `a` is considered as a subsegment).
  - The program also handles the case where `k` is 1, which means any subsegment with at least one matching element is considered good.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The use of `Counter` and the sliding window approach ensures that the program runs efficiently within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subsegments of array `a` based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
