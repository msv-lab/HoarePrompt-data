Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same. `a` and `b` remain the same. `cb` remains the same. `ca` contains the frequency of each element in the sorted last `m` elements of list `a`. `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of the common elements between the last `m` elements of list `a` and list `b`. `ans` is the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` common elements with `b` in terms of frequency.**
