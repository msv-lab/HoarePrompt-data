### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and each string `s` for each test case.

2. **Set Creation:**
   - The program creates a set `a` to store unique characters from the string `s`. This is a good approach to check if the string has more than one unique character.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the length of the set `a` is greater than 1. If it is, it means the string `s` has more than one unique character, and it is possible to rearrange the string to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`.

4. **String Rearrangement:**
   - The program attempts to rearrange the string `s` in three different ways:
     - By splitting the string into two halves and swapping them.
     - By reversing the string.
     - By splitting the string into two halves and concatenating them in a different order.
   - The program then checks if any of these rearrangements result in a string that is not equal to the original string `s`.

5. **Output:**
   - If any of the rearrangements result in a string `r` that is not equal to `s`, the program prints "YES" followed by the rearranged string.
   - If the string `s` has only one unique character, the program prints "NO".

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the string `s` has only one unique character correctly by printing "NO".
   - The program also handles the case where the string `s` has more than one unique character and can be rearranged to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`.

### Correctness:
The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately. It correctly identifies when a string can be rearranged and provides a valid rearrangement when possible.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
