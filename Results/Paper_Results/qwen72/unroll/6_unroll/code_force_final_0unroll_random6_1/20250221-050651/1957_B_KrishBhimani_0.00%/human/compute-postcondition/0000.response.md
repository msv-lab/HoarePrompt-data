The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is used to discard the loop index.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is a positive integer, which will make the loop execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
