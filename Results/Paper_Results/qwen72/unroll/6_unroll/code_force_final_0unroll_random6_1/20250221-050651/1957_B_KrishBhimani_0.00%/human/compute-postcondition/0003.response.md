Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it generates a list `ans` of length `n` such that the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`. The elements in `ans` are powers of 2, and any remaining positions in the list are filled with zeros. The function prints the list `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state is that all test cases have been processed and their respective lists have been printed. **
