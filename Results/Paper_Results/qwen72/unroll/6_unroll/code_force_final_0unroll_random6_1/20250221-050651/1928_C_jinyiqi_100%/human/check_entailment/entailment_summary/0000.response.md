### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the number of natural numbers `k` such that the given position `n` and the number `x` Vasya received during the settling are consistent with the described pattern.
   - The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and the numbers assigned to positions follow a specific sequence.

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - For a given `k`, the sequence of numbers assigned to positions is:
     - First `k` positions: 1, 2, 3, ..., k
     - Next `k - 2` positions: k - 1, k - 2, ..., 2
     - This pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - Therefore, for a given position `n` and number `x`, we need to find all `k` such that:
     - `n` modulo `2k - 2` falls within the first `k` positions and equals `x`.
     - Or `n` modulo `2k - 2` falls within the next `k - 2` positions and equals `2k - 1 - x`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it checks two conditions:
     - If `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`, it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` and processes the divisors.
     - If `(n - x) % 2 == 0`, it calls `func_1(n - x)` and processes the divisors.
   - The function `func_1(x)` returns all divisors of `x` in a specific order (greater than or equal to the square root of `x` followed by those less than or equal to the square root in reverse order).

4. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of `x` and returns them in the specified order.
   - This is verified by the execution summary and the logic of the function.

5. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic of the program checks if `n + x - 2` and `n - x` are even, which is a necessary condition for the pattern to hold.
   - It then finds the divisors of these values using `func_1` and checks if they can form valid `k` values.
   - The condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` ensures that `s` is even, and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` ensures that the `k` value is valid.
   - The program collects all valid `k` values in a list `output` and removes duplicates using `set`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `k = 1` is not valid by ensuring `k > 1`.
   - The constraints `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9` are respected, and the program should work within these limits.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values for the given position `n` and number `x`. The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to find the divisors, and the main logic correctly processes these divisors to find valid `k` values.

**Correctness: True**
