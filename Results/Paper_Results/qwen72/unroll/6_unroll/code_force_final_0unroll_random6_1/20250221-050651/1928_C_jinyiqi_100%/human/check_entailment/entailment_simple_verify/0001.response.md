### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - This part of the program is accurate.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It iterates from 1 to the square root of `x` and checks if `x` is divisible by `i`.
   - If `x` is divisible by `i`, it appends both `i` and `x // i` to the lists `output1` and `output2`.
   - Finally, it reverses `output1` and concatenates it with `output2` to get all divisors in a single list.
   - This function is correct and efficiently finds all divisors of `x`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic of the program is to determine the possible values of `k` that fit the given constraints.
   - The program considers two cases:
     - **Case 1:** `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
     - **Case 2:** `(n - x) % 2 == 0`
   - For each case, it calls `func_1` to find the divisors of the respective value.
   - It then checks if each divisor `s` plus 2 is even and if `(s + 2) / 2` is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If both conditions are met, it appends `(s + 2) / 2` to the `output` list.
   - After processing both cases, it converts the `output` list to a set to remove duplicates and prints the length of the set.
   - This logic is generally sound, but we need to verify if it correctly identifies all possible `k` values that fit the given constraints.

4. **Constraints and Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraints \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).
   - It ensures that `k` is a natural number greater than 1 by checking if `(s + 2) / 2` is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - However, we need to ensure that the logic for determining `k` values is correct and complete.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints for each test case.
   - This part of the program is accurate.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Case 1: `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`**
  - This condition checks if the sum of `n + x - 2` is even.
  - If true, it means that `n + x - 2` can be expressed as `2 * m` for some integer `m`.
  - The program then finds the divisors of `2 * m` and checks if each divisor `s` plus 2 is even and if `(s + 2) / 2` is greater than or equal to `x`.
  - This is correct because if `s + 2` is even, then `(s + 2) / 2` is an integer, and it should be greater than or equal to `x` to be a valid `k`.

- **Case 2: `(n - x) % 2 == 0`**
  - This condition checks if the difference `n - x` is even.
  - If true, it means that `n - x` can be expressed as `2 * m` for some integer `m`.
  - The program then finds the divisors of `2 * m` and checks if each divisor `s` plus 2 is even and if `(s + 2) / 2` is greater than or equal to `x`.
  - This is correct for the same reasons as Case 1.

- **Combining Results:**
  - The program combines the results from both cases and removes duplicates by converting the list to a set.
  - This is a correct approach to ensure that each `k` value is counted only once.
