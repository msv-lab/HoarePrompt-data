### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem describes a specific pattern of numbering in a line, where the sequence repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - We need to determine how many different values of `k` (where `k > 1`) can fit the given position `n` and number `x`.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the position `n` and the number `x`.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - If `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`, it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` and processes the result.
     - If `(n - x) % 2 == 0`, it calls `func_1(n - x)` and processes the result.
   - The function `func_1` returns a list of all divisors of `x`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of `x` and returns them in a specific order.
   - It ensures that the divisors are returned in a list that combines all divisors greater than or equal to the square root of `x` with all divisors less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks if `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` are even.
   - For each even value, it calls `func_1` and processes the divisors to find valid `k` values.
   - It appends valid `k` values to the `output` list and then prints the length of the unique values in `output`.

5. **Correctness of the Main Logic**:
   - The main logic correctly identifies the conditions under which `k` can be valid.
   - It processes the divisors returned by `func_1` to ensure that `k` is a natural number greater than 1 and fits the given constraints.
   - The use of `set` to remove duplicates is appropriate.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as `k = 1` (which is not valid) and large values of `n` and `x` (up to `10^9`).

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem description accurately. It correctly identifies and processes the divisors to find valid `k` values and handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
