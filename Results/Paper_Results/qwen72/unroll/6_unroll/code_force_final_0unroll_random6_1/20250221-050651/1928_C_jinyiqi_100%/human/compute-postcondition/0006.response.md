The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`, where `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. The function returns a list that includes all divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x` (or equal if `x` is a perfect square) combined with all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) and returns a list containing all divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`, followed by all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order.**
