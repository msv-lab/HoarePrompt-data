### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a list of slimes with sizes `a`.
   - Each second, a slime can eat one of its neighbors if it is strictly larger than the neighbor.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, or report -1 if it is impossible.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is used to find the index of the smallest element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - It uses the `bisect_left` function to find the insertion point for `x` in the sorted list `a`.
   - If `x` is found in `a`, it returns the index of `x` plus 1.
   - If `x` is not found, it returns the index `inx` where `a[inx]` is the smallest element greater than `x`.
   - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes the list `a` to determine the minimum time each slime can be eaten.
   - It maintains two lists: `left` for cumulative sums and `last` for the last occurrence of each unique element.
   - For each slime `a[i]`, if it is smaller than its previous neighbor `a[i-1]`, it can be eaten in 1 second.
   - Otherwise, it calculates `x` as the cumulative sum up to `i` minus `a[i]` minus 1.
   - It then calls `func_1` to find the index `inx` of the smallest cumulative sum greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If `inx` is valid (non-negative and greater than or equal to the last occurrence of `a[i-1]`), it sets `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx`.
   - If `inx` is invalid, `ans[i]` remains -1.

4. **Main Program:**
   - The main program iterates over multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2` on the original list `a` and the reversed list `a[::-1]`.
   - It then combines the results from both directions to ensure the minimum time is considered.
   - If either direction results in -1, it takes the maximum of the two results (which will be -1 if one is -1).
   - Otherwise, it takes the minimum of the two results.

5. **Verification:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the smallest element greater than or equal to `x`.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes the list to determine the minimum time each slime can be eaten.
   - The main program correctly combines the results from both directions to ensure the minimum time is considered.
   - The logic for handling the cumulative sums and the last occurrence indices is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided in the comments. It correctly handles the conditions for each slime being eaten and combines the results from both directions to ensure the minimum time is considered.

Correctness: **True**
