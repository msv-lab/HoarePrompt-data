You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 3 * 10^5, and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a).
def func_2(a, n):
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
        
    #State: The list `last` will contain the indices of the last occurrence of each unique element in the list `a` up to the current index `i` for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`. The list `ans` will remain unchanged, with all elements set to -1.
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
        
    #State: The list `left` will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in the list `a` up to each index `i` for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`. The list `ans` will remain unchanged, with all elements set to -1.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
        
    #State: The list `left` will still contain the cumulative sum of the elements in the list `a` up to each index `i` for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`. The list `ans` will be updated such that for each index `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`, if `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` will be set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` will be set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)` and `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1`, but only if `inx` is non-negative and greater than or equal to `last[i - 1]`. If `inx` is negative or less than `last[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` will remain -1.
    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans` which has been updated based on the conditions specified. For each index `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`, if `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)` with `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1`, but only if `inx` is non-negative and greater than or equal to `last[i - 1]`. If `inx` is negative or less than `last[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` remains -1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` (for `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`) is set to 1 if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx` if `inx` (the result of `func_1(left, x)` with `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1`) is non-negative and greater than or equal to `last[i - 1]`. If `inx` is negative or less than `last[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` remains -1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `ans` which has been updated based on the conditions specified. For each index `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`, if `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)` with `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1`, but only if `inx` is non-negative and greater than or equal to `last[i - 1]`. If `inx` is negative or less than `last[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` remains -1.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
