Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is intended to find the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`. However, it does not handle the case where `x` is greater than all elements in `a` correctly. It should return `len(a)` if no such element exists, but it returns `-1`, which is incorrect.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The `left` array is supposed to store the cumulative sum of the sizes of the slimes up to each index. However, the way it is constructed (`left.append(left[-1] + i)`) is incorrect because it is adding the cumulative sum of the sizes of the slimes to the current size, which is not what is needed.
   - The `last` array is supposed to store the last index of the same size as the current slime, but it is not correctly handling the case where the current slime is different from the previous one.
   - The logic for determining the minimum number of seconds for a slime to be eaten is flawed. The program does not correctly simulate the process of slimes eating each other, and it does not consider all possible ways the process can go.

3. **Output**: The program does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem description. It only processes a single test case and does not read the number of test cases `t` from the input.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to:
- Simulate the process of slimes eating each other.
- Consider all possible ways the process can go.
- Handle multiple test cases.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_seconds_to_eaten(a, n):
    # Initialize the answer array with -1 (impossible to be eaten)
    ans = [-1] * n
    
    # Stack to keep track of the indices of slimes that can potentially eat others
    stack = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and a[stack[-1]] < a[i]:
            j = stack.pop()
            ans[j] = i - j
        stack.append(i)
    
    # Reverse the process to check from the right side
    stack = []
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and a[stack[-1]] < a[i]:
            j = stack.pop()
            if ans[j] == -1 or ans[j] > j - i:
                ans[j] = j - i
        stack.append(i)
    
    return ans

# Reading input and handling multiple test cases
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1

results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    results.append(min_seconds_to_eaten(a, n))

# Printing the results
for result in results:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

This corrected version uses a stack to efficiently determine the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten by another slime, considering both left and right neighbors. It also handles multiple test cases correctly.
