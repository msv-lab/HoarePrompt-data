The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop will execute because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. For the loop to execute, `i` must start at 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `left` will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in the list `a` up to each index `i` for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `ans` will remain unchanged, with all elements set to -1**
