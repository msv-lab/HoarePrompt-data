### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, or report `-1` if it is impossible.
   - Slimes can only eat their neighbors if they are strictly larger.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function is designed to find the index of the smallest element in the prefix sum array `left` that is greater than or equal to a given value `x`.
     - It uses `bisect_left` to find the insertion point of `x` in the sorted array `a`.
     - If `x` is found in `a`, it returns the index + 1.
     - Otherwise, it returns the index where `x` would be inserted.
     - This function is used to determine the earliest point where a slime can be eaten by a larger slime.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function processes the array of slime sizes `a` and returns an array `ans` where `ans[i]` is the minimum number of seconds it takes for the `i`-th slime to be eaten.
     - **Initialization**:
       - `left` is a prefix sum array that keeps track of the cumulative sum of slime sizes.
       - `last` is an array that keeps track of the last index of a slime with a different size than the current one.
       - `ans` is initialized to `-1` for all slimes, indicating that initially, we assume no slime can be eaten.
     - **Main Loop**:
       - For each slime `i`:
         - If `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, the `i`-th slime can be eaten by the `i-1`-th slime in 1 second, so `ans[i] = 1`.
         - Otherwise, it calculates `x` as the cumulative sum of sizes up to the `i`-th slime minus the size of the `i`-th slime minus 1.
         - It uses `func_1` to find the earliest index `inx` where the cumulative sum is at least `x`.
         - It also checks `last[i - 1]` to ensure that the slime at `i` can be eaten by a slime that is not of the same size.
         - If `inx` is valid, it updates `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx`.

3. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - **Prefix Sum Array (`left`)**:
     - The prefix sum array `left` is correctly built, ensuring that `left[i]` contains the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - **Last Different Slime Array (`last`)**:
     - The `last` array is correctly built to keep track of the last index of a slime with a different size than the current one.
   - **Main Loop**:
     - The loop correctly checks if a slime can be eaten by its left neighbor in 1 second.
     - The calculation of `x` and the use of `func_1` to find the earliest index `inx` where the cumulative sum is at least `x` is logical.
     - The check `if inx2 < inx` ensures that the slime can only be eaten by a different-sized slime.
     - The update `ans[i] = i + 1 - inx` correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds for the slime to be eaten.

4. **Final Processing**:
   - The program processes the array `a` from both directions (left to right and right to left) to ensure that the minimum number of seconds is calculated correctly.
   - The final loop combines the results from both directions, taking the minimum of the two values if both are non-negative, or the maximum if one is `-1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where a slime cannot be eaten by any other slime, returning `-1` for such slimes.
   - It also handles the case where a slime can be eaten by its neighbor in 1 second.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The logic for calculating the minimum number of seconds and handling edge cases is sound and efficient.

Final: **True**
