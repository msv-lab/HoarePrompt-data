The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in the list `a` during the first iteration.

State: **`last` is a list that will contain the indices of the last occurrence of each unique element in the list `a` up to the current index `i` for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `ans` is a list of -1s, `a` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `a`**
