The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `x` (1 <= x <= 10^9). It returns -1 if `x` is less than 0. If `x` is found in the list `a`, it returns the index of `x` plus 1. If `x` is not found in `a`, it returns the index `inx` returned by the function `bl(a, x)`, where `a[inx]` is not equal to `x`.
