### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, or to report -1 if it is impossible. The provided program uses a combination of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to achieve this.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used to find the index of the smallest element in the prefix sum array `left` that is greater than or equal to a given value `x`.
   - It uses the `bisect_left` function to find the insertion point of `x` in the sorted list `a`.
   - If `x` is found in `a`, it returns the index of `x` plus 1.
   - If `x` is not found, it returns the index `inx` where `a[inx]` is the smallest element greater than `x`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten from the left.
   - It maintains two lists: `left` for the prefix sums of the sizes of slimes and `last` for the last occurrence index of the previous slime's size.
   - For each slime, if it is smaller than its left neighbor, it is immediately eaten, and the time is set to 1.
   - If it is not smaller, it calculates the time it would take for the slime to be eaten by a larger slime to its left using the prefix sum and the `func_1` function.
   - The result is stored in the `ans` list.

3. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten from both directions (left and right) using `func_2`.
   - It then combines the results from both directions to get the minimum time for each slime to be eaten in any direction.
   - If a slime cannot be eaten from either direction, it sets the time to -1.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
  - The `left` list is correctly used to store the prefix sums of the slime sizes.
  - This helps in efficiently calculating the total size of slimes to the left of a given slime.

- **Last Occurrence Index**:
  - The `last` list is used to store the last occurrence index of the previous slime's size.
  - This helps in ensuring that the slime being considered is not eaten by a smaller slime that has already been eaten.

- **Time Calculation**:
  - The program correctly identifies slimes that are immediately eaten by their left neighbors.
  - For slimes that are not immediately eaten, it uses the prefix sum and the `func_1` function to find the minimum time it would take for a larger slime to eat the current slime.
  - The results from both directions are combined to get the final answer.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where a slime cannot be eaten by setting the time to -1.
  - It also correctly handles the case where the slime is immediately eaten by its left neighbor.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The use of prefix sums and binary search (via `bisect_left`) ensures that the program is efficient and can handle the constraints provided in the problem.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the edge cases and efficiently calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten. Therefore, the program is correct.
