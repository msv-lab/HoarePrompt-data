You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

- Program:
from bisect import bisect_left as bl
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, x):
    if x < 0:
        return -1
    inx = bl(a, x)
    if a[inx] == x:
        return inx + 1
    return inx

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, n):
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of the same length as `a`, where each element `ans[i]` (for `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`) is set to 1 if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)` with `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1`, but only if `inx` is non-negative and greater than or equal to the last occurrence index of `a[i-1]` (stored in `last[i - 1]`). If `inx` is negative or less than `last[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` remains -1. The first element of `ans` is always -1.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where a slime can eat its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. Specifically, the program fails to account for the dynamic nature of the slime sizes as they change over time due to eating their neighbors. The program only considers the initial state of the slimes and does not simulate the process of slimes eating each other over time, which is crucial for determining the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.

A specific example where the program fails:
- Input: `n = 5`, `a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4]`
- Expected Output: `2 1 2 1 2`
- Actual Output: `2 1 2 1 -1`

In this example, the program incorrectly reports that the 5th slime cannot be eaten, whereas it can be eaten by the 3rd slime after the 3rd slime eats the 4th slime. The correct output should be `2 1 2 1 2` instead of `2 1 2 1 -1`.
