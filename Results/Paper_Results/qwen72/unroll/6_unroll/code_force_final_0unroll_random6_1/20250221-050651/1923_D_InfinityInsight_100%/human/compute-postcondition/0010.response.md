The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `n`. `a` is a list of integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 3 * 10^5, and each element in the list is between 1 and 10^9. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a).

The function returns a list `ans` that is updated based on the following conditions:
- For each index `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`:
  - If `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, then `ans[i]` is set to 1.
  - Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)` with `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1`, provided that `inx` is non-negative and greater than or equal to `last[i - 1]`.
  - If `inx` is negative or less than `last[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` remains -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` (for `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`) is set to 1 if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx` if `inx` (the result of `func_1(left, x)` with `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1`) is non-negative and greater than or equal to `last[i - 1]`. If `inx` is negative or less than `last[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` remains -1.**
