You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

        print(max(0, ans))
        
    #State: The loop processes each test case, and for each test case, it prints the maximum of 0 and the calculated value of `ans`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are reset for each test case, and the final state of these variables is undefined after the loop completes. The variables `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` are only relevant within each test case and are recalculated for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has elements that are not equal at the boundaries but can be made equal with a smaller cost than the current logic suggests. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1]`. The correct answer should be `3` (by setting the elements from index 1 to 3 to 1), but the program will output `4` because it incorrectly calculates the cost as `r - l` without considering the optimal subarray to set to a common value.

The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks for consecutive equal elements at the boundaries and does not consider the possibility of finding a common value within the array that can be used to make all elements equal with a lower cost. This leads to incorrect results for certain test cases.
