Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints the maximum of 0 and a value `ans`, which represents the length of the longest subarray of `a` that does not contain consecutive duplicate elements, adjusted based on the presence of duplicates at the start and end of the list. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the state of the variables `t`, `n`, and `a` is undefined. **
