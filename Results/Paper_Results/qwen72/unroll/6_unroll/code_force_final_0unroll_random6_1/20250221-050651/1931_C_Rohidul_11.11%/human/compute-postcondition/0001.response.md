Output State: **The loop processes each test case, and for each test case, it prints the maximum of 0 and the calculated value of `ans`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are reset for each test case, and the final state of these variables is undefined after the loop completes. The variables `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` are only relevant within each test case and are recalculated for each iteration.**
