You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        l, r = 0, n - 1
        
        st, end = 0, 0
        
        while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
            l += 1
            st += 1
        
        while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
            r -= 1
            end += 1
        
        if a[0] == a[-1]:
            ans = r - l - 1
        elif st == 0 and end == 0 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            ans = len(a) - 1
        else:
            ans = r - l
        
        print(max(0, ans))
        
    #State: The loop processes each test case, and for each test case, it prints the maximum of 0 and the calculated value of `ans`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are reset for each test case, and the final state of these variables is undefined after the loop completes. The variables `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` are only relevant within each test case and are recalculated for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (length of the list), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It processes the list `a` for each test case and returns a result based on the elements of `a` and the constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
