Output State: **The loop will print the minimum of the squared distances between the corresponding corners of the two squares for each test case. The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop, and `n` and `x` will retain their final computed values from the last iteration. The number of test cases `t` will remain unchanged.**
