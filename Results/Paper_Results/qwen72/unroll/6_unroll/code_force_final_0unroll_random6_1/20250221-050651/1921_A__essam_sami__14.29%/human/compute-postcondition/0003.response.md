The function `func` accepts a list of test cases. Each test case is a list of four tuples, with each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and the square has a positive area with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates whether the given coordinates form a valid square with the specified properties.
