Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the coordinates of the corners of the square one by one for each test case. This is correct, but the coordinates are not stored in a way that allows for easy manipulation or verification that they form a square.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates two squared distances, `n` and `x`, between pairs of points. However, these distances are not necessarily the side lengths of the square. The program assumes that the minimum of these two distances is the side length of the square, which is incorrect. The side length of the square should be the distance between any two adjacent corners.

3. **Logic Error**: The program does not check if the given points form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It simply calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points and prints the minimum of these distances. This approach will not always yield the correct area of the square.

4. **Correct Approach**: To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
   - Read the coordinates of the four corners.
   - Identify the side length of the square by finding the minimum distance between any two adjacent corners.
   - Calculate the area of the square as the side length squared.

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
