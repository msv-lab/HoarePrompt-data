You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

        else:
            print(x)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases from the user input, where each test case consists of the coordinates of the corners of two squares. For each test case, it calculates the squared distances between the corresponding corners of the two squares and prints the minimum of these squared distances. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the number of test cases `t` remains unchanged, and the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `n`, and `x` retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given the coordinates of the four corners of a square.
   - The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
   - We need to calculate the area of the square.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square.

3. **Calculating the Area:**
   - The area of a square can be determined by the distance between any two adjacent corners.
   - Since the sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the distance between two adjacent corners is either the difference in the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates.
   - The program calculates two distances:
     - `n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`
     - `x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`
   - These distances are squared distances between two points, but since the sides are parallel to the axes, the squared distance should be the sum of the squares of the differences in x and y coordinates.
   - However, for a square with sides parallel to the axes, the squared distance between two adjacent corners should be the square of the side length.

4. **Checking the Distances:**
   - The program compares `n` and `x` and prints the smaller one.
   - This approach is incorrect because the distances `n` and `x` are not necessarily the distances between adjacent corners. They could be the distances between any two points, which might not be the side length of the square.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the side length of the square, we should calculate the differences in x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately.
   - The side length of the square is the maximum of the absolute differences in x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
   - The area of the square is the square of this side length.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. It uses an incorrect method to determine the side length by comparing squared distances between arbitrary points, which may not be the side length of the square.
