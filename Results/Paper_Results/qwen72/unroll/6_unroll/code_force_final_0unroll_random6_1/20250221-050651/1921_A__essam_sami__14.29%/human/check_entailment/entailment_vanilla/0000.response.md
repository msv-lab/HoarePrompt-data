### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square.

2. **Coordinate Calculation**:
   - The program calculates two distances `n` and `x` using the Euclidean distance formula squared (i.e., without taking the square root).
   - The distances are calculated between pairs of points: `(a, b)` and `(e, f)` for `n`, and `(c, d)` and `(g, h)` for `x`.

3. **Distance Comparison**:
   - The program compares the two calculated distances `n` and `x`.
   - It prints the smaller of the two distances.

4. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The problem states that the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and the coordinates of the corners are given in random order.
   - For a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the distance between any two adjacent corners (i.e., the side length of the square) will be the same.
   - The program should calculate the side length of the square and then print the area, which is the side length squared.
   - However, the program does not correctly identify the side length of the square. It calculates the distance between two arbitrary pairs of points and prints the smaller one, which is not guaranteed to be the side length of the square.

5. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program assumes that the distance between two pairs of points will give the side length of the square, but this is not always true.
   - For example, if the points are `(1, 2)`, `(4, 5)`, `(1, 5)`, and `(4, 2)`, the distance between `(1, 2)` and `(4, 5)` is not the side length of the square, but the distance between `(1, 2)` and `(1, 5)` or `(4, 2)` and `(4, 5)` is the side length.
   - The program should instead find the minimum difference between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the given points, and then use the larger of these two differences as the side length of the square.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly identify the side length of the square and thus does not compute the correct area. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
