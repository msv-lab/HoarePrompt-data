The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. It also accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains four elements: (n, k, a, x). Here, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the number of monsters. `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second. `a` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9, representing the health of each monster. `x` is a list of `n` integers, each between -n and n, representing the initial positions of the monsters, with the constraint that x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n and x_i ≠ 0. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines the minimum time required to defeat all the monsters, given the constraints on the number of bullets that can be fired per second and the health and positions of the monsters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains four elements: (n, k, a, x), where `n` is the number of monsters, `k` is the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second, `a` is a list of the health of each monster, and `x` is a list of the initial positions of the monsters. The function returns a list of results, where each result is the minimum time required to defeat all the monsters for the corresponding test case.**
