The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length. Additionally, the function handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. The function returns different outputs based on the values of `x` and `y` for each test case.
