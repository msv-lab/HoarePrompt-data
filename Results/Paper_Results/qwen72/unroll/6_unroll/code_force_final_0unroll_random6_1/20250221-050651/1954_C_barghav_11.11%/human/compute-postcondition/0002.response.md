The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `a`. If `a` has at least one character, the loop will execute. For the loop to be executed, `a` must have at least one character, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `i` is 0**
