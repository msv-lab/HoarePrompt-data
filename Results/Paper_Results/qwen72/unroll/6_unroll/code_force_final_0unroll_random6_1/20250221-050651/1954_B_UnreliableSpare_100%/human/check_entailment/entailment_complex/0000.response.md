Reasoning:

The program provided is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function Call and Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. However, the function `func_1` itself does not take any parameters, which means it cannot directly handle the input for each test case. The function should be modified to accept `n` and `arr` as parameters.

2. **Consecutive Elements Check**: The program checks if all elements in the array are equal using a flag. If all elements are the same, the array is beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, so the program correctly prints `-1`.

3. **Minimum Consecutive Elements Calculation**: The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements equal to the first element of the array (`arr[0]`). However, this approach is incorrect because it only considers consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` and does not account for other elements that could also be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

4. **Handling Beautiful Arrays**: The problem requires that we make the array non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements. The current approach does not correctly handle the general case where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will output `1`, which is correct, but it does not consider the possibility of removing elements that are not equal to `arr[0]`.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if the array has only one element, it should print `-1` because a single-element array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

Given these issues, the program is **incorrect** for the following reasons:

- It does not correctly handle the input for multiple test cases.
- It does not consider all possible elements for removal, only those equal to the first element.
- It does not handle edge cases where the array has only one element.

Correctness: **False**
