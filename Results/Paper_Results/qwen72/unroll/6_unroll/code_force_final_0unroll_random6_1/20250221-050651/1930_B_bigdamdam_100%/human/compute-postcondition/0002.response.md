The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves a single integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the permutation. The total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and the sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function returns the result for each test case based on the input `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with a single integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of a permutation. It returns the result for each test case, ensuring that the total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and the sum of all `n` values does not exceed 10^5.**
