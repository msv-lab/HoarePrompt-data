### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Permutation Generation:**
   - The function initializes a list `p` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the list `p` in a specific pattern:
     - First, it fills the even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) with the largest remaining numbers in descending order.
     - Then, it fills the odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) with the smallest remaining numbers in ascending order.
   - This pattern ensures that no two adjacent elements in the permutation can both divide another pair of adjacent elements, which satisfies the problem's constraints.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the generated permutation for each test case, which is the required output format.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the minimum value of `n` (3) correctly, as shown in the example.
   - The function also handles larger values of `n` (up to 10^5) correctly by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining numbers.

5. **Constraints:**
   - The function ensures that the sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 10^5, as required by the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly generates and prints a valid permutation for each test case, adhering to the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
