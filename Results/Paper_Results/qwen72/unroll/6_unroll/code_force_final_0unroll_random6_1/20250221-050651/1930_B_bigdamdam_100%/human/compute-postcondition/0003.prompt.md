You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the permutation. The total number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and the sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        
        p = [0] * n
        
        ind = n
        
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: The function will have processed all test cases, and for each test case, it will have generated and printed a permutation of length n, where the permutation alternates between the largest and smallest remaining numbers, starting with the largest. The variables `i` and `ind` will have their final values after the last iteration of the loop, but these values are not significant as they are local to the loop. The total number of test cases `t` will remain unchanged, and the sum of all `n` values across test cases will also remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each with a single integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of a permutation. It returns the result for each test case, ensuring that the total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and the sum of all `n` values does not exceed 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
