Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads two integers `t` and `n`, and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. It calculates the adjusted Hamming distance between `s1` and `s2` by first computing the difference in the number of '1' characters between the two strings. Then, it iterates through the strings, adjusting the distance based on specific conditions. Finally, it prints the adjusted Hamming distance for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, and `s2` for each test case are unchanged after the function completes. **
