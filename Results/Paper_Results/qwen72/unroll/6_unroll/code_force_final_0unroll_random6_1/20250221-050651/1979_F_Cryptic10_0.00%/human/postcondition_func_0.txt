The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `d`, which is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to n-1, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. It prints a query string in the format `? d` to the standard output and then reads two integers `v` and `u` from the user input. The function returns these two integers `v` and `u`.
