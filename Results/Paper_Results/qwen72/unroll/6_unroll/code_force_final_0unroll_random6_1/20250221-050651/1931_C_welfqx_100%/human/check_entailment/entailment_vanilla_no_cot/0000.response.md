Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the case where all elements are already equal (output is `0`). However, it does not handle all other cases correctly.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cost**: The program attempts to find the longest prefix and suffix of the array that are equal and then calculates the cost as `n - max(cn, ck)`. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of making all elements equal by selecting a value that appears frequently in the array and applying the operation to the entire array.

3. **Optimal Solution**: The optimal solution should consider the following:
   - If all elements are already equal, the cost is `0`.
   - If the array has a single element, the cost is `0`.
   - Otherwise, the minimum cost to make all elements equal is the length of the array minus the length of the longest contiguous segment of the same value.

### Correct Approach:
To find the minimum cost, you should:
1. Check if all elements are already equal.
2. If not, find the length of the longest contiguous segment of the same value.
3. The minimum cost is the length of the array minus the length of this segment.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for r in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
        
        if n == 1 or all(num[0] == x for x in num):
            print(0)
            continue
        
        max_segment_length = 1
        current_segment_length = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if num[i] == num[i - 1]:
                current_segment_length += 1
            else:
                max_segment_length = max(max_segment_length, current_segment_length)
                current_segment_length = 1
        
        max_segment_length = max(max_segment_length, current_segment_length)
        
        print(n - max_segment_length)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. **Initial Check**: It checks if the array has only one element or if all elements are already equal. If so, it prints `0`.
3. **Finding Longest Segment**: It iterates through the array to find the length of the longest contiguous segment of the same value.
4. **Calculating Minimum Cost**: The minimum cost is the length of the array minus the length of the longest segment.

This approach ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum cost for all test cases.
