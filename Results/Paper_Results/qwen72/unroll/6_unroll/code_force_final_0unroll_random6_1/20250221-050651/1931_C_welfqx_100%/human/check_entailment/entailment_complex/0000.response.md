Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum cost (in burles) to make all elements of an array equal by applying a single operation that sets elements from index `i` to `j` to a value `x`, with the cost being `j - i + 1`.

However, the provided program does not solve this problem. Instead, it calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array a palindrome, which is a different problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `num`.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The program checks if the array is already a palindrome or if it has only one element. If so, it prints 0, which is correct for the palindrome problem but not for the problem of making all elements equal.

3. **Palindrome Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the length of the longest prefix and suffix that are palindromic.
   - It then prints `n - max(cn, ck)`, which is the number of elements that need to be removed to make the array a palindrome.

4. **Output**:
   - The output is correct for the palindrome problem but not for the problem of making all elements equal.

To solve the problem of making all elements equal, the program should:
- Determine the most frequent element in the array.
- Calculate the cost of setting all elements to this most frequent element.
- If the most frequent element is not the only element, consider the cost of setting all elements to a single value, which would be `n - 1` burles.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect for the specified problem.

Correctness: **False**
