The function `func_2` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` and `q` are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5.
- `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains two integers `b` and `x`. Here, `b` is in {1, 2}, and if `b` is 2, then 1 <= `x` <= 10^9.
- `queries` is a list of `q` integers `k_i`, where each `k_i` is such that 1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c), and `c` is the size of the array after all operations have been applied.

The function processes the operations and then answers the queries based on the resulting array. The exact output for each query is not specified, but it is implied that the function returns a list of results corresponding to each query.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries`. It processes a series of operations on an array and then returns a list of results based on the queries provided.**
