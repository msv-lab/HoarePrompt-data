Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, and operations is a list of n lists where each inner list contains two integers b and x, with b in {1, 2} and 1 <= x <= 10^9 for b=2, and queries is a list of q integers k_i such that 1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c), where c is the size of the array after all operations.**
