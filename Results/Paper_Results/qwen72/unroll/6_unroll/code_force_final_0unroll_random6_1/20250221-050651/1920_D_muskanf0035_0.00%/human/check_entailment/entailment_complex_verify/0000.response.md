Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program indeed does not handle the second type of operation correctly. According to the problem description, when the operation type is 2 and the value is x, the program should append x copies of the current array to the end of the array. However, the current implementation in `func_1` only appends one copy of the array, regardless of the value of x. This is evident from the line:

```python
array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
```

This line extends the array by one copy of itself, which is incorrect for x > 1. To fix this, the line should be modified to append x copies of the array:

```python
array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))] * value)
```

This change ensures that the array is extended by x copies of itself, as required by the problem description.

Given the incorrect handling of the second type of operation, the program will produce incorrect results for any test case where the second type of operation is used with x > 1. The example provided in the original assessment clearly demonstrates this issue.

Final: **False**
