The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the number of ways to choose 2 or 3 sticks of the same length for each test case. Each test case consists of a list of integers representing the exponents of stick lengths (2^{a_i}), and the function outputs the results for each test case on a new line. The function does not return any value.
