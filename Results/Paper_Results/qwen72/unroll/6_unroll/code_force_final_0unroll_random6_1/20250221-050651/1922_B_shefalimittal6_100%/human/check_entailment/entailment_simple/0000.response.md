### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input in a loop for each test case, correctly parsing the number of test cases `t` and the number of sticks `n` for each test case.

2. **Frequency Counting**:
   - The program initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` to count the frequency of each exponent `a_i`.
   - It correctly iterates through the input for each test case and updates the frequency list `v`.

3. **Triangle Formation**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle using the sticks.
   - It uses the fact that for a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.
   - The program correctly handles the cases where:
     - There are at least 2 sticks of the same length.
     - There are at least 3 sticks of the same length.
   - It uses combinatorial formulas to count the number of ways to choose 2 or 3 sticks of the same length.

4. **Output**:
   - The program appends the result for each test case to the `results` list.
   - It then prints the results, each on a new line, which matches the expected output format.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle the input, process the frequency of stick lengths, and calculate the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles. The logic and the combinatorial calculations are appropriate for the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
