Output State: **The function is now able to read input from the standard input (stdin). `a` is a list of integers representing the exponents of the stick lengths (2^{a_i}), `n` is an integer representing the number of sticks (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 and 0 \le a_i \le n), `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 \le t \le 10^4). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5. `data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces. `idx` is 2, `t` is equal to `int(data[0])`.**
