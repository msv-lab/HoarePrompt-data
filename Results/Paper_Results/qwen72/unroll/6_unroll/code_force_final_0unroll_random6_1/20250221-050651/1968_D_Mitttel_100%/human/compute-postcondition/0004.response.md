To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `not vis[s]` and `k > 0`.

1. **Condition `k > 0`:**
   - The state before the loop indicates that `k` is a positive integer where \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 \). This condition is already satisfied, so no adjustment is needed for `k`.

2. **Condition `not vis[s]`:**
   - The state before the loop indicates that `vis` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0. This means `vis` is initially a list of zeros.
   - `s` is a list of two integers `[P_B, P_S]` where \( 1 \leq P_B, P_S \leq n \).
   - For the loop to execute, `vis[s]` must be `False` (i.e., `vis[s[0]]` and `vis[s[1]]` must both be 0).

Given that `vis` is initialized with all elements set to 0, `vis[s]` will be `False` initially. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `vis[s]`.

Since both conditions are already satisfied, the program state does not need to be modified.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \), `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `s` is a list of two integers [P_B, P_S] where \( 1 \leq P_B, P_S \leq n \), `k` is a positive integer where \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 \), `n` is the length of `p`, and the length of `a` and `p` is `n`, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \), `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `vis` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0.**
