Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem based on the given constraints and examples. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` (number of coins Alice has) and `k` (number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: If `n == k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This is because Alice will spend all her `n` coins on `k` jewels, and since `n == k`, she will buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - **Case 2**: If `n + 2 > k * 2`, this condition ensures that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up two stalls. The first stall has a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel, and the second stall has a price of 1 coin per jewel. This works because:
     - Alice will buy `1` jewel from the first stall, spending `n - k + 1` coins, and will be left with `k - 1` coins.
     - Alice will then buy `k - 1` jewels from the second stall, spending `k - 1` coins, and will be left with 0 coins.
     - Thus, Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in total.
   - **Case 3**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it is impossible for Bob to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

3. **Output**: The program prints the correct output format for each test case, including the "YES" or "NO" response, the number of stalls, and the prices for the stalls when applicable.

The program handles all the given test cases correctly and adheres to the constraints and requirements of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
