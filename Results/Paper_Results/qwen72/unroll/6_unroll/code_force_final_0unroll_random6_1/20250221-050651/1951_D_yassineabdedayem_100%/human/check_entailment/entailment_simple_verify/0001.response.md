### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

2. **Case 1: `n == k`**
   - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - The program correctly prints "YES" and the pricing scheme as `1` (one stall with price 1).

3. **Case 2: `n + 2 > k * 2`**
   - This condition can be rewritten as `n > 2 * k - 2`.
   - If this condition is true, it means Alice has enough coins to buy `k` jewels by setting up two stalls: one with a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel and another with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - The first stall will allow Alice to buy `k - 1` jewels (since `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1) = n - (n - k + 1) + 1 = k`), and the second stall will allow her to buy the remaining 1 jewel.
   - The program correctly prints "YES" and the pricing scheme as `n - k + 1` and `1`.

4. **Case 3: `n + 2 <= k * 2`**
   - If the condition `n + 2 <= k * 2` is true, it means Alice does not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels even if she buys from the cheapest possible stalls.
   - The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n == k` by setting up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - The program also handles the case where `n` is just slightly more than `k` by setting up two stalls with appropriate prices.

6. **General Correctness:**
   - The logic in the program ensures that if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels, the program will print "YES" and a valid pricing scheme.
   - If Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels, the program will print "NO".

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **State of the Program Before the Function Call:**
  - `t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 1000\).
  - For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers where \(1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}\).

- **Inside the Function:**
  - The program reads `t` and iterates over each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` from the input.

- **Condition 1: `n == k`**
  - If `n` equals `k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
  - The program prints "YES", `1`, and `1`, which is correct.

- **Condition 2: `n + 2 > k * 2`**
  - This condition checks if Alice has enough coins to buy `k` jewels by setting up two stalls.
  - If `n > 2 * k - 2`, Alice can buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall.
  - The program prints "YES", `2`, and `n - k + 1 1`, which is correct.

- **Condition 3: `n + 2 <= k * 2`**
  - If `n` is not sufficient to buy `k` jewels even with the cheapest possible stalls, the program prints "NO".
  - This condition is correct because if `n <= 2 * k - 2`, Alice cannot buy `k` jewels.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines whether Bob can set up the stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, and it provides a valid pricing scheme when possible. The original assessment is accurate.
