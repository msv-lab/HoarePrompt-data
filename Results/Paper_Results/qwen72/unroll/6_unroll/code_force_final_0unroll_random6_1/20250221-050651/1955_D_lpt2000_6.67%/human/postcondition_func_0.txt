The function `func` reads an integer `nabors` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` and two lists of integers `aa` and `bb` from the input. It then calculates the number of times a condition is met: the condition is that at least `k` elements from the first `m` elements of `aa` are also present in `bb`. This calculation is performed by sliding a window of size `m` over `aa` and updating the counts of common elements between `aa` and `bb`. The function prints the number of times this condition is met for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value.
