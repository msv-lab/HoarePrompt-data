Output State: **The function `func` will print the integer value of `ans` for each test case after the loop has finished executing all iterations. The value of `ans` is calculated based on the inputs `n` and `m` for each test case, and the loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The variables `n`, `m`, `count`, `countmins`, and `g` are updated within the loop for each test case, but their final values are not retained between test cases.**
