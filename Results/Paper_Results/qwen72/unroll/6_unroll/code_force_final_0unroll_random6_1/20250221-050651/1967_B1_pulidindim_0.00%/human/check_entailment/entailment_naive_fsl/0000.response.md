Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the calculation of the number of valid pairs for the given conditions. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of valid pairs is flawed. For example, consider the input `n = 3` and `m = 5`. According to the problem description, the valid pairs should be `(1,1)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,2)`, `(3,1)`, and `(3,3)`, which totals 5 pairs. However, the program outputs 4, which is incorrect.

To further illustrate, let's break down the logic:
- The program initializes `ans` with `n`, which is not always correct.
- The loop that increments `count` and calculates `g` and `ans` does not accurately count the pairs that satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

A correct implementation would need to properly count the pairs by iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking the condition for each pair. The current implementation does not do this correctly.
