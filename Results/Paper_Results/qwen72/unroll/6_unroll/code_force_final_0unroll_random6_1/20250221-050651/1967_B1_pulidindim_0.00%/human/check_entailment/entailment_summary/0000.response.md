Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`.

3. **Loop**:
   - The loop runs while `count` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
     - `g` is calculated as `n / count`.
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
     - `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1`.
     - `count` is incremented by 1.

4. **Output**:
   - The final value of `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Initial Value of `ans`**:
  - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This is correct because for \(b = 1\), \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\) and \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot 1\). Therefore, all pairs \((a, 1)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) are valid, contributing `n` valid pairs.

- **Loop Logic**:
  - The loop starts from `count = 2` and iterates up to `m`.
  - For each `count` (which represents `b`), the program calculates `g` as `n / count`.
  - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
  - The condition `g < countmins` is used to break the loop. This is intended to ensure that the loop stops when there are no more valid pairs for the current `b`.
  - The adjustment `g -= countmins` is made to `g`.
  - The update `ans += g / count + 1` is intended to count the valid pairs for the current `b`.

### Issues in the Logic:

- **Calculation of `g`**:
  - The variable `g` is calculated as `n / count`, which is a floating-point division. This is not appropriate for counting integer pairs. It should be an integer division (`n // count`).

- **Adjustment of `g`**:
  - The adjustment `g -= countmins` is not clear and does not seem to align with the problem's requirements. The correct approach would be to count the valid pairs directly.

- **Update of `ans`**:
  - The update `ans += g / count + 1` is also problematic. The division `g / count` should be an integer division, and the logic for adding valid pairs needs to be more precise.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m` and count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each `b`. The key is to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:

The provided program has logical issues and does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
