You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two positive integers `n` and `m` as inputs, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function should handle multiple test cases, with the number of test cases `t` satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^4. It is guaranteed that the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: The function `func` will print the integer value of `ans` for each test case after the loop has finished executing all iterations. The value of `ans` is calculated based on the inputs `n` and `m` for each test case, and the loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The variables `n`, `m`, `count`, `countmins`, and `g` are updated within the loop for each test case, but their final values are not retained between test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. It then calculates an integer value `ans` based on the inputs `n` and `m` using a loop that iterates while `count` is less than or equal to `m`. The final value of `ans` is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value, and the variables `n`, `m`, `count`, `countmins`, and `g` are reset for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the calculation of the number of valid pairs for the given conditions. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of valid pairs is flawed. For example, consider the input `n = 3` and `m = 5`. According to the problem description, the valid pairs should be `(1,1)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,2)`, `(3,1)`, and `(3,3)`, which totals 5 pairs. However, the program outputs 4, which is incorrect.

To further illustrate, let's break down the logic:
- The program initializes `ans` with `n`, which is not always correct.
- The loop that increments `count` and calculates `g` and `ans` does not accurately count the pairs that satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

A correct implementation would need to properly count the pairs by iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking the condition for each pair. The current implementation does not do this correctly.
