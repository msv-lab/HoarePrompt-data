Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins given the constraints of the casino's rules. The key points are:
1. If Sasha wins a bet of `y` coins, he gains `y * (k - 1)` coins.
2. If Sasha loses a bet of `y` coins, he loses `y` coins.
3. Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
4. Initially, Sasha has `a` coins.

The strategy to determine if Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins involves calculating the minimum number of coins `s` that Sasha needs to start with to ensure he can always recover from a series of losses. The idea is to simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row and then wins once. If the initial number of coins `a` is at least as large as this minimum value `s`, then Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins.

The program calculates `s` by starting with 1 coin and simulating the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row and then winning once. For each loss, the bet amount is increased to ensure that after `x` losses and one win, Sasha will have at least 1 coin left.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program:
1. For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
2. It initializes `s` to 1, representing the initial bet amount.
3. It then iterates `x` times, each time increasing `s` to account for the worst-case scenario of losing the bet and then winning once.
4. The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is used to calculate the new bet amount after each loss. This formula ensures that after `x` losses, the next win will bring Sasha back to at least 1 coin.
5. Finally, it prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'.

The logic of the program is correct because it simulates the worst-case scenario and checks if Sasha's initial number of coins is sufficient to ensure he can always recover from `x` consecutive losses and still have at least 1 coin left to continue betting.

However, there is a minor issue with the output format. The problem specifies that the output should be "YES" or "NO" (case-insensitive), but the program prints 'Yes' and 'No'. This is a minor formatting issue but does not affect the correctness of the logic.

Given the above reasoning, the program is logically correct but has a minor formatting issue.

Correctness: **True** (with a minor formatting issue)
