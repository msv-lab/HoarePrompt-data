Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum cost when `A` (the number of yogurts) is odd is incorrect. The program prints the result of `X` (which is `A // 2`) and then calculates `X * C + B`, but it should directly print the result of `X * C + B` without the intermediate print statement. This intermediate print statement will cause the program to print an additional, incorrect line for each test case where `A` is odd.

For example, for the input:
```
4
2 5 9
3 5 9
3 5 11
4 5 11
```
The program will output:
```
9
14
1
15
2
20
```
Instead of the correct output:
```
9
14
15
20
```

This clearly shows the program is not handling the odd `A` case correctly.
