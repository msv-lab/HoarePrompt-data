### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`.

2. **Condition for Regular Price vs. Promotion Price:**
   - The first condition checks if the regular price for two yogurts (`B * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`C`). If this is true, it means that buying yogurts individually is cheaper, and the function prints the total cost as `A * B`.

3. **Condition for Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - The second condition checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even. If `A` is even, the function prints the total cost as `A * C / 2`, which is the cost of buying all yogurts at the promotion price.

4. **Condition for Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - The third condition handles the case where `A` is odd. It calculates `X` as `A // 2`, which is the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price. It then prints `X` and `X * C + B`, which is the cost of buying `X` pairs at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The function prints the results directly to the console, which is consistent with the problem description.

6. **Logical Errors:**
   - The function has a logical error in the third condition. It prints `X` and `X * C + B` on separate lines, but the problem description requires the total cost to be printed on a single line. This will cause the output to be incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The function is almost correct in its logic, but it fails to meet the output format requirement for the third condition. Instead of printing `X` and `X * C + B` on separate lines, it should print only the total cost `X * C + B` on a single line. This is a critical error that affects the correctness of the program.
