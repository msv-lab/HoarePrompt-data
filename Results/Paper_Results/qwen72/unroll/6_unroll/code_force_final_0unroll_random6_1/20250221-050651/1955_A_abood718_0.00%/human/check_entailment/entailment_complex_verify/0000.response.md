### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` from the input, where `A` is the number of yogurts, `B` is the price of one yogurt, and `C` is the price of two yogurts on promotion.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The first condition checks if the price of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`C`). If this is true, it prints `A * B`, which is the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price. This is correct because buying at the regular price is cheaper in this case.
   - The second condition checks if `A` is even. If `A` is even, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the total cost if all yogurts are bought in pairs at the promotion price. This is also correct because it ensures the minimum cost when `A` is even.
   - The third condition handles the case where `A` is odd. It calculates `X = A // 2`, which is the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought. It then prints `X` and `X * C + B`. The issue here is that it prints `X` unnecessarily, which is not part of the required output.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The program should only print one value per test case, which is the minimum cost.
   - The intermediate print statement `print(X)` is incorrect and should be removed.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issue with the program. The program does indeed print an extra line when `A` is odd, which is incorrect.
- The corrected code removes the unnecessary print statement and correctly handles all cases.

Final: **False**
