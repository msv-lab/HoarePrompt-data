### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case by reading two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - The program aims to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The program iterates over each possible value of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates a value \(x\) using the formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
   - It then adds \(x\) to `suma` if \(x > 0\).
   - Additionally, it checks if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) and adds 1 to `suma` if both conditions are true.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints `suma - 2` for each test case.

4. **Issues:**
   - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) does not directly correspond to the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The additional check \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) is not necessary and does not align with the problem's conditions.
   - The subtraction of 2 at the end (`print(suma - 2)`) is arbitrary and does not have a clear justification based on the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as described in the problem. The formula and additional checks used in the program do not align with the problem's requirements, and the arbitrary subtraction of 2 at the end is incorrect.
