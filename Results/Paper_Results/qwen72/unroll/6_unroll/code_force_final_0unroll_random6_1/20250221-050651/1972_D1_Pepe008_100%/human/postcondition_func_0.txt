The function reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `a` and `b` from the input, calculates a value `suma` based on these inputs, and prints `suma - 2`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `n` and `m` (if they exist outside the function) remain unchanged, and `T` remains the same as the initial value.
