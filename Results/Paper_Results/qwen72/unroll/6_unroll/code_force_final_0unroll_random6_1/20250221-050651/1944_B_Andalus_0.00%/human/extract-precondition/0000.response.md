Precondition: **Each test case contains an integer n and an integer k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The array a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^4.**
