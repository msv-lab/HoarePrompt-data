You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains an integer n and an integer k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The array a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^4.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        lft = lst[:n]
        
        rgt = lst[n:]
        
        ldb = []
        
        rdb = []

        for i in range(1, n):
            if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
                ldb.append(lft[i])
            elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
                sng.append(lft[i])
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:

        sz = 0
        
        for elem in ldb:
            if sz >= k:
                break
            if k - sz >= 2:
                print(elem, elem, end=' ')
                sz += 2
        
        for elem in sng:
            if sz >= k:
                break
            print(elem, end=' ')
            sz += 1
        
        print()
        
        sz = 0
        
        for elem in rdb:
            if sz >= k:
                break
            if k - sz >= 2:
                print(elem, elem, end=' ')
                sz += 2
        
        for elem in sng:
            if sz >= k:
                break
            print(elem, end=' ')
            sz += 1
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` will have been used to produce the specified output for each test case, but their final values will not be retained for the next test case. The loop will have printed pairs of elements from `ldb` and `rdb` and single elements from `sng` up to `k` elements for each half of the array, and the final state of these variables will be reset for the next iteration. The sum of `n` over all test cases will still not exceed 5 · 10^4.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and an array `a` of `2n` integers where each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice. It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the array `a`.
