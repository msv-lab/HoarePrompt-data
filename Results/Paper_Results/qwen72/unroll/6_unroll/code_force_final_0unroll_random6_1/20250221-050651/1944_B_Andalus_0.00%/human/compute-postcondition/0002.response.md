Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` will have been used to produce the specified output for each test case, but their final values will not be retained for the next test case. The loop will have printed pairs of elements from `ldb` and `rdb` and single elements from `sng` up to `k` elements for each half of the array, and the final state of these variables will be reset for the next iteration. The sum of `n` over all test cases will still not exceed 5 Â· 10^4.**
