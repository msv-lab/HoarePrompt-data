### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly parses the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` from the input and the array `lst` of length `2n`.

2. **Array Splitting:**
   - The program splits the array `lst` into two halves: `lft` (first half) and `rgt` (second half).

3. **Sorting:**
   - Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted. This is a valid step as it helps in identifying pairs of identical elements and single elements.

4. **Identifying Pairs and Single Elements:**
   - The program uses two lists `ldb` and `rdb` to store pairs of identical elements from `lft` and `rgt`, respectively.
   - It also uses a list `sng` to store single elements from `lft` that do not form pairs with their adjacent elements.

5. **Outputting Elements:**
   - The program then prints elements from `ldb` and `sng` to form the array `l` of length `2k`.
   - Similarly, it prints elements from `rdb` and `sng` to form the array `r` of length `2k`.

6. **Ensuring XOR Equality:**
   - The program ensures that the XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of elements in `r` by printing pairs of identical elements first and then single elements if necessary.
   - However, the program does not explicitly check if the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal. This is a critical flaw because the problem requires that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` be equal.

7. **Handling Single Elements:**
   - The program handles single elements by printing them from the `sng` list, but it does not guarantee that the XOR condition will be met. This is because the XOR of a single element is not necessarily equal to the XOR of another single element.

8. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is correct, as it prints `2k` elements for both `l` and `r` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program does not ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal, which is a fundamental requirement of the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
