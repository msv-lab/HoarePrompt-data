The code snippet `lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]` replaces the elements in the list `lst` from index `r` to index `l` (inclusive) with a list of `n` elements, where each element is equal to `n`. The value of `n` is `l - r + 1`, which represents the number of elements in the slice `lst[r:l + 1]`.

Output State: **`lst` has been updated such that the elements from index `r` to index `l` are all equal to `n` (where `n = l - r + 1`), and the rest of the list remains unchanged. `r` and `l` are still non-negative integers with `0 <= r <= l < len(lst)`, and `ops` is a list that contains the operations `[r + 1, l + 1]` once or twice, and now also contains the operations `[r + 1, r + 1]` and `[r + 1, l + 1]` again.**
