### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing operations that replace a subarray with the MEX of that subarray. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The operations are limited to no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(lst)`**:
     - This function is designed to find the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum of the array after performing the operation on the subarray `lst[r:l+1]`.
     - The function iterates over all possible subarrays, calculates the potential sum after the operation, and updates `r` and `l` if a better sum is found.
     - The function correctly identifies the optimal subarray to replace with its MEX.

   - **`func_2(r, l, ops)`**:
     - This function is intended to append the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list multiple times, specifically \(2^{(l - r)}\) times.
     - However, the function does not actually perform the operation on the array; it only appends the operation to the `ops` list.
     - The function is recursive and will append the operation multiple times, which is not necessary for the problem and can lead to an excessive number of operations.

   - **`func_3(r, l, lst, ops)`**:
     - This function performs the actual operation on the array `lst` by replacing the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` with the MEX of the subarray.
     - The function appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list multiple times, which is not necessary and can lead to an excessive number of operations.
     - The function sets the elements in the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` to the length of the subarray `n = l - r + 1`, which is not the MEX but the length of the subarray. This is incorrect because the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not the length of the subarray.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program repeatedly calls `func_1` to find the optimal subarray to replace, then calls `func_3` to perform the replacement and update the `ops` list.
   - After the main loop, it attempts to replace all zeros in the array with ones, which is a valid operation but not necessarily optimal.

4. **Issues**:
   - **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: `func_3` sets the subarray to the length of the subarray, not the MEX. This is a critical error.
   - **Excessive Operations**: `func_2` and `func_3` append the same operation multiple times, which is unnecessary and can lead to more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) operations.
   - **Suboptimal Strategy**: The strategy of replacing subarrays with the length of the subarray instead of the MEX is not optimal for maximizing the sum.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray and it appends the same operation multiple times, leading to potential inefficiency and incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
