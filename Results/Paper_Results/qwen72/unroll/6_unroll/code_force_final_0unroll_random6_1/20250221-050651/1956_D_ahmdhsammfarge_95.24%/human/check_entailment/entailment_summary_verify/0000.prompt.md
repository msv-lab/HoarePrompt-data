You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                (r, l) = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
    return (r, l)

#Function 2:
def func_2(r, l, ops: list):
    if r == l:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)

#Function 3:
def func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It modifies the list `lst` by setting the elements from index `r` to index `l` to the value `n` (where `n = l - r + 1`), and returns the modified list `lst`. Additionally, the function appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list at least twice, and if the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, it appends this operation a third time. The rest of the list `lst` remains unchanged.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to find the optimal range `[r, l]` to maximize the sum of the array, but it does not correctly compute the MEX value for the chosen range. The MEX value is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the range, and the program should update the elements in the range to this MEX value, not to `(j - i + 1) ** 2`.

Additionally, the functions `func_2` and `func_3` are not correctly handling the operations to update the array and construct the sequence of operations. For example, in `func_3`, the operations are added multiple times, which is unnecessary and can lead to more operations than allowed.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
0 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6 1
1 3
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will not correctly compute the MEX value for the range `[1, 3]` and will not update the array elements to the MEX value. Instead, it will perform incorrect operations and may not achieve the maximum sum.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
