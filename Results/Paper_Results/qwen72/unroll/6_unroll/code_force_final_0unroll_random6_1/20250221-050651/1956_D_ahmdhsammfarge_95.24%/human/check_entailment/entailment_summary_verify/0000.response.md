### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and validate the assessment using the function summaries and the problem description:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Problem Description**: The function should find the optimal range `[l, r]` to maximize the sum of the array by computing the MEX value for the chosen range and updating the elements in that range to the MEX value.
   - **Actual Implementation**: The function `func_1` computes the sum of the array excluding the chosen range and adds `(j - i + 1) ** 2` to it. This is incorrect because it does not compute the MEX value for the range `[i, j]`.
   - **Function Summary**: The summary is not provided for `func_1`, but based on the code, it is clear that the function does not compute the MEX value.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Problem Description**: The function should construct a sequence of operations to update the array elements to the MEX value of the chosen range.
   - **Actual Implementation**: The function `func_2` recursively appends operations to the `ops` list. However, it does not correctly handle the MEX value or the update of the array elements.
   - **Function Summary**: The summary is not provided for `func_2`, but the function is clearly not designed to handle the MEX value or the array updates.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - **Problem Description**: The function should update the elements in the range `[r, l]` to the MEX value and construct the sequence of operations.
   - **Actual Implementation**: The function `func_3` appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times, which is unnecessary and can lead to more operations than allowed. It also sets the elements in the range `[r, l]` to `n` (where `n = l - r + 1`), which is incorrect because it should set them to the MEX value.
   - **Function Summary**: The provided summary states that the function sets the elements in the range `[r, l]` to `n` and appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times. This is consistent with the code but does not align with the problem requirements.

### Specific Case Analysis:
- **Input**: `3 0 1 2`
- **Expected Output**: `6 1 1 3`
- **Actual Output**:
  - `func_1` will not correctly compute the MEX value for the range `[0, 2]`.
  - `func_3` will set the elements in the range `[0, 2]` to `3` (the length of the range), which is incorrect.
  - The operations will be added multiple times, leading to more operations than necessary.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the MEX value and does not update the array elements to the MEX value. Additionally, it performs unnecessary operations and may exceed the allowed number of operations. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
