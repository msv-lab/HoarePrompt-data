The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers and returns a tuple `(r, l)` representing the start and end indices of a sublist in `lst` such that the sum of the elements outside this sublist plus the square of the length of the sublist is maximized. The function ensures that `r` and `l` are the indices that achieve this maximum sum, and `over_sum` holds the maximum value of this sum.
