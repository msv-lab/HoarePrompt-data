### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the array `a` by performing operations that replace a subarray `a[l...r]` with the MEX value of that subarray.
   - The MEX value is defined as the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The goal is to output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations to achieve this sum.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**
   - The function aims to find the subarray `a[l...r]` that, when replaced with its MEX value, maximizes the sum of the array.
   - The function iterates over all possible subarrays and computes a potential sum if the subarray is replaced with its MEX value.
   - However, the MEX value is incorrectly approximated by `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is the square of the subarray length. This is not the correct MEX value.
   - The correct MEX value should be computed by finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - Therefore, the function does not correctly compute the MEX value or the optimal subarray to maximize the sum.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**
   - This function is intended to generate a sequence of operations to set the subarray `a[r...l]` to the MEX value.
   - It recursively adds operations to the list `ops` to set the subarray to the MEX value.
   - However, it does not correctly handle the MEX value or the subarray replacement logic.
   - The function appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times, which is not necessary and does not follow the correct approach to solve the problem.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**
   - This function is intended to perform the operation on the subarray `a[r...l]` and update the array `lst` and the operations list `ops`.
   - It adds an operation to set the subarray to the MEX value.
   - It checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0 and adds an additional operation if true.
   - It then recursively calls `func_2` to generate more operations.
   - Finally, it sets the subarray to the MEX value, which is the length of the subarray.
   - The logic here is also flawed because it does not correctly compute the MEX value. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not the length of the subarray.

5. **Main Program:**
   - The main program reads the input, initializes the list `lst` and the operations list `ops`.
   - It calls `func_1` to find the optimal subarray and then enters a loop to repeatedly call `func_3` until `r` equals `l`.
   - After the loop, it attempts to replace all remaining 0s in the list with 1s.
   - The program then prints the sum of the modified list and the number of operations performed, followed by the operations themselves.
   - The main logic is flawed because the MEX value is not correctly computed, and the operations generated do not follow the correct approach to maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the MEX value or the optimal subarray to maximize the sum. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` contain logical errors and do not follow the correct approach to solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**False**
