### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).
   - We can perform an operation that selects a subarray `a[l...r]`, computes the MEX of this subarray, and sets all elements in this subarray to the MEX value.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array and provide a sequence of operations to achieve this sum.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**
   - This function aims to find the subarray `a[l...r]` that, when replaced with its MEX value, maximizes the sum of the array.
   - It iterates over all possible subarrays and computes the potential sum if the subarray is replaced with its MEX value.
   - The MEX value of a subarray is approximated by `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is not correct. The MEX value is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not the square of the subarray length.
   - Therefore, this function does not correctly compute the MEX value or the optimal subarray to maximize the sum.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**
   - This function is intended to generate a sequence of operations to set the subarray `a[r...l]` to the MEX value.
   - It recursively adds operations to the list `ops` to set the subarray to the MEX value.
   - However, it does not correctly handle the MEX value or the subarray replacement logic.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**
   - This function is intended to perform the operation on the subarray `a[r...l]` and update the array `lst` and the operations list `ops`.
   - It adds an operation to set the subarray to the MEX value.
   - It checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0 and adds an additional operation if true.
   - It then recursively calls `func_2` to generate more operations.
   - Finally, it sets the subarray to the MEX value, which is the length of the subarray.
   - The logic here is also flawed because it does not correctly compute the MEX value.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the MEX value or the optimal subarray to maximize the sum. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` contain logical errors and do not follow the correct approach to solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**False**
