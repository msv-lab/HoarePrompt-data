The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and the total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. The function is expected to return a result for each test case.

Since the specific output for each test case is not provided, I will assume the function returns a result for each pair `(a, b)` based on some operation or condition. If you can provide more details on the output, I can refine the description.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). It returns a result for each test case, with the total number of test cases `t` being an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.**
