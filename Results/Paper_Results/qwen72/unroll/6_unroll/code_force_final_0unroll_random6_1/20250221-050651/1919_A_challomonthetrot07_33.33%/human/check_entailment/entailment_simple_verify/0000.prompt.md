You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

    #State: The values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged. For each iteration of the loop, the values of `a` and `b` are read from input and the loop prints 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the conditions specified. After all iterations, the values of `a` and `b` are not retained and are reset for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
1
2 3
```
According to the problem description, Alice and Bob play optimally. Here's how the game should proceed:

1. **Alice's Turn:**
   - Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob.
   - After swapping, Alice has 3 coins, and Bob has 2 coins.
   - Alice removes 1 coin from her wallet.
   - Now, Alice has 2 coins, and Bob has 2 coins.

2. **Bob's Turn:**
   - Bob can choose to swap wallets with Alice.
   - After swapping, Bob has 2 coins, and Alice has 2 coins.
   - Bob removes 1 coin from his wallet.
   - Now, Bob has 1 coin, and Alice has 2 coins.

3. **Alice's Turn:**
   - Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob.
   - After swapping, Alice has 1 coin, and Bob has 2 coins.
   - Alice removes 1 coin from her wallet.
   - Now, Alice has 0 coins, and Bob has 2 coins.

4. **Bob's Turn:**
   - Bob can choose to swap wallets with Alice.
   - After swapping, Bob has 0 coins, and Alice has 2 coins.
   - Bob cannot make a move because his wallet is empty.

In this scenario, Alice wins. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Bob" for this case. This is because the program does not correctly account for the optimal strategies that Alice and Bob can use, especially in cases where the number of coins is small and the parity of the coins is crucial.

The logic in the program is flawed in several ways:
- It incorrectly assumes that if `a == b`, Bob will always win, which is not necessarily true.
- It incorrectly handles the cases where `a` and `b` are both even or both odd.
- It does not correctly simulate the optimal play for both players, especially in cases where the number of coins is small.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
