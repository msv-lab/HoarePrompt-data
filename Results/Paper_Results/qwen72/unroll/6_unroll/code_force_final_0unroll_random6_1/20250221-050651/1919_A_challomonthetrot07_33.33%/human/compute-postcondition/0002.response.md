Output State: **The values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged. For each iteration of the loop, the values of `a` and `b` are read from input and the loop prints 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the conditions specified. After all iterations, the values of `a` and `b` are not retained and are reset for each iteration.**
