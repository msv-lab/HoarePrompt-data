Output State: **The variable `t` is decremented to 0, `n` is the last input integer read, and `a` is the last list of `n` positive integers read. The loop prints the minimum value of `a` if `n` is 2, otherwise it prints the maximum of the second smallest elements in every consecutive triplet of `a`.**
