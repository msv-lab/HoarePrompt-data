#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving an array `a` of positive integers. However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `n`, and `a` to match the problem description. The preconditions for these parameters are: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        
        max = 0
        
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        
        print(max)
        
    #State: The variable `t` is decremented to 0, `n` is the last input integer read, and `a` is the last list of `n` positive integers read. The loop prints the minimum value of `a` if `n` is 2, otherwise it prints the maximum of the second smallest elements in every consecutive triplet of `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. If `n` is 2, it prints the minimum value of the list `a`. Otherwise, it prints the maximum of the second smallest elements in every consecutive triplet of `a`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed and the appropriate output has been printed for each.
