The function `func` should accept parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the problem description.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, each between 1 and 10^9. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information.**
