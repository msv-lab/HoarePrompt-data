Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. If `n` is 2, it prints the minimum value of the list `a`. Otherwise, it prints the maximum of the second smallest elements in every consecutive triplet of `a`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed and the appropriate output has been printed for each. **
