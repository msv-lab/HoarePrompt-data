You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        max = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        print(max)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. If `n` is 2, it prints the minimum value of the list `a`. Otherwise, it prints the maximum of the second smallest elements in every consecutive triplet of `a`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed and the appropriate output has been printed for each.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Edge Case for n = 2:**
   - If the length of the array `n` is 2, the program prints the minimum of the two elements. This is correct because, in this case, the only possible operation is to choose the entire array, and the median of two elements is the smaller one. Therefore, the array will be changed to `[min(a), min(a)]`, and the maximum value of the final number is `min(a)`.

3. **General Case for n > 2:**
   - The program initializes `max` to 0.
   - It iterates over the array in windows of size 3 (i.e., subarrays of length 3).
   - For each window, it sorts the subarray and takes the median (the second element after sorting).
   - It updates `max` if the median of the current window is greater than the current `max`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all windows, the program prints the maximum median value found.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The program aims to find the maximum possible value that the array can be transformed into by repeatedly applying the operation described.
  - The median of a subarray of length 3 is the middle element after sorting. This means that the median is the value that is not the smallest or the largest in the subarray.
  - By iterating over all possible subarrays of length 3 and keeping track of the maximum median, the program ensures that it finds the largest possible value that can be used to transform the entire array.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - For `n = 2`, the program correctly handles the edge case by printing the minimum of the two elements.
  - For `n > 2`, the program correctly iterates over all possible subarrays of length 3 and updates the maximum median value.

- **Optimality:**
  - The program's approach of considering subarrays of length 3 is optimal because the median of a subarray of length 3 is the only value that can be used to transform the entire array in a single operation.
  - By finding the maximum median value among all such subarrays, the program ensures that it finds the largest possible value that can be used to transform the array.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
