Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is acceptable since it reads input from `stdin`.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

2. **Modulo and Inverse Calculation**:
   - The modulo value `M` is correctly set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct because the number of possible pairs of children is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), and `c` is used to normalize the probability of selecting a friend pair.

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The variable `a` is used to accumulate the sum of initial friendship values of all friend pairs. This is correctly done by reading each friend pair and adding their friendship value to `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The variable `s` is used to accumulate the expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.
   - The loop that runs `k` times is intended to calculate the expected value incrementally. However, the logic inside the loop is incorrect:
     - The term `c * i * c * m` is intended to account for the increase in friendship value due to the selection of friend pairs. However, this term is incorrect because it does not properly model the expected increase in friendship value.
     - The term `c * a` is intended to account for the initial friendship values, but it is also incorrectly added in each iteration.

5. **Correct Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The correct expected value for each excursion is the sum of the initial friendship values of all friend pairs plus the expected increase in friendship value due to the selection of friend pairs.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is `c * m` because each friend pair has a probability of `c` of being selected, and there are `m` friend pairs.
   - Therefore, the correct expected value for each excursion is `a + i * c * m`, where `i` is the current excursion number.

6. **Final Output**:
   - The final value of `s` should be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and printed.

Given the incorrect logic in the expected value calculation, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
