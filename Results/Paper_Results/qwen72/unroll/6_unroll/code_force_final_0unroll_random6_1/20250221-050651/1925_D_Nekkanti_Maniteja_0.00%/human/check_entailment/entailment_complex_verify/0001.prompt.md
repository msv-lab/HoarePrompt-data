You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program: 
def func():

        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        s = 0

        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not properly defined to solve the given problem. It should accept parameters for the number of test cases, the number of children, the number of friend pairs, the number of excursions, and the list of friend pairs with their initial friendship values. The correct function definition should be:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        
        s = 0
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        
        print(s % M)
        
    #State: The function will execute the loop for the specified number of test cases, and for each test case, it will calculate the value of `s` based on the inputs and print `s % M`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, and `s` will be updated for each test case, but the overall state of the function will reset for each new test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of children (`n`), the number of friend pairs (`m`), and the number of excursions (`k`). It then calculates a value `s` based on these inputs and the initial friendship values of the friend pairs. The final value of `s` is computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and printed. The function does not return any value. The state of the function resets for each new test case, and the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, and `s` are updated accordingly for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have `n` children, `m` pairs of friends, and `k` excursions.
   - Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value `f_i`.
   - For each excursion, a pair of children is chosen randomly. If they are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions, and return it as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing the indices of a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair of children is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - The program calculates this probability as `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`, which is correct. The `// 1` is redundant but does not affect the result.

4. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The program correctly sums the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends and stores it in `a`.

5. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion is calculated in a loop.
   - For the `i`-th excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
     - `c * i * c * m` accounts for the expected increase in friendship values due to the pairs being chosen and their values increasing by 1.
     - `c * a` accounts for the initial friendship values.
   - The program sums these expected values over all `k` excursions.

6. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program correctly takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

### Issues:
- **Redundant Loop Index**:
  - The loop index `i` in the first loop is shadowing the outer loop index `i`. This is not a functional issue but can be confusing and should be avoided.
- **Incorrect Expected Value Calculation**:
  - The expected value calculation in the loop is incorrect. The term `c * i * c * m` should be `c * m * i` because the probability of choosing a pair of friends is `c * m`, and the expected increase in friendship value for the `i`-th excursion is `i` (since the value increases by 1 for each previous excursion).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)  # Corrected the denominator
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * m * i + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the expected value calculation.
- The corrected program correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all excursions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
