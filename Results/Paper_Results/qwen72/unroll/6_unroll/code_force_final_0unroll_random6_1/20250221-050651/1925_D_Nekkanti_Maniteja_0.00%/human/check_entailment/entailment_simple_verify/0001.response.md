### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen over `k` excursions.
   - Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value `f_i`.
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing the indices of a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair of children is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - The program calculates this probability as `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`, which is correct. However, the `// 1` is redundant and can be simplified to `c = pow(n * (n - 1), -1, M)`.

4. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The program correctly sums the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends and stores it in `a`.

5. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value calculation in the loop is incorrect.
   - The term `c * i * c * m` should be `c * m * i` because the probability of choosing a pair of friends is `c * m`, and the expected increase in friendship value for the `i`-th excursion is `i` (since the value increases by 1 for each previous excursion).
   - The corrected term should be `c * m * i + c * a`.

6. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program correctly takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

### Issues:
- **Redundant Loop Index**:
  - The loop index `i` in the first loop is shadowing the outer loop index `i`. This is not a functional issue but can be confusing and should be avoided.
- **Incorrect Expected Value Calculation**:
  - The term `c * i * c * m` should be `c * m * i` to correctly calculate the expected increase in friendship values.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)  # Corrected the denominator
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * m * i + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the expected value calculation.
- The corrected program correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all excursions.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the logical error in the expected value calculation. The corrected program, as provided, is the correct solution.
