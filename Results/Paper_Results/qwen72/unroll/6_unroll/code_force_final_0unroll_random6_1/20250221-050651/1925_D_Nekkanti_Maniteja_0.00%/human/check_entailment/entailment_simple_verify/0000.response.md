Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the issue with the given program. The problem lies in the way the expected value is being computed in the loop:

```python
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
```

This loop incorrectly assumes that the friendship value of each pair increases linearly with each excursion, which is not the case. The correct approach should account for the probability of a pair being chosen and the cumulative effect of the friendship value increases over the excursions.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Initial Expected Value Calculation:**
   - For each pair of friends, the initial expected value of the friendship value being chosen in one excursion is \(\frac{f_i}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The total initial expected value for all pairs is \(\sum \frac{f_i}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

2. **Expected Value Increase:**
   - For each excursion, the probability of a pair being chosen is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - If a pair is chosen, its friendship value increases by 1, and this increase should be considered for subsequent excursions.

3. **Cumulative Expected Value:**
   - The expected value for each pair after \(k\) excursions can be calculated using the formula for the expected value of a geometric series.
   - The total expected value after \(k\) excursions is the sum of the expected values for each pair.

### Example Case:
For the input:
```
2 1 10
1 2 1
```
The program should output:
```
55
```
However, the current program's logic will not correctly compute this because it does not account for the cumulative effect of the friendship value increases over the excursions.

### Corrected Code:
The corrected code provided in the original assessment is indeed correct. It properly calculates the expected value by considering the initial friendship values and the cumulative effect of the friendship value increases over the excursions:

```python
def func():
    mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, mod)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % mod
        expected_value = (a * c * k) % mod
        for _ in range(k):
            expected_value = (expected_value + c * m) % mod
        print(expected_value)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- **Initial Expected Value Calculation:**
  - `a` is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs.
  - `c` is the modular inverse of the total number of pairs, which is used to calculate the probability of a pair being chosen.
  - `expected_value` is initialized to the initial expected value of the sum of friendship values over \(k\) excursions, which is \((a * c * k) \mod M\).

- **Cumulative Expected Value Calculation:**
  - For each excursion, the expected value of the sum of friendship values increases by \((c * m) \mod M\), which accounts for the probability of any pair being chosen and the increase in friendship value.

This corrected code correctly implements the logic to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen in the excursions.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the given program and providing a correct solution. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False** (The given program is incorrect, and the corrected code provided in the original assessment is correct.)
