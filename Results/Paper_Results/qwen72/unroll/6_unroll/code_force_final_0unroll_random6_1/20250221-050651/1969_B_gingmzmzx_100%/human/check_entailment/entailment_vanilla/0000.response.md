### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts.
   - A cyclic shift of a substring \( s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r \) costs \( r - l + 1 \) (the length of the substring).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it converts the input string \( s \) into a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeroes in the string.
   - It initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It iterates through the string and updates the counter and the answer based on the current character.

3. **Detailed Analysis of the Logic:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - For each character \( c \) in the string:
     - If \( c \) is 0, it adds 1 to `ans` if there is at least one 1 before it (`cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If \( c \) is 1, it adds the number of remaining zeroes to `ans` (`zeroes - cnt[0]`).

4. **Explanation of the Logic:**
   - The idea is to count the number of 1s that need to be moved to the right of the current 0, and the number of 0s that need to be moved to the left of the current 1.
   - The cost for each 0 is 1 if there is at least one 1 before it, because it needs to be moved to the left of the 1.
   - The cost for each 1 is the number of remaining zeroes, because each 1 needs to be moved to the right of all remaining 0s.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1: "10"**
     - `zeroes = 1`
     - `cnt = [0, 0]`
     - `ans = 0`
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0`
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 1` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - Total cost: 2
   - **Example 2: "0000"**
     - `zeroes = 4`
     - `cnt = [0, 0]`
     - `ans = 0`
     - No 1s, so no cost is added.
     - Total cost: 0
   - **Example 3: "11000"**
     - `zeroes = 3`
     - `cnt = [0, 0]`
     - `ans = 0`
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0`
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [0, 2]`, `ans = 0`
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 1` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 2` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [3, 2]`, `ans = 3` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - Total cost: 9
   - **Example 4: "101011"**
     - `zeroes = 2`
     - `cnt = [0, 0]`
     - `ans = 0`
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0`
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 1` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 1`
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 2` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [2, 3]`, `ans = 2`
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [2, 4]`, `ans = 2`
     - Total cost: 5
   - **Example 5: "01101001"**
     - `zeroes = 4`
     - `cnt = [0, 0]`
     - `ans = 0`
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 0]`, `ans = 0`
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 3` (since `zeroes - cnt[0] = 3`)
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 6` (since `zeroes - cnt[0] = 3`)
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 7` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [2, 3]`, `ans = 9` (since `zeroes - cnt[0] = 2`)
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [3, 3]`, `ans = 10` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [4, 3]`, `ans = 11` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [4, 4]`, `ans = 11`
     - Total cost: 11
