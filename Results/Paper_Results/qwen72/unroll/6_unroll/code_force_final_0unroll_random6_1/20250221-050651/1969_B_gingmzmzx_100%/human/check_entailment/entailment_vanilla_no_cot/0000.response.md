Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given examples and the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **String Conversion**: Each binary string is converted to a list of integers, which makes it easier to count and manipulate the characters.
3. **Counting Zeroes**: The program counts the number of zeroes in the string, which is used to calculate the cost of cyclic shifts involving ones.
4. **Cost Calculation**: The program iterates through the string and maintains a count of the number of ones and zeroes encountered so far. It calculates the cost of cyclic shifts as follows:
   - If the current character is `0` and there are ones before it, it adds 1 to the total cost.
   - If the current character is `1`, it adds the number of zeroes that have not been counted yet to the total cost.
5. **Output**: The program prints the total cost for each test case.

This approach ensures that the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order is calculated correctly. The logic aligns with the problem's requirements and the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
