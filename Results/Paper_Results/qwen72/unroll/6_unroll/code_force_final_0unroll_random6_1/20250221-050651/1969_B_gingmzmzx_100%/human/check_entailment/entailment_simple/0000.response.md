### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.

2. **Counting Zeroes**:
   - The program counts the number of zeroes in the string `s` using `s.count(0)`. This is correct and necessary for the algorithm.

3. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a list `cnt` with two elements, both set to 0. This list will keep track of the counts of '0's and '1's as the program iterates through the string.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. This variable will accumulate the total cost of the operations needed to sort the string.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - If `c` is 0, it checks if there are any '1's before it (`cnt[1] > 0`). If there are, it increments `ans` by 1. This is because a '0' following a '1' indicates that a cyclic shift is needed to move the '1' to the right of the '0'.
   - If `c` is 1, it adds the difference between the total number of zeroes and the number of zeroes seen so far (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`. This is because each '1' that is not in its final position (i.e., to the right of all '0's) needs to be moved to the right, and the cost is the number of '0's it needs to pass.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the computed `ans` for each test case, which is the minimum total cost to sort the string.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The algorithm correctly identifies the cost of moving '1's to the right of '0's.
- The cost calculation is based on the number of '0's and '1's in the string, which is a valid approach for determining the minimum cost of cyclic shifts.
- The program handles the edge case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by correctly printing 0.

### Example Test Cases:
- For the string "10", the program correctly calculates the cost as 2.
- For the string "0000", the program correctly calculates the cost as 0.
- For the string "11000", the program correctly calculates the cost as 9.
- For the string "101011", the program correctly calculates the cost as 5.
- For the string "01101001", the program correctly calculates the cost as 11.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. The reasoning and the output for the given examples are consistent with the problem description.
