Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a list `arr` of integers and processes it to find segments of consecutive non-negative numbers. It returns a list `total_max_segment` that contains the sum of the segment with the highest sum of non-negative numbers, the starting index of this segment, the ending index of this segment, and the last index of the input list `arr`. If no non-negative numbers are found, the function returns a list with the first element as -1 and the remaining elements as the last index of `arr`. **
