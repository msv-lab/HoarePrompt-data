You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the winning outcomes. The total number of test cases, t, is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        def lcm(l):
            g = 1
            for i in range(len(l)):
                g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
            return g
        
        bets = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        prod = lcm(a)
        
        sumo = 0
        
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop has processed all test cases. For each test case, if the sum of the transformed multipliers (which are the result of dividing the least common multiple of the original multipliers by each multiplier) is greater than or equal to the least common multiple, the output is -1. Otherwise, the output is a space-separated list of the transformed multipliers. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has completed all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`. It returns the results for each test case based on the provided inputs, ensuring that the number of test cases `t` is within the range 1 to 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
