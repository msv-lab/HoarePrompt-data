Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Check**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in the string `s`. However, this approach is flawed because it only checks if a set of characters of size `k` appears in the string, and it does not generate or check all possible subsequences of length `n`.

2. **Generating Missing Subsequences**:
   - The program attempts to generate a missing subsequence by appending characters to `ans` and then adding a character not in `win`. This approach is incorrect because it does not ensure that the generated string is a valid subsequence of length `n` that is not present in `s`.

3. **Logical Flow**:
   - The program clears the `win` set once it has `k` unique characters, which is not the correct way to check for subsequences of length `n`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If any string is not a subsequence, print "NO" followed by that string.
4. If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(x, s):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in x)

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    alphabet = ''.join(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    all_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product(alphabet, repeat=n)]
    
    for string in all_strings:
        if not is_subsequence(string, s):
            print('NO')
            print(string)
            return
    print('YES')

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Generate All Possible Strings**:
   - Use `itertools.product` to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

2. **Subsequence Check**:
   - The function `is_subsequence` checks if a given string `x` is a subsequence of `s` by iterating through `s` and ensuring all characters of `x` appear in order.

3. **Main Function**:
   - For each test case, generate all possible strings of length `n`.
   - Check if each string is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, print "NO" followed by that string and return.
   - If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".

This approach ensures that the program correctly checks for all possible subsequences and generates a valid missing subsequence if needed.
