Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` containing `n-1` elements as specified.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to generate the array `a` that satisfies the conditions given in the problem.

3. **Initial Setup**: The function initializes the array `ans` with `n` elements, all set to 0. It then sets the first element `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`, ensuring that `1 <= a_1 <= 10^9`.

4. **Array Construction**:
   - For each element from `1` to `n-2`, it sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`. This ensures that `a_{i+1} \bmod a_i = arr[i]` because `a_{i+1}` is constructed to be exactly `arr[i]` more than a multiple of `a_i`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it adjusts `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` repeatedly until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that the condition `a_{i+1} \bmod a_i = arr[i]` is maintained and `a_{i+1}` is large enough to satisfy the next condition.
   - Finally, it sets `ans[-1]` (the last element) to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`, ensuring that the last condition `a_n \bmod a_{n-1} = arr[n-1]` is satisfied.

5. **Output**: The program prints the constructed array `ans` for each test case, which is the required array `a`.

The logic in the function `func_1` ensures that the conditions are met for all elements in the array, and the constraints `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` are also respected. Therefore, the program is correct.
