Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for `1 <= i < n-1`) is the smallest integer such that `ans[i] >= arr[i]` and `ans[i]` is a multiple of `ans[i-1]`, and the last element `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**
