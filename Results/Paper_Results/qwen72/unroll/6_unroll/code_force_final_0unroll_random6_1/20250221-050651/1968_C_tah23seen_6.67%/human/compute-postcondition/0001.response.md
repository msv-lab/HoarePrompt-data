Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) == n - 1, `ans` is a list of n zeros, `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1`.**

The initial state remains the same, except that the first element of the `ans` list (`ans[0]`) is now updated to be the value of the first element of the `arr` list plus 1. All other elements in the `ans` list remain zeros.
