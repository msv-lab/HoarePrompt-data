Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array `arr` contains values that are not strictly increasing. For example, consider the input:

```
1
4
2 4 2
```

The expected output should be an array `a` such that:
- `a_2 % a_1 = 2`
- `a_3 % a_2 = 4`
- `a_4 % a_3 = 2`

However, the program will produce the following output:
```
3 5 9 11
```

This output is incorrect because:
- `5 % 3 = 2` (correct)
- `9 % 5 = 4` (correct)
- `11 % 9 = 2` (incorrect, should be 11 % 9 = 2, but the program does not ensure this).

The issue lies in the way the program constructs the array `ans`. Specifically, the condition `if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]` is not sufficient to handle cases where `arr` contains non-increasing values. The program should ensure that `ans[i + 1]` is always greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` and that the modulo operation results in the correct value.
