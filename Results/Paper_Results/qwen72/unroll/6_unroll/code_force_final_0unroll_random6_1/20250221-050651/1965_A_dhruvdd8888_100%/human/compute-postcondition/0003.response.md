Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `piles` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums = sorted(map(int, nums))` converts the set `nums` to a list of integers and then sorts this list.
- Initially, `nums` is a set of strings that includes the string '0'.
- After the conversion and sorting, `nums` becomes a sorted list of integers, and it includes the integer 0.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `piles`, and `N` remain unchanged.
