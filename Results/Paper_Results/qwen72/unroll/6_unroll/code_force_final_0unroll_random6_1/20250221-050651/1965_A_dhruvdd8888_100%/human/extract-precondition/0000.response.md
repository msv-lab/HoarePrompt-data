It seems there was a mistake in the function definition provided. Based on the problem description, the function should take the number of test cases, the number of piles, and the list of piles as inputs. Here's the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def game_winner(t, n, piles):
```

Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles in the game, and piles is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where each a_i represents the initial number of stones in the i-th pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
