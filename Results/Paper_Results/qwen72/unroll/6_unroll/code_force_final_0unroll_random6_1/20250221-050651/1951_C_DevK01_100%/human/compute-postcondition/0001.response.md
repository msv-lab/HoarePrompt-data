The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)), and `a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
