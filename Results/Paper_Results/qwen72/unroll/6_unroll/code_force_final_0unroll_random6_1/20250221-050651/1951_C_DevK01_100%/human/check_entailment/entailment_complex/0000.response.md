### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line and the list of ticket prices `a` from the second line.

2. **Constraints:**
   - The constraints are handled correctly. The function ensures that `m` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, which is valid because a person can't buy more tickets than needed in a single day.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The list of ticket prices `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it allows the function to consider the cheapest days first.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets:**
   - The function calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`, which is the number of days needed to buy all `k` tickets. This is correct because it ensures that the tickets are bought in the minimum number of days possible.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The function selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `a` and stores them in `N`. This is correct because it ensures that the tickets are bought on the cheapest days.

6. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n * m == k`, it means that the tickets can be bought exactly in `n` days without any remainder. The cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, which accounts for the total cost of buying `m` tickets each day and the additional cost due to the price increase.
   - If `n * m != k`, it means there is a remainder `mu` of tickets that need to be bought on the last day. The function calculates the cost for the remaining tickets and adds it to the total cost. The formula used is correct for this scenario.

7. **Final Output:**
   - The function prints the calculated cost for each test case, which is the expected output.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem constraints and logic. The cost calculation is based on the sorted list of prices and the number of tickets that can be bought each day, which aligns with the problem description.

However, there is a potential issue in the cost calculation when `n * m != k`. The formula used for the additional cost might not be correct. Specifically, the term `n * m * mu` seems to be incorrect because it does not account for the price increase correctly.

### Corrected Cost Calculation:
- If `n * m == k`, the cost is correctly calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- If `n * m != k`, the correct cost calculation should be:
  - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + mu * (N[-1] + (n - 1) * m)`

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the potential issue in the cost calculation when `n * m != k`. The term `n * m * mu` in the cost calculation is incorrect and should be replaced with `mu * (N[-1] + (n - 1) * m)` to correctly account for the price increase on the last day.
