Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads two lines of input, processes the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and prints the calculated `cost`. The variables `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `N`, `q`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost` are updated and used within the loop, but their final values after the loop are not relevant to the initial state. The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged outside the loop.**
