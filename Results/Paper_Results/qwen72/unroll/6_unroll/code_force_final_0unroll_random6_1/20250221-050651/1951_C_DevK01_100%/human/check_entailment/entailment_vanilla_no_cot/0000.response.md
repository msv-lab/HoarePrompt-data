Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the total cost. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the cost calculation when the number of tickets to be bought is not a multiple of the maximum tickets that can be purchased per day (`m`). The program also incorrectly adds the cost of the last ticket purchase to the total cost. Here's a detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation for Non-Multiples of `m`:**
   - The program calculates the cost for the last purchase (`mu * w`) separately and then adds it to the total cost. However, it does not correctly account for the increased prices due to the tickets purchased on previous days.
   - The formula `cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` is incorrect. The term `n * m * mu` is not needed and leads to an overestimation of the cost.

2. **Incorrect Handling of the Last Purchase:**
   - The program pops the last element from the sorted list `N` and calculates the cost for the remaining tickets (`mu * w`). However, this does not correctly reflect the increased prices due to the tickets purchased on previous days.

3. **Incorrect Summation of Increased Prices:**
   - The term `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is used to account for the increased prices due to the tickets purchased on previous days. However, this formula is not correct for the given problem. The correct way to handle the increased prices is to add the number of tickets purchased on each day to the subsequent days' prices.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cost_to_buy_tickets():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the prices in ascending order
        prices.sort()
        
        # Initialize the total cost
        total_cost = 0
        
        # Initialize the number of tickets bought so far
        tickets_bought = 0
        
        # Initialize the day counter
        day = 0
        
        while tickets_bought < k:
            # Determine the number of tickets to buy on this day
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
            
            # Calculate the cost for this day
            cost = tickets_to_buy * prices[day]
            
            # Add the cost to the total cost
            total_cost += cost
            
            # Increase the tickets bought
            tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
            
            # Increase the prices for subsequent days
            for i in range(day + 1, n):
                prices[i] += tickets_to_buy
            
            # Move to the next day
            day += 1
        
        print(total_cost)

min_cost_to_buy_tickets()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The prices are sorted in ascending order to ensure that we buy tickets on the cheapest days first.

2. **Loop to Purchase Tickets:**
   - We use a while loop to keep purchasing tickets until we have bought `k` tickets.
   - On each day, we determine the number of tickets to buy, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - We calculate the cost for the tickets bought on the current day and add it to the total cost.
   - We update the number of tickets bought and increase the prices for subsequent days by the number of tickets bought on the current day.
   - We move to the next day.

This corrected program should correctly calculate the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets based on the given problem description.
