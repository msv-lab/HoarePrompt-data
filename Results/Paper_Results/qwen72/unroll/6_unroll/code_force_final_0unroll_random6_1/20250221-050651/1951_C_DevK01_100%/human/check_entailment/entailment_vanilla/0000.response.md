### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line of input.
   - It reads the list of ticket prices `M` from the second line of input.
   - It sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed.

2. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M` in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it allows the program to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Determining the Number of Days to Buy Tickets:**
   - The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`. This is the minimum number of days required to buy `k` tickets, given that no more than `m` tickets can be bought per day.

4. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to buy tickets. This ensures that the tickets are bought on the days with the lowest prices.

5. **Calculating the Cost:**
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days equals `k` (i.e., `n * m == k`), the program calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
     - `m * sum(N)` is the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `q` days.
     - `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is the additional cost due to the price increase for each subsequent day.
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days is less than `k`, the program adjusts the calculation:
     - It removes the last day from `N` and calculates the remaining tickets `mu` as `k - (n - 1) * m`.
     - It calculates the cost of buying `mu` tickets on the last day.
     - It then adds the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the remaining `n-1` days, along with the additional cost due to the price increase.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost calculation for the case where `n * m == k` is incorrect. The formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` does not account for the correct price increases.
  - The cost calculation for the case where `n * m != k` is also incorrect. The formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` does not correctly handle the price increases.

### Correct Cost Calculation:
- The correct approach to calculate the cost should be:
  - For each day `i` from 0 to `q-1`, the cost of buying `m` tickets on day `i` is `m * (M[i] + i * m)`.
  - If `k` is not a multiple of `m`, the cost of buying the remaining `mu` tickets on the last day is `mu * (M[q-1] + (q-1) * m)`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (n, m, k) = (L[0], L[1], L[2])
        m = min(m, k)
        M.sort()
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        N = M[:q]
        n = len(N)
        
        cost = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if i == n - 1 and k % m != 0:
                mu = k % m
                cost += mu * (N[i] + i * m)
            else:
                cost += m * (N[i] + i * m)
        
        print(cost)

func()
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the flawed cost calculation logic.
- The corrected program addresses these issues and should correctly calculate the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets.

Correctness: **False**
