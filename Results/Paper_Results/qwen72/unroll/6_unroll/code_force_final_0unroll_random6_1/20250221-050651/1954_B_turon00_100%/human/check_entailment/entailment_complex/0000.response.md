Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. However, the logic implemented in the program does not correctly address the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Consecutive Elements**:
   - The program initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and then counts the number of consecutive elements that are the same as `tmp`. This approach is flawed because it only considers the first element and does not account for the possibility of other patterns that could make the array beautiful.
   - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will count the number of consecutive `1`s, which is 3, and output 1. However, the correct answer should be 1 because removing the last `1` will make the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.

2. **Handling of All Elements Being the Same**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by checking if `ans == n` and printing `-1`. However, it fails to handle other cases where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same.

3. **General Approach**:
   - The problem requires identifying the minimum number of elements to remove to break the "beautiful" property, which is defined by the ability to make all elements the same using the specified operations. The program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to achieve this.

4. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the test case `[2, 2, 2]`, the program correctly outputs `-1` because it is impossible to make the array not beautiful.
   - For the test case `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program outputs `1`, which is correct.
   - For the test case `[1]`, the program correctly outputs `-1` because the array has only one element.
   - For the test case `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program outputs `3`, which is correct.

However, the program's logic is not general enough to handle all possible beautiful arrays. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]`. The program will output `3`, but the correct answer should be `2` (removing the `3` and one of the `2`s).

Given these issues, the program is not correct for the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
