Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input and output through standard output, as it does not have any parameters defined. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. The value of `t` is now the integer input provided by the user. Each test case starts with a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) followed by a line containing `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), forming a beautiful array. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
