Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. The logic in the program, however, does not correctly address the problem. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Logic to Determine Minimum Removals**:
   - The program initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp` and storing the minimum count in `ans`.
   - After the loop, it checks if the array has only one element or if all elements are the same. If so, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints `ans`.

3. **Flaws in the Logic**:
   - The program only considers the first element of the array (`a[0]`) and counts consecutive elements that are equal to it. This does not account for the possibility that the array might have different elements that can be made non-beautiful by removing a different set of elements.
   - The problem requires making the array non-beautiful by removing elements, but the program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to achieve this. It only finds the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is not the correct approach.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To make the array non-beautiful, we need to ensure that there is no index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) such that `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced with `a[i-1]`.
   - One way to achieve this is to identify the longest subarray where all elements are the same and remove elements to break this pattern. If the array has only one element or all elements are the same, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful, and we should output `-1`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the problem of making the array non-beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
