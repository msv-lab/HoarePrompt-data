The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters based on the given function signature. However, it is implied that the function will process multiple test cases, each consisting of three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`. The function will handle `t` test cases, where `1 <= t <= 1000`.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Since the specific output conditions are not provided, we can only describe the general behavior of the function in handling these test cases.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.**
