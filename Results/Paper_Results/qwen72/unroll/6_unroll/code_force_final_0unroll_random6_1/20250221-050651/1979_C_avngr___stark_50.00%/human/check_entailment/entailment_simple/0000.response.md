### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculating the Product**:
   - The program calculates the product `m` of all elements in the list `k`. This is done to find a common multiple of all multipliers, which is used to ensure that the bets are integers.

3. **Calculating Bets**:
   - The program then calculates the bets `c` for each outcome by dividing `m` by each multiplier `k[i]`. This ensures that the total number of coins bet is a multiple of the multipliers.

4. **Finding the GCD**:
   - The program uses the `func_1` function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c`. This is done to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the required conditions.

5. **Checking the Condition**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the bets `c` is less than `m / hcf`. If it is, the program prints the bets. If not, it prints `-1`.

6. **Output**:
   - The output is correctly formatted as required by the problem statement.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the GCD Calculation**:
  - The GCD calculation is correct and ensures that the bets are reduced to the smallest possible values while maintaining the integer property.

- **Correctness of the Bets**:
  - The bets `c` are calculated as `m / k[i]`, which ensures that the total number of coins bet is a multiple of the multipliers. This is a valid approach to ensure that the bets are integers and that the total sum of bets is minimized.

- **Condition Check**:
  - The condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` is the correct way to check if the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. If this condition is not met, the program correctly outputs `-1`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases such as when all multipliers are the same (e.g., `5 5 5 5 5`), where it correctly outputs `-1` because it is impossible to distribute the coins in such a way that the total bet is less than the return for any outcome.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output correctly, and the condition checks are appropriate.

### Correctness:
**True**
