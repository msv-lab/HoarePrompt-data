Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires distributing coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is less than the return from any single winning outcome. The return from a winning outcome is the bet on that outcome multiplied by its multiplier `k_i`.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `m`.
   - It then calculates the bet for each outcome as `m / k[i]`.
   - It finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all these bets using `func_1`.
   - It reduces each bet by dividing by the GCD.
   - It checks if the sum of the reduced bets is less than `m / hcf`. If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Product Calculation**: The product `m` of all multipliers is calculated correctly.
   - **Bet Calculation**: The bet for each outcome `c[i]` is calculated as `m / k[i]`, which ensures that the return from any winning outcome is `m`.
   - **GCD Calculation**: The GCD of all bets is calculated using `func_1`, which is correct.
   - **Reduction and Sum Check**: The bets are reduced by dividing by the GCD, and the sum of the reduced bets is checked against `m / hcf`. This ensures that the total bet is minimized while still satisfying the condition that the total bet is less than the return from any winning outcome.
   - **Output**: If the sum of the reduced bets is less than `m / hcf`, the program prints the reduced bets. Otherwise, it prints `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Outcome**: If `n = 1`, the program will correctly output `-1` because there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total bet is less than the return.
   - **Equal Multipliers**: If all multipliers are equal, the program will correctly output `-1` because the total bet will be equal to the return, not less.
   - **Multiple Outcomes**: For multiple outcomes with different multipliers, the program will find a valid distribution of coins if one exists.

5. **Mathematical Validity**:
   - The product `m` of all multipliers ensures that the return from any winning outcome is `m`.
   - Dividing each bet by the GCD reduces the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the condition that the return is `m`.
   - The sum check ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the return from any winning outcome.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
