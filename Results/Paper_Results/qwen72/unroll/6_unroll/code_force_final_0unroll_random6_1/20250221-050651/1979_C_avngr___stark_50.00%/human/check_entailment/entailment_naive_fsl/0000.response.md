Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same. According to the problem description, if all multipliers are the same, there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. However, the program does not correctly identify this case and outputs a distribution of coins instead of \(-1\).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
The program will output:
```
1 1 1 1 1
```
However, the correct output should be \(-1\) because if all multipliers are the same, the total amount of coins bet will always be equal to the amount received back for any winning outcome, which does not satisfy the condition that the total amount of coins bet must be strictly less.
