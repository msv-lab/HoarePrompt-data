#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of outcomes, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. k is a list of n integers representing the multipliers for each outcome, where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in the list `k`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in the list `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in the list. The original list `numbers` remains unchanged after the function call.
