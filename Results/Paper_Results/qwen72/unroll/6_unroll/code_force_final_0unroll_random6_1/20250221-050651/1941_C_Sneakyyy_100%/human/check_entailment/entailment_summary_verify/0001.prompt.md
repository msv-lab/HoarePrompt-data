You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It then counts the number of occurrences of the substrings "map" or "pie" in the string `s`. After processing all test cases, it prints the count of these substrings for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `a`.

2. **Loop to Find Substrings**:
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through the string `a` with an index `i`.
   - The loop condition `i < len(a) - 2` ensures that the program only checks substrings of length 3 that can fit within the remaining part of the string.

3. **Substring Check**:
   - Inside the loop, the program extracts a substring `s` of length 3 starting from index `i`.
   - It checks if the substring `s` is either "map" or "pie".
   - If the substring is one of these, it increments `i` by 3 to skip the next two characters and increments `ans` by 1 to count the removal of one character.
   - If the substring is not "map" or "pie", it increments `i` by 1 to move to the next character.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing the string, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

### Issues:
- **Incrementing `ans` by 1**: The program increments `ans` by 1 when it finds a substring "map" or "pie". However, this is incorrect because removing one character from "map" or "pie" will not necessarily make the string beautiful. Instead, it should increment `ans` by 2, as removing two characters is the minimum required to eliminate the substring "map" or "pie".

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 2  # Corrected: Increment by 2 instead of 1
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect because it increments `ans` by 1 instead of 2 when it finds a substring "map" or "pie".
- The corrected program increments `ans` by 2, which is the correct approach to ensure the string becomes beautiful.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
