Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 2x2 icons is such that they can be placed on a single screen, but the remaining 1x1 icons cannot fill the remaining space on that screen. For example, consider the input where `x = 1` and `y = 3`. According to the problem, the minimum number of screens required should be 2, because one screen can accommodate three 2x2 icons, and the remaining 1x1 icon will need a new screen. However, the program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons as 2 (since `y // 2 + 1` for `y = 3`), and then checks if the 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining cells of these 2 screens. Since the remaining cells in the second screen are more than 1, the program will output 2, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 3, as the 1x1 icon cannot fit in the remaining space of the second screen without overlapping or leaving the screen.
