Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to fit all the icons. The logic for calculating the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons and the remaining cells is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that 2x2 icons always require a full screen or half a screen, which is not necessarily the case. 

A 2x2 icon can be placed on a screen with other 1x1 icons, and the program should consider how to optimally place both types of icons on the same screen to minimize the total number of screens used. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Each screen has 15 cells (5x3)
        screen_cells = 15
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_y = (y * 4 + screen_cells - 1) // screen_cells
        # Calculate the remaining space on these screens
        remaining_cells = screens_for_y * screen_cells - y * 4
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons
        extra_screens_for_x = (x - remaining_cells + screen_cells - 1) // screen_cells
        # Total number of screens required
        total_screens = screens_for_y + extra_screens_for_x
        result.append(total_screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required by first determining how many screens are needed for the 2x2 icons and then using the remaining space on those screens to fit as many 1x1 icons as possible. If there are still 1x1 icons left, it calculates the additional screens needed for them.
