The function `func` accepts no parameters directly in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function will process `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of these test cases, it will handle two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. The function's output is not specified, so it is unclear what the function returns. However, given the context, it is likely that the function will return some result based on the values of `x` and `y` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000. For each test case, it handles two integers `x` and `y`, both between 0 and 99. The function returns a result based on the values of `x` and `y` for each test case.**
