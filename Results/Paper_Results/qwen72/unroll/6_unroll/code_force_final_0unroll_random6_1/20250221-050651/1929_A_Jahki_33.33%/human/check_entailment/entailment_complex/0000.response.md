Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is strictly increasing.
   - If the array is strictly increasing, it returns `True`.
   - If the array is not strictly increasing, it returns `False`.

3. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the program prints `0` because the beauty of a strictly increasing array is zero (since \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\) will be positive, and the sum of these differences will be the difference between the last and the first element, which is not the maximum beauty).
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - The beauty is calculated as \( (b_2 - b_1) + (b_3 - b_2) + \ldots + (b_n - b_{n-1}) \), where `b` is the sorted array. This is equivalent to the difference between the last and the first element of the sorted array, which is the maximum possible beauty.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the beauty for each test case.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The function `func_1` is checking if the array is strictly increasing, but this is not necessary for the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty, which is always achieved by sorting the array and calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements. Therefore, the function `func_1` should not be used, and the program should directly sort the array and calculate the beauty.

Corrected Program:
```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    beauty = 0
    b = sorted(a)
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

Given the original program and the problem description, the original program is incorrect because it unnecessarily checks if the array is strictly increasing and prints `0` in that case, which is not always the correct output.

Correctness: **False**
