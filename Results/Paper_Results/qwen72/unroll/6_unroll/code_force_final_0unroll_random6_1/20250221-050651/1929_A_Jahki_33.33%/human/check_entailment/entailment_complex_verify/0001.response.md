### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can help achieve this maximum beauty.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the array elements \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\).

3. **Array Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the array \(a\) in ascending order. This is a crucial step because the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order.
   - The sorted array ensures that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are minimized for each pair of consecutive elements, but the sum of these differences is maximized.

4. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the beauty by summing the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - This is done using a loop that iterates from 1 to \(n-1\) and adds the difference \(b[x] - b[x-1]\) to the `beauty` variable.
   - The calculation is correct and follows the problem's definition of beauty.

5. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, the beauty is 0, and the program prints 0.
   - However, this check is not necessary because the beauty of a sorted array is always the same, and the program can directly calculate the beauty without this check.
   - The function `func_1` can be removed to simplify the code, but its presence does not affect the correctness of the program.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.
   - The output is correct for the given test cases.

### Issues:
- **Unnecessary Function**:
  - The function `func_1` is unnecessary. The beauty of a sorted array is always the same, and the program can directly calculate it without checking if the array is already sorted.
  - This function can be removed to simplify the code, but its presence does not affect the correctness of the program.

- **Edge Case**:
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where all elements are the same (e.g., the second test case with all elements being 69).
  - The beauty of such an array is 0, which is correctly calculated and printed.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation. The unnecessary function `func_1` can be removed to simplify the code, but its presence does not affect the correctness of the program. The program correctly sorts the array and calculates the maximum beauty as required by the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.
