### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can help achieve this maximum beauty.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the array elements \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\).

3. **Array Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the array \(a\) in ascending order. This is a crucial step because the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order.
   - The sorted array ensures that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are minimized for each pair of consecutive elements, but the sum of these differences is maximized.

4. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the beauty by summing the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - This is done using a loop that iterates from 1 to \(n-1\) and adds the difference \(b[x] - b[x-1]\) to the `beauty` variable.
   - The calculation is correct and follows the problem's definition.

5. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, the program prints 0. However, this is incorrect. The beauty of a sorted array is not necessarily 0; it is the sum of the differences of consecutive elements.
   - The function `func_1` is unnecessary because the beauty of a sorted array is always the same, and the program can directly calculate it without this check.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.
   - The output is correct for the given test cases, but the logic for handling already sorted arrays is flawed.

### Issues:
- **Unnecessary Function**:
  - The function `func_1` is unnecessary and can be removed to simplify the code.
  - The beauty of a sorted array is always the same, and the program can directly calculate it without checking if the array is already sorted.
  - The function `func_1` incorrectly returns 0 for already sorted arrays, which is not the correct beauty value.

### Corrected Code:
```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    beauty = 0
    b = sorted(a)
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the unnecessary `func_1` function and its incorrect handling of already sorted arrays. The logic for sorting and calculating the beauty is correct, but the special case handling is flawed. By removing the `func_1` function and directly calculating the beauty, the program can be made correct.

### Correctness:
Final: **False** (The program is incorrect due to the flawed special case handling and the unnecessary function.)
