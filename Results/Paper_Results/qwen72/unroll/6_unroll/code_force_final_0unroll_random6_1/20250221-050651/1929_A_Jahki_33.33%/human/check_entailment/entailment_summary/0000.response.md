### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second element to the last.
   - The maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order because the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements `a`.
   - It then checks if the array `a` is already strictly increasing using the function `func_1`.
   - If `a` is strictly increasing, it prints `0` (since the beauty of a strictly increasing array is the sum of positive differences, which is already maximized).
   - If `a` is not strictly increasing, it sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` checks if the array `a` is strictly increasing.
   - It iterates through the array and increments `order` if the current element is not greater than the previous element.
   - If `order` is `0` after the loop, it returns `True` (indicating the array is strictly increasing). Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic correctly sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - However, the condition to print `0` when the array is already strictly increasing is incorrect. The beauty of a strictly increasing array is not necessarily `0`. The beauty should be calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which is the same as the beauty of the sorted array.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program's logic for calculating the beauty of the array is correct when the array is not strictly increasing.
   - The condition to print `0` when the array is strictly increasing is incorrect and should be removed. The beauty should always be calculated by sorting the array and summing the differences.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it prints `0` for strictly increasing arrays, which is not the correct beauty value. The beauty should be calculated by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements, regardless of whether the array is initially strictly increasing or not.
