Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000; `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, where each element in `a` and `b` is between 1 and 10^9, inclusive; `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Natural Language: The variable `c` is created as a list of integers, where each element `c[i]` is the minimum value between the corresponding elements `a[i]` and `b[i]` from the lists `a` and `b`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
