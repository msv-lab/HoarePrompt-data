### Reasoning:

The program is intended to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in line. The logic of the program can be broken down as follows:

1. **Initialization**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of people in the queue excluding Kirill) and `m` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill).
    - It also reads two lists of integers `a` and `b` of length `n`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
    - The function calculates a new list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This represents the minimum cost to move the person at position `i` to a position ahead of Kirill.
    - It then calculates a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`. This helps in calculating the total cost of moving people starting from any position `i` to the end of the queue.
    - The function initializes `ans` to infinity, which will store the minimum cost.
    - It then iterates over the first `m` positions (0 to `m-1`), and for each position `i`, it calculates the cost as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`. This represents the cost of bribing the person at position `i` to move ahead of Kirill, plus the cost of moving all subsequent people starting from position `i+1` to the end of the queue.
    - The minimum value among these costs is stored in `ans`.
    - Finally, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people.

### Analysis:

The logic of the program seems correct based on the problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic for the first example in the input:

- **Input**:
    ```
    4 2
    7 3 6 9
    4 3 8 5
    ```
- **Computation**:
    - `c = [min(7, 4), min(3, 3), min(6, 8), min(9, 5)] = [4, 3, 6, 5]`
    - `suff = [4 + 3 + 6 + 5, 3 + 6 + 5, 6 + 5, 5, 0] = [18, 14, 11, 5, 0]`
    - For `i = 0`, `ans = min(inf, 7 + 14) = 21`
    - For `i = 1`, `ans = min(21, 3 + 11) = 14`
    - The final `ans` is `14`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly computes the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend based on the given problem constraints and logic. Therefore, the program is correct.
