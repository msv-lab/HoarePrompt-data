#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000. a and b are lists of integers of length n, where each element in a and b is between 1 and 10^9, inclusive. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 200,000`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` to `c[n-1]` for `0 <= i < n` and `suff[n]` remains 0, `i` is -1.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 200,000`; `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`; `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`; `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` to `c[n-1]` for `0 <= i < n` and `suff[n]` remains 0; `i` is `k-1`; `ans` is the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: two integers `n` and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b` of length `n`. It computes and prints the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`, where `suff[i]` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` from index `i` to `n-1`.
