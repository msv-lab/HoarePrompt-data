### Reasoning

Let's revisit the logic and verify the correctness of the provided program step by step, especially focusing on the formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Odd Total Points Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is impossible due to the point distribution rules (each game results in an even number of points: 0+2, 1+1, or 2+0).
   - This logic is correct.

2. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
     \]
   - Let's break down the formula:
     - **Total Points**: \( v[0] + v[1] + v[2] \) represents the total points scored by all three players.
     - **Max Draw Points**: \( \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]) \) represents the points that cannot be attributed to draws alone. This is because if \( v[2] - v[0] - v[1] > 0 \), it indicates that the highest score player has more points than the sum of the other two players, which means some of these points must be from wins rather than draws.
     - **Maximum Draws**: The formula effectively calculates the number of draws by subtracting the points that must be from wins from the total points and then dividing by 2 (since each draw contributes 2 points in total).

#### Testing with Example Cases

Let's verify the program with the provided example cases:

1. **Input**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: `0` (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \frac{0 - \max(0, 0 - 0 - 0)}{2} = \frac{0 - 0}{2} = 0 \)
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Input**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: `2` (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \frac{2 - \max(0, 1 - 0 - 1)}{2} = \frac{2 - 0}{2} = 1 \)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: `3` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Input**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: `4` (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \frac{4 - \max(0, 2 - 1 - 1)}{2} = \frac{4 - 0}{2} = 2 \)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Input**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: `9` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Input**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: `12` (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \frac{12 - \max(0, 5 - 3 - 4)}{2} = \frac{12 - 0}{2} = 6 \)
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Input**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: `12` (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \frac{12 - \max(0, 10 - 1 - 1)}{2} = \frac{12 - 8}{2} = 2 \)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

All the example cases match the expected outputs, and the logic appears to be correctly implemented.

### Additional Consideration

To further ensure correctness, let's consider a few more edge cases:

- **Input**: `0 2 2`
  - Total points: `4` (even)
  - Maximum draws: \( \frac{4 - \max(0, 2 - 0 - 2)}{2} = \frac{4 - 0}{2} = 2 \)
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Input**: `2 2 6`
  - Total points: `10` (even)
  - Maximum draws: \( \frac{10 - \max(0, 6 - 2 - 2)}{2} = \frac{10 - 2}{2} = 4 \)
  - Output: `4` (Correct)

These edge cases also confirm the correctness of the formula.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the provided example cases and adheres to the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies impossible score distributions and calculates the maximum number of draws for valid score distributions.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identify inconsistent scores for all valid inputs.
