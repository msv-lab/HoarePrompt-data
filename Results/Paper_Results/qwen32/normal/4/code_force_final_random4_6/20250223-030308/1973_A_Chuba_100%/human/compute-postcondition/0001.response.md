In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and `t`. The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are mentioned as part of the state before the loop starts but are not part of the loop head, so they cannot be directly adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, the variable `t` must be at least 1, as the loop will iterate `t` times. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate over the range and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure that the loop executes.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
