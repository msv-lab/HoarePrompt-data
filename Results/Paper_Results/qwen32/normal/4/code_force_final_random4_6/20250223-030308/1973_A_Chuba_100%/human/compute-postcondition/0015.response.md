The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, so `t` should be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd, then no further changes are made. Otherwise, `result` is calculated as `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.**
