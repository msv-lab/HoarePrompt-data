### Reasoning:
The program calculates the maximum number of draws based on the scores of three players in a series of chess games. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players. These scores are guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order.

2. **Sum of Scores Check**: The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total score if each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2-0 or 1-1).

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**: If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3) - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)}{2}
   \]
   This formula works as follows:
   - The total points distributed in all games is `p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - The term `max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)` accounts for the minimum points that `p3` must have earned from games against `p1` and `p2` (i.e., `p3` could not have earned more points from games against `p1` and `p2` than their combined scores).
   - Subtracting this term from the total points gives the points that could have come from draws.
   - Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws because each draw contributes 2 points in total.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated `result` for each test case or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

### Verification:
Let's verify the given examples to ensure the program works correctly:

1. **Example 1**: `0 0 0`
   - Sum is `0`, which is even.
   - No draws are possible since no games were played.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**: `0 1 1`
   - Sum is `2`, which is even.
   - Maximum draws = `(0 + 1 + 1 - max(0, 1 - 0 - 1)) // 2 = 2 // 2 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**: `1 1 1`
   - Sum is `3`, which is odd.
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Example 4**: `1 1 2`
   - Sum is `4`, which is even.
   - Maximum draws = `(1 + 1 + 2 - max(0, 2 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 4 // 2 = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Example 5**: `3 3 3`
   - Sum is `9`, which is odd.
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Example 6**: `3 4 5`
   - Sum is `12`, which is even.
   - Maximum draws = `(3 + 4 + 5 - max(0, 5 - 3 - 4)) // 2 = 12 // 2 = 6`
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Example 7**: `1 1 10`
   - Sum is `12`, which is even.
   - Maximum draws = `(1 + 1 + 10 - max(0, 10 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2 // 2 = 1`
   - However, this case is incorrect. The correct calculation should be:
     - Maximum draws = `(1 + 1 + 10 - max(0, 10 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = (12 - 8) // 2 = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws or determines if the scores are inconsistent based on the given logic and examples.

### Correctness: **True**
