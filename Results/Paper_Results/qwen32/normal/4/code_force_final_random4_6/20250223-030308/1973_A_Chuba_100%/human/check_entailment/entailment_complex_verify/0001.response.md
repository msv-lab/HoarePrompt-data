### Reasoning:
Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the annotated code and the original assessment.

1. **Input Handling and Total Points Check**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the scores for each test case.
   - It checks if the total points (sum of scores) are even. If not, it correctly outputs `-1` because an odd total is impossible under the given rules.

2. **Formula for Maximum Draws**:
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
     \]
   - This formula attempts to maximize the number of draws by adjusting for the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores. The term \(\max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])\) effectively ensures that the highest score does not exceed the sum of the other two scores plus the number of draws.

3. **Verification with Examples**:
   - **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0`
     - Total points: 0 (even)
     - Maximum draws: 0 (no games played)
     - Output: `0` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1`
     - Total points: 2 (even)
     - Maximum draws: 1 (one draw between the second and third player)
     - Output: `1` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1`
     - Total points: 3 (odd)
     - Output: `-1` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2`
     - Total points: 4 (even)
     - Maximum draws: 2 (one draw between the first and second player, one draw between the second and third player)
     - Output: `2` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3`
     - Total points: 9 (odd)
     - Output: `-1` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5`
     - Total points: 12 (even)
     - Maximum draws: 6 (all games could be draws)
     - Output: `6` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10`
     - Total points: 12 (even)
     - Maximum draws: 2 (one draw between the first and second player, one draw between the second and third player)
     - Output: `2` (Correct)

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where no games are played (`0 0 0`) and outputs `0` for draws.
   - It correctly identifies invalid score distributions that result in an odd total and outputs `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and adheres to the problem constraints. The logic and formula used are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
