You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integer scores in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it prints either `-1` if the sum of the scores is odd, or a calculated value representing half the sum of the scores minus the maximum of zero or the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the logic of the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players. The scores are provided in non-decreasing order, i.e., \(p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3\).

### Key Points:
1. **Total Points**: The total points scored by all three players must be even because each game results in a total of 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1).
2. **Maximum Draws**: To maximize the number of draws, we should minimize the number of 2-0 outcomes. The formula used in the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws.
3. **Invalid Scores**: If the total points are odd, it's impossible to achieve such scores with the given rules, hence the output should be -1.

### Program Logic:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the three scores.
2. **Odd Total Points Check**: If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total points with the given rules.
3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**: The formula used is:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
   \]
   This formula ensures that we maximize the number of draws by adjusting for the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: 0 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 0 (no games played)
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: 2 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 1 (one draw between the second and third player)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: 3 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: 4 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 2 (one draw between the first and second player, one draw between the second and third player)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: 9 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 6 (all games could be draws)
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 2 (one draw between the first and second player, one draw between the second and third player)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and adheres to the problem constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
