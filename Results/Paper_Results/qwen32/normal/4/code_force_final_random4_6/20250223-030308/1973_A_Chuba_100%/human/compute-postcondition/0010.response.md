The provided code snippet only updates the variable `v` by reading a list of integers from the input. It does not affect `t` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `v` now holds the new list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
