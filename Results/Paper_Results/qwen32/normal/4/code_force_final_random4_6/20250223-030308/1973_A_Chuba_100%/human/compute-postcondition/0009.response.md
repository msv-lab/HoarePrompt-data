The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be decreased by 1 and still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd, then the program does nothing further in the if part. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is even, then `result` is set to `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`**.
