Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. It processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 500. For each test case, the function returns a value indicating the result based on the scores provided.**
