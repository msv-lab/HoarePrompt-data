Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0; `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd, then the program does nothing further in the if part. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is even, then `result` is set to `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.**
