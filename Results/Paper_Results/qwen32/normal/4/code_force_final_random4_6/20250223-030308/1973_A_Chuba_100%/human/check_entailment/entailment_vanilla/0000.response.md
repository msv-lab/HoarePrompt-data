Let's break down the logic of the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players. The scores are provided in non-decreasing order, i.e., \(p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3\).

### Key Points:
1. **Total Points**: The total points scored by all three players must be even because each game results in a total of 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1).
2. **Maximum Draws**: To maximize the number of draws, we should minimize the number of 2-0 outcomes. The formula used in the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws.
3. **Invalid Scores**: If the total points are odd, it's impossible to achieve such scores with the given rules, hence the output should be -1.

### Program Logic:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the three scores.
2. **Odd Total Points Check**: If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total points with the given rules.
3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**: The formula used is:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
   \]
   This formula ensures that we maximize the number of draws by adjusting for the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: 0 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 0 (no games played)
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: 2 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 1 (one draw between the second and third player)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: 3 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: 4 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 2 (one draw between the first and second player, one draw between the second and third player)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: 9 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 6 (all games could be draws)
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 2 (one draw between the first and second player, one draw between the second and third player)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and adheres to the problem constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
