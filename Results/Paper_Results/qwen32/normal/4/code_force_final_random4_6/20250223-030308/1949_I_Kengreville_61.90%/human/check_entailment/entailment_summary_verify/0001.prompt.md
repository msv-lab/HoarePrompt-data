You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search starting from a given disk index `i` to identify all disks that are part of the same connected component. It updates the `visited` list to mark these disks as visited, appends their indices to the `nodes` list, and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists for these disks based on their radii and positions.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii of the disks such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency between disks that were originally tangent.

#### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes arrays to store the x and y coordinates (`x`, `y`), the radii (`r`), and a visited flag (`visited`) for each disk.
   - It also initializes arrays `coef0` and `coef1` which are used to keep track of the coefficients in a system of equations.
   - A list `nodes` is used to keep track of the nodes (disks) in the current connected component during the DFS traversal.

2. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of disks `n` and then reads the center coordinates and radius for each disk.

3. **DFS Traversal:**
   - The program performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all disks that are connected through tangency.
   - For each disk `i`, if it has not been visited, the program initializes its coefficients (`coef0[i]` and `coef1[i]`) and starts a DFS traversal from that disk.
   - During the DFS, for each disk `j` that is tangent to the current disk `i` and has not been visited, the program updates the coefficients of disk `j` based on the tangency condition and recursively visits disk `j`.

4. **Checking Conditions:**
   - After the DFS traversal of a connected component, the program sums up the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for all disks in the component.
   - If the sum of `coef1` for any connected component is not zero, it sets `ok` to `True` indicating that it is possible to adjust the radii to meet the conditions.
   - Finally, the program prints "YES" if `ok` is `True` and "NO" otherwise.

#### Issues in the Code:

- **Global Variables:**
  - The variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` are used within the functions `func_1` and `dfs` without being declared as global. This will lead to an error because Python treats these variables as local unless explicitly declared as global.

- **DFS Function:**
  - The `dfs` function is defined outside of `func_1` but relies on variables defined in `func_1`. This is problematic and will cause a `NameError` because `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` are not accessible within `dfs`.

- **Logic for Adjusting Radii:**
  - The logic for determining if it is possible to adjust the radii is based on the sum of coefficients `coef1` for each connected component. However, the explanation provided in the code comments does not clearly indicate why this condition is sufficient to determine if the radii can be adjusted as required.

- **Handling Overlapping Disks:**
  - The problem statement specifies that no two disks overlap in a region of positive area, but the code does not explicitly handle or check for this condition. However, since the problem guarantees that disks do not overlap, this is not a critical issue.

### Conclusion:

The program contains several issues, primarily related to the handling of global and local variables and the logic for determining if the radii can be adjusted. These issues need to be addressed for the program to be correct.

### Correctness: **False**
