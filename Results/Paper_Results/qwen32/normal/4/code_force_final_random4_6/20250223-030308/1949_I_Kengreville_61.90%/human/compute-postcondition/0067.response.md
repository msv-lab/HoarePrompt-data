The provided code snippet is `c1 += coef1[j]`. This implies that the value of `c1` will be updated by adding the value of `coef1[j]` to it. However, the value of `j` is not specified in the initial state or the code snippet, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `c1` without knowing what `j` is. We can only express the new value of `c1` in terms of its previous value and `coef1[j]`.

Given the initial state, the output state will retain all the information provided, with the only change being the updated value of `c1`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` and `visited[2]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[2]` is updated to some value, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[2]` is updated to some value, `nodes` is a list containing the integers `2` and `3`, `i` is 2, `c0` is `2 * coef0[j]`, `c1` is `c1` + `coef1[2]` + `coef1[j]`, and `ok` is `True`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `c1` is now the previous value of `c1` plus `coef1[2]` plus `coef1[j]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
