The given code snippet is `c1 += coef1[j]`. However, the variable `j` is not defined in the initial state or provided in the code snippet. Since `j` is not defined, we cannot determine its value or the effect of the operation on `c1`. Assuming `j` is intended to be `i` (as `i` is the only index variable mentioned in the initial state), we can proceed with that assumption.

Given `i` is 1, and `coef1[1]` is 1, the operation `c1 += coef1[j]` (assuming `j` is `i`) results in `c1` being incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` and `visited[1]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[1]` which is `0`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[1]` which is `1`, `nodes` is a list containing the integer `1`, `i` is 1, `c0` is `0`, `c1` is `1`.**
