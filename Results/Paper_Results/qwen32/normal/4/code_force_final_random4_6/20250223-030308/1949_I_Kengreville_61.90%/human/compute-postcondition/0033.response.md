To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables `c0` and `c1` are updated based on the elements in the `nodes` list.

Given the loop:
```python
for j in nodes:
    c0 += coef0[j]
    c1 += coef1[j]
```
The loop iterates over each element `j` in the `nodes` list and updates `c0` and `c1` by adding `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` respectively.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `c0` is updated to `c0 + coef0[j]` and `c1` is updated to `c1 + coef1[j]`.
- After 2 iterations: `c0` is updated to `c0 + coef0[j1] + coef0[j2]` and `c1` is updated to `c1 + coef1[j1] + coef1[j2]`, where `j1` and `j2` are the first and second elements in `nodes`.
- After 3 iterations: `c0` is updated to `c0 + coef0[j1] + coef0[j2] + coef0[j3]` and `c1` is updated to `c1 + coef1[j1] + coef1[j2] + coef1[j3]`, where `j1`, `j2`, and `j3` are the first, second, and third elements in `nodes`.

Thus, after all iterations, `c0` and `c1` will be the sum of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`.

The final output state after all iterations is:
- `c0` will be the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`.
- `c1` will be the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`.

Let's denote the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes` as `sum_coef0` and the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes` as `sum_coef1`.

Output State: **`c0` is `sum_coef0`, `c1` is `sum_coef1`, all other variables remain unchanged.**

In natural language: After all iterations, `c0` is the total sum of the values in `coef0` for all indices in `nodes`, and `c1` is the total sum of the values in `coef1` for all indices in `nodes`. All other variables remain in their initial state as described in the precondition.
