Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `nodes` is an empty list, `i` is 1. If `visited[1]` is `True`, then `visited[1]` is `True`, `coef0[1]` is `0`, `coef1[1]` is `1`, `nodes` contains the integer `1`, `c0` is `0`, `c1` is `1`, and `ok` is `True`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, `c0`, `c1`, or `ok`.**
