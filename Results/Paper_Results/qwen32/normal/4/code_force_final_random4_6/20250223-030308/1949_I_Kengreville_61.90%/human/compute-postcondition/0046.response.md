The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `nodes`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes` list. If there are more elements in the `nodes` list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nodes` contains the integer `1` and `j` is `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nodes` must contain at least one more element.

Let's assume the next element in `nodes` is `2` for the next iteration. Therefore, `nodes` should be `[1, 2]` and `j` should be `2` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` and `visited[1]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[1]` which is `0`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[1]` which is `1`, `nodes` is a list containing the integers `[1, 2]`, `i` is 1, `c0` is `0`, `c1` is `1`, `j` is `2`**
