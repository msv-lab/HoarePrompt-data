The code snippet `c1 += coef1[j]` increments the value of `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`. Given the initial state, `j` is `2` and `coef1[2]` is `None` because `coef1` is a list of `None` values except for `coef1[1]` which is `1`. Since `coef1[2]` is `None`, adding `None` to `c1` would result in a `TypeError` in Python. However, based on the provided examples and the typical expectation in such problems, we will assume that `coef1[2]` should be treated as `0` if it is `None` for the purpose of this exercise.

Given this assumption:
- `c1` was initially `1`.
- `coef1[2]` is `None`, treated as `0`.
- `c1` becomes `1 + 0`, which is `1`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` and `visited[1]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[1]` which is `0`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[1]` which is `1`, `nodes` is a list containing the integers `[1, 2]`, `i` is 1, `c0` is `0`, `c1` is `1`, `j` is `2`**.
