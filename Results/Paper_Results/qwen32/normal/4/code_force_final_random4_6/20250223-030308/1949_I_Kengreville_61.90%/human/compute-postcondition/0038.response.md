The code snippet assigns the value `1` to `coef1[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `1`. Therefore, `coef1[1]` is updated to `1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `n` must still be greater than 1, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `nodes`, and `i` retain their initial values. There are no changes to `c0`, `c1`, or `ok` because the condition `visited[i]` is not evaluated or used in this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[1]` which is `0`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[1]` which is `1`, `nodes` is an empty list, `i` is 1.**
