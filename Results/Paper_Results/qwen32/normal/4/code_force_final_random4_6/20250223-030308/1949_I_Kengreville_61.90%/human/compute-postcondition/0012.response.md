`dx` is assigned the value of `x[i] - x[j]`. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `j` are provided in the initial state. Since `visited[i]` is True and `j` is incremented by 1, the specific values of `x[i]` and `x[j]` are used to compute `dx`. The values of `y`, `r`, and `visited` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively; `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited, and now `visited[i]` is True; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`.**
