The code snippet `r = a[i + 1]` assigns the value of the element at index `i + 1` in the list `a` to the variable `r`. Given the initial state, `a` is a sorted list of integers, and `i` is initially 1. Therefore, `r` will be updated to the value of the second element in the list `a` (since Python uses 0-based indexing).

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the updated state is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `r` is `a[1]`. Additionally, `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`.**
