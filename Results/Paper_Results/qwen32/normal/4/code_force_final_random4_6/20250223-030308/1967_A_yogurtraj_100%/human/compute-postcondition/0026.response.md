Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is either 0 or `n - 2`, `i` is 1, and `k` is either 0 or decreased by `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `y` is set to `n - 2`, `r` is set to `a[1]`, and `k` is set to 0. Otherwise, `y` remains 0, `k` is decreased by `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, and `r` is set to `a[2]`.**
