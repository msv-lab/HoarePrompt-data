Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is 4. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `r` is set to `a[4]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 5`, and `k` is 0, with the most internal loop or if statement being broken out of. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by `5 * (a[5] - a[4])`, and `r` is set to `a[5]`.**
