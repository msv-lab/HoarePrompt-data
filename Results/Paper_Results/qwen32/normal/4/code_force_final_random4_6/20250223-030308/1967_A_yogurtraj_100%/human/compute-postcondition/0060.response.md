Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0 or `n - 2`, and `r` is `a[1]` or `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is 0, `rem` is `0 % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 2`, and `r` is `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `r` is `a[1]`.**
