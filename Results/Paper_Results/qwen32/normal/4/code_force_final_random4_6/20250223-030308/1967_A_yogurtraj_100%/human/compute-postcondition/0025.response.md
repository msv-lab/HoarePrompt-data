The code snippet assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. Given that `i` is 1, `r` will be assigned the value of `a[2]` (the third element in the sorted list `a`, since list indices start at 0).

Here's the updated state of the variables after the execution of the code:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `ii` remains 0.
- `n` remains the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1.
- `a` remains a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `rem` remains 0.
- `y` remains 0.
- `i` remains 1.
- `k` is decreased by `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.
- `r` is assigned the value of `a[2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` is decreased by `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is `a[2]`.**
