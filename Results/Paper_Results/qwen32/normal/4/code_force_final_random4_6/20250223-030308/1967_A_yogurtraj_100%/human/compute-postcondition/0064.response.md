The variable `y` is updated to `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` is 2, the new value of `y` becomes `n - 1 - 2`, which simplifies to `n - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is `k % 3`, `y` is `n - 3`, `i` is 2, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`.**
