Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is 0, and the current value of `i` satisfies the condition ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k)**

In natural language, the value of `rem` has been updated to be `k % (i + 1)`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
