The code snippet provided updates the value of the variable `rem` based on the modulus operation between `k` and `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the expression `i + 1` evaluates to 2. Therefore, `rem` is assigned the value of `k % 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is `k % 2`, `y` is 0, `i` is 1, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`.**
