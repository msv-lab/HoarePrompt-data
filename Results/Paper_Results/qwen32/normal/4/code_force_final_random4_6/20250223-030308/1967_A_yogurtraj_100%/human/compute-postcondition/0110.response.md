The value of `k` is adjusted by subtracting the product of `(i + 1)` and the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`. Given the initial values, `i` is 3, so the expression `(i + 1)` evaluates to 4. Therefore, `k` is reduced by `4 * (a[4] - a[3])`. The values of `t`, `ii`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is 3, `k` is reduced by `4 * (a[4] - a[3])`.**
