The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on these variables.

The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, which means `n` must be at least 2. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `n` is at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `r` is `a[0]`**
