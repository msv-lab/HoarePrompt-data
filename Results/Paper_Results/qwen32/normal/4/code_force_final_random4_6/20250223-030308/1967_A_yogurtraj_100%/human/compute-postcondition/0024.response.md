To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

The code snippet is:
```
k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `ii` is 0
- `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input
- `rem` is 0
- `y` is 0
- `i` is 1

The code modifies the value of `k` by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from it. Let's break down the expression:
- `i + 1` is `2` because `i` is `1`.
- `a[i + 1] - a[i]` is `a[2] - a[1]` because `i` is `1`.

Thus, the expression becomes:
```
k -= 2 * (a[2] - a[1])
```

This means `k` is decreased by `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.

The other variables (`t`, `ii`, `n`, `a`, `rem`, `y`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` is decreased by `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.**
