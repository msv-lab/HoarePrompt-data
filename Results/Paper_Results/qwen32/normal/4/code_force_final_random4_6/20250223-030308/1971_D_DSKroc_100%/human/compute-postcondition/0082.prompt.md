Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, and for each test case, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 0
    flag = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
            count += 1
        if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
            flag = 1
    if flag == 0:
        print(count + 1)
    else:
        print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `count` is the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s`, and `flag` is 0 if there is no '0' followed by a '1' in the string `s`, otherwise `flag` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. `s` remains unchanged as it is only being read, not modified. `count` will be the total number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s`. `flag` will be 1 if there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1' in the string `s`; otherwise, it will be 0. `q` is incremented by 1 as stated in the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains unchanged, `s` is the input string, `count` is the number of transitions where consecutive characters are different, `flag` indicates whether there is at least one increasing pair of consecutive characters (0 if no such pair exists, 1 if at least one exists), and `q` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
