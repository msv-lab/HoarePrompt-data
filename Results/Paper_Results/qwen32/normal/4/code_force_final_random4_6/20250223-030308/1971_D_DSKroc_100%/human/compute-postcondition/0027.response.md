Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `count` is the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s`, and `flag` is 0 if there is no '0' followed by a '1' in the string `s`, otherwise `flag` is 1.**
