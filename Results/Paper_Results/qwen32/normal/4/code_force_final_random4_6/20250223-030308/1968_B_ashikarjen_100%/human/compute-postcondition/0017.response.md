The code provided is a `break` statement, which will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is contained within. Since the `break` statement does not affect any variables directly, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `k` remain unchanged; `j` is equal to `m` because there is no index `j` such that `b[j] == a[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
