The variables in the loop head are `j`, `m`, `b[j]`, and `a[i]`. However, since `a` remains unchanged and `i` is already specified as 1, we only need to consider adjusting `j`, `m`, `b[j]`, and `a[1]`.

According to the loop condition `while j < m and b[j] != a[i]`, for the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `j` must be less than `m`.
2. `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t`, `n`, `m` must be greater than 1.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 2.
- `b[1]` is not equal to `a[1]`.

Since `j` is currently 2, `m` must be greater than 2 to satisfy `j < m`. Additionally, `b[j]` (which is `b[2]`) must not be equal to `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `j` is 2.
- `m` must be greater than 2.
- `b[2]` must not be equal to `a[1]`.

State: **`t`, `n`, `m` must be greater than 1, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `b[2]` must not be equal to `a[1]`**
