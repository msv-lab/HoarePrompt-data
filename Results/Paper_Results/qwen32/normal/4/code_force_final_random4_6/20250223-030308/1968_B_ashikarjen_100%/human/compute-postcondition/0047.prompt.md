Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively. The next line contains the binary string `a` of length `n`. The variable `b` is now assigned the binary string of length `m` for the current test case. `k` is 0. `j` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
        j += 1
    if j < m:
        k += 1
        j += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. If `j` is less than `m`, then `k` is increased by 1 and `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `j` is set to `m` because there is no index `j` such that `b[j] == a[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1. If `j` was less than `m`, then `j` is updated to `m + 1` and `k` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains equal to `m`. If `j` is not less than `m`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. `i` is 1. If `j` was originally less than `m`, then `j` is now `m + 1` and `k` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains `m` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
