The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` is initially 2, so after the increment, `j` becomes 3. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The condition `b[2] is not equal to a[i]` is also still valid as it does not involve `j`.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `m` must be greater than 2, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 3, `b[2]` is not equal to `a[i]`**.
