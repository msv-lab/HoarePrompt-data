Postcondition: **t remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, m remains unchanged, a remains unchanged, i is incremented by 1, j is equal to m, and j is less than m.**

However, there seems to be an inconsistency in the if condition and the postcondition as `j` is set to `m` and then immediately checked if `j < m`. This condition will never be true. If we assume that the intention was to check `i < m` after incrementing `i`, the postcondition would be:

Postcondition: **t remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, m remains unchanged, a remains unchanged, i is incremented by 1, j is equal to m, and i is less than m.**
