The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'200'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, and `z`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'200'`.

Let's break down the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of `a` up to the first space.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of `a` starting right after the first space.
- `z` is incremented by 1, but its value is not used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is `print('200')`, it will output the string `'200'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, or `z`.

Output: **200**
