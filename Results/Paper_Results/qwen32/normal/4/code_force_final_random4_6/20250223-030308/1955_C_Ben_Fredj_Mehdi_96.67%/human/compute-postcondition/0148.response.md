The variable `g` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, `z`, and `d` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space; `z` is incremented by 1; `d` is `len(a) - 1`; `g` is 0.**
