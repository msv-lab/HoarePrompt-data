Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers where the first element `a[0]` is decremented by 1 (if `g` was 1, `a[0]` remains the same, if `g` was 0, `a[0]` becomes -1 and `g` becomes 1); the last element `a[d]` is decremented by 1, and if it was 0, `d` is `len(a) - 2`; otherwise, `d` remains `len(a) - 1`; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is an integer value of at least 2; `z` is incremented by 1; `i` is 1; if `a[g]` is 0, `g` is incremented by 1; additionally, if `a[d]` was 0, `d` is decremented by 1.**
