The code snippet provided is:

```python
a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
```

Given the initial state, the variable `a[d]` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the operation.

Here is the impact on the variables:
- `a[d]` is decremented by 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, `z`, `i`, `g`) remain unchanged unless `a[d]` was 0 and `d` was updated to `len(a) - 2`.

Let's break it down:
- If `a[d]` was greater than 0, it simply becomes `a[d] - 1`.
- If `a[d]` was 0, it becomes -1, and `d` is updated to `len(a) - 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers where the first element `a[0]` is decremented by 1 (if `g` was 1, `a[0]` remains the same, if `g` was 0, `a[0]` becomes -1 and `g` becomes 1); the last element `a[d]` is decremented by 1, and if it was 0, `d` is `len(a) - 2`; otherwise, `d` remains `len(a) - 1`; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is an integer value of at least 2; `z` is incremented by 1; `i` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the element at index `d` in the list `a` is decreased by 1. If it was 0, it is now -1, and `d` is adjusted to `len(a) - 2` if it was the last element. All other variables remain the same.
