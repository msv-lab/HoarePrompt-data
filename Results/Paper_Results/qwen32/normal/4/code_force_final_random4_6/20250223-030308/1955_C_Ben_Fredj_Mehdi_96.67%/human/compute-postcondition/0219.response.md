Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. **`a`**: A list of integers obtained from an input line split by spaces.
3. **`z`**: Incremented by 1 (though `z` is not used in the provided code snippet).
4. **`n`**: The integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
5. **`k`**: The integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'2'`. The values of `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, and `k` are not used in the provided code snippet, so they do not affect the output.

### Output:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'2'`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **2**
