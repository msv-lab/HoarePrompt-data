Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string.
3. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
4. `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.
5. `k` is not equal to 1999999998, 1999999999, 99999999999.
6. It is not the case that (n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1).
7. `k` is not equal to 9999999999, 100000000000, 10000000000000, 99999999999999, 199999999999999, 1000000000000, 200000000000.
8. It is not the case that (k == 2147483648 and n == 2).
9. It is not the case that (n == 2 and k == 1000000000 and a == [1000000000, 1000000000]).
10. `n` is 5 and `k` is 2147483648.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('2')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that directly outputs the string `'2'`.
- The variables `t`, `a`, `n`, and `k` are defined in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the value to be printed is solely dependent on the string provided in the `print` statement.

### Output:
Output: **2**
