Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. `a` is a list of integers.
3. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
4. `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.
5. `z` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet explicitly prints the string `'2'`. It does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, or `z`. Therefore, the value to be printed is directly provided in the code.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'2'`.

Output: **2**
