Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers where the first element `a[0]` is decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is an integer value of at least 2; `z` is incremented by 1; `d` is `len(a) - 1`; `g` is 0; `i` is 0**

In natural language: The value of the first element in the list `a` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
