Let's analyze the given task step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.
- `z` is incremented by 1.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('99999')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or objects defined in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'99999'`.

### Output:
The output of the `print` statement will be the string `'99999'`.

Output: **99999**
