The task involves understanding the initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- **`t`**: An input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- **`a`**: A list of integers obtained from an input line split by spaces.
- **`z`**: Incremented by 1 (though `z` is not used in the given print statement).
- **`n`**: The integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
- **`k`**: The integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('0')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet explicitly prints the string `'0'`. The values of the variables `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this particular `print` statement because it does not reference any of these variables.

### Output:
Output: **0**
