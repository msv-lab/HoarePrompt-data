To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes each test case. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a` according to specific conditions.

The loop includes several conditional statements that check the values of `k` and `n` and print specific values based on these conditions. If none of these conditions are met, it performs a series of operations to decrement elements in the list `a` and then prints the count of zeros in the list.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop processes each test case independently and the state after each iteration does not affect the subsequent iterations. Therefore, after all `t` iterations, the output state will be the cumulative result of processing each test case.

The output state after all iterations will be the concatenation of the outputs for each test case. Since the loop processes each test case independently and prints the result immediately, the final output state will be the sequence of outputs for each test case.

Here is the final output state in the required format:

Output State: **the sequence of outputs for each test case**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will be a sequence of results, one for each test case, printed in the order they were processed. Each result is determined by the conditions checked in the loop and the operations performed on the list `a` for that specific test case.
