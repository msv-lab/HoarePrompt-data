Postcondition: **`temp` is `i` if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1. `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. `n` is greater than 0. `m` is assigned the value read from the input. `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input list. `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input list in descending order. `i` is incremented by 1. If the condition in the if statement is met, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
