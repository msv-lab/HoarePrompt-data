Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `ans` includes the value `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `temp` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
