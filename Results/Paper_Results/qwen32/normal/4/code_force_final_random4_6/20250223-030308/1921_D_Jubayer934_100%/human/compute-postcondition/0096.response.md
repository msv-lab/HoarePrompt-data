To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `ans` list. The loop starts from the index `temp` and continues up to the index `n-1`, appending the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to the `ans` list.

Given the initial state and the behavior described, the loop will execute until `i` reaches `n-1` (assuming `n` is the length of list `a` and `b`). Therefore, the final state will be when `i` has taken all values from `temp` to `n-1`.

The final `ans` list will include:
1. The absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `temp`.
2. The absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`.

Let's summarize the final output state:

Output State: **`temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true, and `temp` is not `-1`. `n` must be greater than `temp`. `ans` is a list that includes the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `temp`, and the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, the final `ans` list will have:
- The absolute differences from the start of the lists up to the index `temp` (inclusive) using the formula `abs(a[i] - b[i])`.
- The absolute differences from the index `temp` to the end of the lists using the formula `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`.

This ensures that all elements from `temp` to `n-1` are included in the `ans` list with the correct absolute differences calculated according to the loop's logic.
