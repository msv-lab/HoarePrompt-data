Output State: **`temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true, and `temp` is not `-1`, `n` must be greater than `temp + 1`, `i` is `temp + 1`, `ans` is a list of the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to and including the index `temp`, and `ans` now includes `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)])` as its last element, and `ans` also includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` as its last element.**

In simpler terms, the list `ans` now has an additional element, which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`. All other conditions and values remain the same.
