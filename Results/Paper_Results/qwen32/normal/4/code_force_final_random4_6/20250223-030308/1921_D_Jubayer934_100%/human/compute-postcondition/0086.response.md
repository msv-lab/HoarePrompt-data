Postcondition: **`temp` is `i` if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1. `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all previous `i` values and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`. `n` is greater than 0; `m` is assigned the value read from the input; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input list; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input list in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`. If the condition in the if statement is true, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
