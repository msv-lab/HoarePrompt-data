The given code snippet appends the absolute difference `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to the list `ans`. 

Initial State: 
- `temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true, and `temp` is not `-1`.
- `n` must be greater than `temp + 1`.
- `i` is `temp + 2`.
- `ans` is a list of the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to and including the index `temp`, and `ans` now includes `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)])` as its last element, and `ans` also includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` as its last element.

The code appends `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to `ans`.

Output State: **`temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true, and `temp` is not `-1`; `n` must be greater than `temp + 1`; `i` is `temp + 2`; `ans` is a list of the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to and including the index `temp`, and `ans` includes `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)])`, `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, and now also includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` as its last element.**

In simpler terms, the list `ans` now has one additional element, which is `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
