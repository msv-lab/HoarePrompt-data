Postcondition: **`n` remains the first integer from the input. `m` remains the second integer from the input. `temp` is the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was first met, and `temp` is not equal to -1. `ans` contains the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks at the index `temp`. `a` remains the sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input. `b` remains the first `m` elements of the sorted list of the next `m` integers from the input in reverse order.**

In natural language: The final output state is that `temp` is the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` is greater than `abs(a[i] - b[i])` was first met, and `temp` is not -1. The list `ans` contains the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks at the index `temp`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
