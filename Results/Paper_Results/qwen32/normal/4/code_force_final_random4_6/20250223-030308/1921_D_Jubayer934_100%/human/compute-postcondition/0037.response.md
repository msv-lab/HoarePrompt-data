The code snippet provided affects the variable `a` by assigning it the first `n` integers from the input, sorted in ascending order. The variables `m`, `temp`, `ans`, and `b` remain unchanged. Since `a` is reassigned, its new value is the sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is the sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, `b` remains the first `m` elements of the sorted list of the next `m` integers from the input in reverse order.**
