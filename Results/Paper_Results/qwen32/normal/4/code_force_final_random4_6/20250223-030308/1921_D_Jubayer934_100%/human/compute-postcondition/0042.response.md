The `break` statement in the provided code will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is inside. This will not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `temp` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `temp` is `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
