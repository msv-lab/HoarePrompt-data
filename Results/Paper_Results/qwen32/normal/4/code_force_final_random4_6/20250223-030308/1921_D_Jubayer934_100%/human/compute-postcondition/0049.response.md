The code snippet `ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))` appends the absolute difference between the `i`-th elements of lists `a` and `b` to the list `ans`. 

Given the initial state, `ans` already includes `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, but this new line of code will add another element to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will now have one more element, which is `abs(a[i] - b[i])`.

The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `temp` remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement and the comparison involving `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `ans` includes `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `temp` retains its previous value.**
