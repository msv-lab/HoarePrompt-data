The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- `m` remains the second integer from the input.
- `temp` is an integer such that `0 <= temp < n`.
- `ans` contains the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks at the index `temp` and also includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`.
- `a` remains the sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input.
- `b` remains the first `m` elements of the sorted list of the next `m` integers from the input in reverse order.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `temp`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `temp` is an integer such that `0 <= temp < n`, `ans` contains the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks at the index `temp` and also includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, `a` remains the sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, `b` remains the first `m` elements of the sorted list of the next `m` integers from the input in reverse order, `i` is `temp + 1`**
