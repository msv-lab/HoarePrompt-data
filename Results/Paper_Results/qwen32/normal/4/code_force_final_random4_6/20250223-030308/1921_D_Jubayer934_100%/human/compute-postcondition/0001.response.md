The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `m` respectively. Given that the first input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer (number of test cases, at least 1), this precondition is still valid and does not change. The only variables affected by the code are `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input; the first input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer (number of test cases, at least 1).**
