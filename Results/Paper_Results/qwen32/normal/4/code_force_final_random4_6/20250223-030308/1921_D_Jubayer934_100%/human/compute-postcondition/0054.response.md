Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `ans` includes `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, and `abs(a[i+1] - b[i+1])`. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is set to `i + 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `temp` retains its previous value. `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` is still greater than `i + 2`, `a` and `b` remain as lists of integers. The list `ans` now includes the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, and `abs(a[i+1] - b[i+1])`. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The condition for `temp` remains the same and has not yet been evaluated with the new `i` value.
