The code snippet appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is `temp + 1`, so the value being appended is `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])`.

The initial state remains valid except for the changes to `ans`. The value of `temp`, `n`, and `i` are unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` is an index where `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)]) > abs(a[temp] - b[temp])` is met, and `temp` is not equal to -1, `n` must be greater than `temp`, `i` is `temp + 1`, and `ans` includes `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])`.**
