Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100. c is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 for each i from 1 to n.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())`, which means it now holds an integer input by the user, still within the range of 1 to 500. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `c`) are not affected and retain their initial conditions.
