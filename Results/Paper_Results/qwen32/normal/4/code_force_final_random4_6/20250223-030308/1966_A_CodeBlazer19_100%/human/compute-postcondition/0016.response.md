Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input; `p` is a list where each element is the count of a unique integer from `l`, specifically `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]`; `i` is incremented by 1. Regardless of whether `max(p) >= k` is true or false, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `p`, and `i` remain as described, with `i` incremented by 1.**
