The code snippet `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]` updates the list `p` to contain the counts of each unique integer in the list `l`. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is not affected by this code snippet as it is not used or modified.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` and `k` are new integers read from the input; `l` is a new list of integers read from the input; `p` is a list where each element is the count of a unique integer from the previous `l`, specifically `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
