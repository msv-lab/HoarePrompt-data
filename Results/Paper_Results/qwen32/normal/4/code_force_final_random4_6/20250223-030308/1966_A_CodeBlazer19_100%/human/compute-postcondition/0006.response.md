The given task involves an initial state description and a Python code snippet that contains a `print` statement. The initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement only involves the variable `k`.

Here's the breakdown of the given information:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `p` is a list where each element is the count of a unique integer from `l`. 
- The maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(k - 1)
```

This statement will output the value of `k - 1`. Since the exact value of `k` is not provided in the initial state, the output will be described in terms of `k`.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is an integer read from the input)**
