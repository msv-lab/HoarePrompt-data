Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of cards left is flawed. 

The program checks if the maximum count of any card number is greater than or equal to `k`. If so, it prints `k - 1`, which is not always correct. For instance, if there are multiple card numbers with counts greater than or equal to `k`, or if the counts can be combined in a way that reduces the total number of cards further, the program does not account for these scenarios.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of cards that can be reduced through the operations. For each unique card number, we can reduce the count of cards to `count % k` (the remainder when the count is divided by `k`). The sum of these remainders will give us the minimum number of cards left.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        remaining_cards = sum(count % k for count in p)
        if remaining_cards == 0:
            remaining_cards = k - 1
        print(remaining_cards)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum number of cards left by summing up the remainders of the counts of each unique card when divided by `k`. If the sum of these remainders is zero, it means all cards could be reduced to groups of `k` and one card would be left over from the last operation, hence `k - 1`.
