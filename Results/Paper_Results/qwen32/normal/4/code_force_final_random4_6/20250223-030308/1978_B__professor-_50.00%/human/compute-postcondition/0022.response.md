To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the expression step-by-step based on the provided initial state.

The print statement is:
```python
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
- `_` is 1.

However, the variable `_` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this analysis.

The expression inside the `print` statement is:
\[ \text{int}\left(\frac{(2 \cdot b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2}\right) \]

To understand the output, let's break down the expression:
1. Compute \(2 \cdot b\).
2. Subtract \(n\) from the result.
3. Add 1 to the result.
4. Multiply the result by \(n\).
5. Divide the result by 2.
6. Convert the result to an integer using `int()`.

The final output will be the integer value of the expression \(\frac{(2 \cdot b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2}\).

Since the exact values of `n` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of `n` and `b`.

Output: **The integer value of \(\frac{(2 \cdot b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2}\)**
