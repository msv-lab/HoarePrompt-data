To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the expression step by step based on the initial state provided.

Given:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then no change is made to `a` or `b`.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is either at least `n` or less than `n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
```

Let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

1. **Difference Calculation**:
   - `(b - a)`: This is the difference between `b` and `a`.
   
2. **Conditional Difference Handling**:
   - If `b <= a`, then `(b - a)` will be 0 or negative, and the subsequent calculations will reflect this.
   - If `b > a`, then `(b - a)` will be positive.

3. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `(b - a) / 2`: This is half of the difference between `b` and `a`. Since we are using integer division (`int()`), the result will be an integer.
   - `(b - a + 1)`: This is the difference between `b` and `a` plus one.
   - `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)`: This is the product of the two terms above. It calculates a part of the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `a` to `b`.
   - `a * n`: This is the product of `a` and `n`.
   - `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`: This is the final expression that combines the above calculations.

Given these steps, the output of the print statement will depend on the values of `a`, `b`, and `n`. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions:

- If `b <= a`, then `(b - a)` is 0 or negative, making the first part of the expression 0. The output will be `a * n`.
- If `b > a`, then the expression calculates the sum of an arithmetic series from `a` to `b` and adds `a * n`.

Let's formalize this:

- If `b <= a`:
  - Output: **a * n**
- If `b > a`:
  - Output: **int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)**

Since we don't have specific values for `a`, `b`, and `n`, we can't compute an exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n) (where the expression is calculated based on the values of a, b, and n)**
