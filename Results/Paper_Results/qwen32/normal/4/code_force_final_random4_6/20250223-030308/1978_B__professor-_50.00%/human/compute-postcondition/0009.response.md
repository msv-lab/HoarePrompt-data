To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down and analyze the expression inside the `print` function step by step.

The expression is:
```python
int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)
```

Let's define the components of this expression based on the initial state:

1. **`b - a`**: This is the difference between `b` and `a`. According to the precondition, `b` is greater than `a`, and the difference `b - a` is less than `n`.

2. **`(b - a) / 2`**: This is half of the difference between `b` and `a`. Since `b` and `a` are integers, this division will result in a float. However, the entire expression is cast to an integer using `int()`, so the fractional part will be truncated.

3. **`(b - a + 1)`**: This is one more than the difference between `b` and `a`.

4. **`(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)`**: This part of the expression calculates half of the product of `b - a` and `b - a + 1`. This is essentially the sum of the first `b - a` positive integers, which can be derived from the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

5. **`a * n`**: This is the product of `a` and `n`.

6. **`int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`**: The entire expression is cast to an integer, which means the final result will be an integer.

Let's put this all together:

- The term `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)` calculates the sum of the first `b - a` integers, starting from 1, and then multiplies this sum by `(b - a) / 2`.
- This sum is then added to `a * n`.

The final result of this expression is an integer value, which is the sum of the arithmetic series adjusted by the product of `a` and `n`.

Given the initial state, we can't compute the exact numerical value without specific values for `a`, `b`, and `n`. However, we can describe the output precisely in terms of the given variables.

Output: **int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n) (where b is greater than a, and the difference b - a is less than n)**
