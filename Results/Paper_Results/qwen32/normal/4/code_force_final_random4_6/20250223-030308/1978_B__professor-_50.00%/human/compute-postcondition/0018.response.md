Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 2; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input. No change is made to `a` or `b` regardless of whether `b` is less than or equal to `a` or greater than `a`. The difference between `b` and `a` remains either at least `n` or less than `n` if `b` is greater than `a`.**
