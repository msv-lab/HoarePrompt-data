Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the input integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, integers `n`, `a`, and `b` are read from the input. The output for each test case is determined based on the conditions: if `b <= a`, the output is `n * a`; if `b - a >= n`, the output is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `2 * b - n + 1` with a common difference of `-1`; otherwise, the output is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `a` with a common difference of `1`, plus `a * n`.**

In simpler terms: The loop has processed all `t` test cases, and for each case, it has calculated and printed a value based on the relationship between `a` and `b` relative to `n`.
