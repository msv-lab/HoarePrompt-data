Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then no change is made to `a` or `b`. If `b` is greater than `a`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is either at least `n` or less than `n`.**
