Postcondition: **`kq1` and `kq2` are set based on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `vt` was initially 0, then if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`. If `vt` was not 0, then `kq1` is the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`. `vt` is 1 if it was initially 0, and remains unchanged otherwise. `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is `q + 1`, `a` is a sequence with at least one element, `b` is the user input, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.**
