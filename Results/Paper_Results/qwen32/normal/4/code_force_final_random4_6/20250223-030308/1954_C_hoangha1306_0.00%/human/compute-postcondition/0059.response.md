To determine what will be printed by the `print(kq1)` statement, we need to understand the context and the initial state provided. Let's break down the information given:

- `kq1` and `kq2` are strings that are built based on the comparison of `a` and `b`.
- `vt` is a variable that is set to 1 if there was at least one mismatch between `a` and `b`, otherwise it is set to 0.
- `x` and `y` are the minimum and maximum of the last compared characters.
- `t` remains unchanged.

The exact values of `kq1` and `kq2` are not explicitly provided, but we know they are constructed based on the comparison of `a` and `b`. Therefore, to determine the output, we need to understand how `kq1` is constructed based on the comparison.

Since the exact construction rules for `kq1` are not specified, we can only describe it in terms of the comparison of `a` and `b`. Typically, `kq1` might contain a string representation of the comparison results, such as indicating positions where `a` and `b` differ, or it might be a summary of the comparison.

Given the information:
- `kq1` is a string built based on the comparison of `a` and `b`.
- `vt` and `x`, `y` are not directly related to the output of `print(kq1)`.

Thus, the output will be the string `kq1`, which encapsulates the comparison result between `a` and `b`.

Output: **kq1 (where kq1 is a string built based on the comparison of a and b)**
