Output State: **`kq1` is the original value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `x`; `kq2` is the string representation of `y`; `vt` is 1; `a` is a sequence with at least one element; `b` is the user input; `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`; the current value of `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; the current value of `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `t` remains unchanged; `q` is `q + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `kq2` has been updated to be the string representation of `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
