The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to the current value of `kq1`. 

Initial State: `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `t` is greater than 0; `a` is the value of the user input and has a length greater than 0; `b` is the value of the user input; `i` is 2.

After executing the code, `kq1` will have its original value concatenated with the string representation of `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `t` is greater than 0; `a` is the value of the user input and has a length greater than 0; `b` is the value of the user input; `i` is 2; `kq1` is its original value concatenated with `str(y)`**.
