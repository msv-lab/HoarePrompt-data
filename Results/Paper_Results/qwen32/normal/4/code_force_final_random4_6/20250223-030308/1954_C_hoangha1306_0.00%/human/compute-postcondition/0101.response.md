Postcondition: **`a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `vt` was 0, then `vt` is set to 1, and if `a[i] > b[i]`, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `y`; otherwise, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`. If `vt` was not 0, then `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(y)` and `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(x)`.**
