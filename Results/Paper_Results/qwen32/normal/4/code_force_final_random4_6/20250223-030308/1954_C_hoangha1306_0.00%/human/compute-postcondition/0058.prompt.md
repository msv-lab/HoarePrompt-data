Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and they have the same length; `t` must be greater than 0; `a` is the value of the user input; `b` is the value of the user input; `kq1` is an empty string; `kq2` is an empty string; `vt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and they have the same length; `t` is greater than 0; `a` is the value of the user input and has a length greater than 0; `b` is the value of the user input; `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to that character. Otherwise, if `vt` was originally 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of the minimum of the `i`th element of `a` and `b` converted to an integer, `kq2` is set to the string representation of the maximum of the `i`th element of `a` and `b` converted to an integer, and `vt` is set to 1. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `x`. In both cases, `x` is the minimum of the `i`th element of `a` and `b` converted to integers, and `y` is the maximum of the `i`th element of `a` and `b` converted to integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and they have the same length; `t` is greater than 0; `a` is the value of the user input and has a length greater than 0; `b` is the value of the user input; `i` is 1. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are each increased by the integer value of `a[1]`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`; `y` is the maximum of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`; `vt` is set to 1 if it was initially 0, otherwise it remains unchanged; `kq1` is the string representation of `x` if `a[i] <= b[i]` and `vt` was initially 0, otherwise `kq1` is the string representation of `y`; `kq2` is the string representation of `y` concatenated with the string representation of `x` if `vt` was initially 0, otherwise `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and they have the same length; `t` is greater than 0; `a` and `b` are the values of user input and have lengths greater than 0; `i` is 2. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are each concatenated with `a[2]`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is concatenated with `str(y)` and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is concatenated with `str(x)` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise with `str(y)`, and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise with `str(y)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
