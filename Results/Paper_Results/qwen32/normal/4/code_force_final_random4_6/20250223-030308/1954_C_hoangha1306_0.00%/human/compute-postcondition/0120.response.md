To determine what will be printed by the `print(kq2)` statement, we need to understand the context and the value of `kq2` based on the given initial state.

The initial state provides information about several variables:
- `kq1` and `kq2` are constructed strings based on some rules (the specific rules are not provided, so we cannot determine their exact values).
- `vt` is a flag that is 1 if there was at least one differing character, otherwise 0.
- `x` and `y` are the last compared minimum and maximum values.
- `t` remains unchanged (its value is not specified).
- `q` is the length of the string `a` (the string `a` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `q`).

Since the specific rules for constructing `kq1` and `kq2` are not provided, we can only describe `kq2` in terms of how it is constructed based on the given information.

Given that `kq2` is constructed based on some rules, the output of the `print(kq2)` statement will be the value of `kq2` as it has been constructed according to those rules. Since the exact construction rules are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `kq2`.

Output: **kq2 (where kq2 is the constructed string based on the rules)**
