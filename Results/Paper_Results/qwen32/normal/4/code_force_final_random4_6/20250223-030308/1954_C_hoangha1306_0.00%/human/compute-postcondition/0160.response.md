Output State: **`kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with `str(y)`, `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with `str(x)`, `vt` remains unchanged, `x` remains the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` remains the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is `q + 1`, `a` remains a sequence with at least one element, `b` remains the user input, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms: `kq2` now includes the string representation of `x` appended to it. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
