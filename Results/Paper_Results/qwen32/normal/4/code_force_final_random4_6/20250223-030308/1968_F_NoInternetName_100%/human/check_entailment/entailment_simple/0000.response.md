### Reasoning:

The given Python program is intended to determine whether a subarray of a given array is "interesting" based on the criteria that the subarray can be split into more than one part where the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. The program uses a cumulative XOR approach and binary search to efficiently handle the queries.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Cumulative XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates a cumulative XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the `i-1`th element.
   - This allows for quick XOR calculations of any subarray `a[l...r]` by simply computing `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.

2. **Index Mapping with `inds`**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `inds` to map each unique XOR value to a list of indices where that value appears in the cumulative XOR array `x`.
   - This helps in quickly finding the relevant indices for binary search operations.

3. **Binary Search Functions**:
   - `func_2` and `func_3` are binary search functions that find the largest index in a given list that satisfies a certain predicate condition.
   - `func_4` seems to be intended to return a similar index but adds 1 to the result, which might be for 1-based indexing purposes but is incorrectly implemented as it tries to add 1 to a potentially `None` value, leading to a `TypeError`.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the cumulative XOR values at the start and end of the subarray are equal (`x[r] == x[l-1]`). If they are, the subarray is trivially interesting.
   - If not, it uses binary search to find the relevant indices in the `inds` dictionary and checks if there exists a valid split point within the subarray.
   - The logic for finding `lower` and `upper` indices seems correct but the implementation of `func_4` could lead to errors if `func_2` returns `None`.

5. **Correctness Issues**:
   - The main issue with the program is the incorrect implementation of `func_4`, which could lead to a `TypeError` if `func_2` returns `None`.
   - Additionally, the logic for handling queries seems correct but could be improved for clarity and robustness.

### Conclusion:
Despite the logic being mostly correct, the implementation has a critical flaw in `func_4` that could cause runtime errors. Therefore, the program is not fully correct as it stands.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
