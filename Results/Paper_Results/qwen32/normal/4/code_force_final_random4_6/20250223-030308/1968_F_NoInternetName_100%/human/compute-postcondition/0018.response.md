Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Variables and their Definitions:**
   - `n` and `q` are integers returned by `func_1`.
   - `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l < r \leq n\).
   - `x` is a list containing \(n+1\) elements where:
     - The first element is `0`.
     - Each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
   - `inds` is a `defaultdict` of lists where each key is a unique value in `x` and the value is a list of indices in `x` where that value appears.
   - `q` is greater than 0.
   - `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Yes')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.
   - The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `x`, and `inds` do not affect the output of this specific print statement.
   - The condition `x[l - 1] == x[r]` is a detail about the structure of `x` but does not influence the print statement.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **Yes**
