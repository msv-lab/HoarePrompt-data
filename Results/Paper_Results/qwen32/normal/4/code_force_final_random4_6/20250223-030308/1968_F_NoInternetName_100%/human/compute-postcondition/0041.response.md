The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Given the code snippet and initial state, the values of `i`, `l`, and `r` are not directly affected by the `continue` statement itself. The value of `i` is described as `i + 1`, which suggests it might be part of an increment operation within a loop, but the `continue` statement does not alter this. Similarly, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, and they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`; the loop continues to the next iteration.**
