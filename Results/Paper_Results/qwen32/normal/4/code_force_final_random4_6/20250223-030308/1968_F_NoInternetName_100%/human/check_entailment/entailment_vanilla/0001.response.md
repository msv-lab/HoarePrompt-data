To determine if the provided Python program is correct, let's analyze the logic and implementation step by step.

### Problem Analysis
We need to determine if a given subarray can be split into more than one part such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same. The main idea is to use prefix XOR values to check if such a division is possible.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, the array `a`, and the queries.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR for the array `a` and stores it in the list `x`.
   - It also maintains a dictionary `inds` that maps each prefix XOR value to the indices where this prefix XOR value occurs.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the subarray `a[l-1:r]` can be split into parts with equal XOR.
   - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it means the entire subarray has a XOR of 0, which implies it can be split into any number of parts with XOR 0. Hence, the answer is "Yes".
   - If `x[l-1] != x[r]`, it uses the indices stored in `inds` to find if there exists an index `lower` such that `inds[x[r]]` has an index less than `l` and an index `upper` such that `inds[x[l-1]]` has an index less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper > lower`, it means there exists a point in the subarray where the prefix XOR can be split into two parts with the same XOR, hence the answer is "Yes". Otherwise, the answer is "No".

### Functions Explanation
- **func_1:** Reads a line of input and converts it to a list of integers.
- **func_2:** Binary search to find the largest index in `arr` where the `predicate` is true.
- **func_3:** Calls `func_2` to find the largest index in `arr` where the `predicate` is true.
- **func_4:** Calls `func_2` and adjusts the result by adding 1. It returns `None` if no such index is found.
- **func_5:** Main function that processes each test case, reads the array, computes the prefix XOR, and processes each query.

### Correctness Verification
- The program correctly computes the prefix XOR values.
- The use of binary search in `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` ensures that the indices are found efficiently.
- The logic for checking the subarray's XOR properties is correct.
- The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion
The provided program seems to implement the solution correctly based on the analysis. It efficiently handles the queries and checks the conditions for the subarray to be interesting.

Correctness: **True**
