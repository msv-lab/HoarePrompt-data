Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `x` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique value in `x` and the value is a list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `q` is greater than 0, `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` that satisfies the condition `arg <= r` as processed by `func_3`, `i` is `i + 1`, `lower` is `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`**

Explanation: The variable `upper` is updated to be the index from the list `inds[x[l - 1]]` that satisfies the condition `arg <= r` as determined by the function `func_3`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
