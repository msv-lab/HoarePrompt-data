You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly implements the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if a subarray can be split into `k > 1` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same.
- For each query, we are given a subarray defined by indices `l` and `r`.
- The output should be "YES" if the subarray is interesting, otherwise "NO".

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a prefix XOR array (`x`) and a dictionary (`inds`) to map XOR values to their indices. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - `x` is initialized with a 0.
   - For each element in the array `a`, the cumulative XOR is calculated and stored in `x`.
   - `inds` keeps track of the indices where each XOR value occurs.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, it checks if the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1:r]` is zero (`x[r] == x[l-1]`). If true, it prints "YES".
   - If not, it searches for indices in `inds` that fall within the range `[l, r]` and checks if there is a valid split.

### Correctness Verification:
Let's check the logic against the problem description:

- **Zero XOR Case**:
  - If `x[r] == x[l-1]`, it means the XOR of the entire subarray is zero, which implies it can be split into two parts with equal XOR (both being zero).
  - This is correctly handled by the program.

- **Non-Zero XOR Case**:
  - The program searches for indices in `inds[x[r]]` and `inds[x[l-1]]` to find a valid split.
  - It ensures that the found indices fall within the range `[l, r]` and checks if there is a valid split.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Subarray**:
  - The problem description specifies `1 <= l < r`, so a single element subarray is not possible.
- **All Elements Same**:
  - If all elements in the subarray are the same, the XOR will be zero, and the program will correctly output "YES".
- **Alternating Elements**:
  - For example, `[1, 2, 1, 2]` can be split into `[1, 2]` and `[1, 2]` with equal XOR.
  - The program should handle this correctly.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with a few additional cases to ensure correctness:

#### Test Case 1:
```
1
4 1
1 2 1 2
1 4
```
**Expected Output**: `YES` (since `1^2^1^2 == 0`)

#### Test Case 2:
```
1
5 1
1 2 3 4 5
1 5
```
**Expected Output**: `NO` (since `1^2^3^4^5 != 0` and no valid split exists)

#### Test Case 3:
```
1
6 1
1 1 1 1 1 1
1 6
```
**Expected Output**: `YES` (since `1^1^1^1^1^1 == 0`)

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and testing it with various cases, it appears to correctly determine if a subarray is interesting according to the problem description.

**Correctness: True**.

The program handles zero XOR cases and non-zero XOR cases by searching for valid splits using the prefix XOR array and index mapping. No edge cases seem to be missed based on the analysis and testing.
