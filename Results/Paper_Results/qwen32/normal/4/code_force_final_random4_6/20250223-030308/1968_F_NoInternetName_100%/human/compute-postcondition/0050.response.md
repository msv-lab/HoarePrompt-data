Functionality: **The function `func_5` processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` and a series of `q` queries, each defined by a pair of integers `l` and `r`. For each query, it determines whether there exists a subarray `a[l-1:r]` whose XOR is zero and prints "Yes" if such a subarray exists, otherwise it prints "No".**
