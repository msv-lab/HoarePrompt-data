To determine the Output State, we need to analyze the given code snippet and understand how it modifies the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` and `q` are integers.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`.
- `x` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
- `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique value in `x` and the value is a list of indices in `x` where that value appears.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `lower` is an integer determined by the indices in `inds[x[r]]` and the condition `arg < l`.

The code snippet does not modify `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `x`, or `inds`. It only calculates and assigns a value to `upper`.

The value of `upper` is determined by:
1. `inds[x[l - 1]]`: This gives a list of indices in `x` where the value `x[l - 1]` appears.
2. `func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)`: This function call filters the list of indices to find the index that satisfies the condition `arg <= r` and returns some specific index (the exact behavior of `func_3` is not specified, but it seems to return an index from the filtered list).

Thus, `upper` is assigned the value of the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` that satisfies the condition `arg <= r` as processed by `func_3`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique value in `x` and the value is a list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `q` is greater than 0, `lower` is an integer determined by the indices in `inds[x[r]]` and the condition `arg < l`, `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` that satisfies the condition `arg <= r` as processed by `func_3`.**
