The code appends the index of the last element of the list `x` to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. Initially, `x` is `[0, i, 0]`, so `x[-1]` is `0`. The index of the last element of `x` is `2`. Therefore, `inds[0]` will have `2` appended to it.

Initial State:
- `n` and `q` are new integers returned by `func_1`
- `a` is a new list of integers returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least two elements
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`
- `x` is a list containing elements `[0, i, 0]`
- `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 1]`
- `i` is the next element in the list `a`

After executing the code:
- `inds[0]` is now `[0, 1, 2]` because `2` is appended to the existing list `[0, 1]`

Output State: **`n` and `q` are new integers returned by `func_1`; `a` is a new list of integers returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least two elements; `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`; `x` is a list containing elements `[0, i, 0]`; `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2]`; `i` is the next element in the list `a`.**
