Postcondition: **`n` and `q` are integers returned by `func_1`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique value in `x` and the value is a list of indices in `x` where that value appears, and `q` is greater than 0. Additionally, `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`**
