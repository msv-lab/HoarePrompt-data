The function `read` is expected to handle input parsing where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with two integers `n` and `q` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of elements in the array and the number of queries respectively. The next line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i < 2^30) representing the elements of the array. Each of the next `q` lines contains two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the queries. It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5 and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
