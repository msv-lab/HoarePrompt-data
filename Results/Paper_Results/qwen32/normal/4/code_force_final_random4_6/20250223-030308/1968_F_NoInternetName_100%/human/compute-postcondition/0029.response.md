The code snippet provided assigns new values to `l` and `r` using the function `func_1(int)`. Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we can only infer that `l` and `r` will be updated to the values returned by `func_1` when called with an integer argument. 

Given the initial state, all other variables remain unchanged. The new values of `l` and `r` are the only changes to the state.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `x` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique value in `x` and the value is a list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `q` is greater than 0, `lower` is an integer determined by the indices in `inds[x[r]]` and the condition `arg < l`, `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` that satisfies the condition `arg <= r` as processed by `func_3`. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, then `upper` is greater than `lower`. Otherwise, `upper` is not greater than `lower`, `i` is `i + 1`**
