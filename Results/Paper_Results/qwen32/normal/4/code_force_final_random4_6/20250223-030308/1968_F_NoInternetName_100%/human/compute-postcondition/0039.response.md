The code snippet assigns the values returned by `func_1(int)` to the variables `l` and `r`. The value of `i` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is that `i` remains as `i + 1`, and `l` and `r` take on the values returned by `func_1(int)`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`**.
