The code snippet `a[i] = int(data[index])` updates the value at index `i` of the list `a` to be the integer value of `data[index]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 2.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `q` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[index])`.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.
- `index` is `index + 5`.
- `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element is 0 except `pf[1]` which is `int(data[index])`.
- `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` contains the value `[0]` and `mp[pf[1]]` contains the value `[1]`.
- `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'.
- `i` is 2.

The value of `a[2]` is updated to `int(data[index])`. Therefore, the new state of `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[index])` and `a[2]` which is also `int(data[index])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 2; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[1]` and `a[2]` which are both `int(data[index])`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `index + 5`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element is 0 except `pf[1]` which is `int(data[index])`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` contains the value `[0]` and `mp[pf[1]]` contains the value `[1]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'; `i` is 2.**
