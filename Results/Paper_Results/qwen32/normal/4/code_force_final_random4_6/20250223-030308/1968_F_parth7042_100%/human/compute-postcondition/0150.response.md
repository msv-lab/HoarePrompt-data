Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*q]`; `q` is an integer value of `data[index - 2*q - 1]` and must be 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the integer values of `data[index - 2*q - 2]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `index + 2*q`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[i]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'.**

In natural language, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will have been decremented by 1 from its initial value. The variable `n` will hold the integer value from the position `index - 2*q` in the `data` list, and `q` will be 0, indicating that all queries have been processed. The list `a` will contain `n + 1` elements, with the first element being 0 and the subsequent elements being the integer values from the `data` list starting at position `index - 2*q - 2`. The `index` will have been incremented by `2*q` to account for all the processed queries. The list `pf` will store the cumulative XOR values up to each index, and `mp` will map each cumulative XOR value to the list of indices where it occurs. Finally, the `results` list will contain the answers ('YES' or 'NO') for each of the `q` queries that were processed.
