Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 3; `results` is an empty list; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` contains the value `[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` is `int(data[3])` and all other elements are 0; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 4; `results` is an empty list; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` for the specific `i`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices where `pf` has the value `pf[i]`, including the newly appended `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is 0, `a[2]` is `int(data[4])`, and all other elements are 0; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 5; `results` is an empty list; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[0]` is 0, `pf[1]` is 0, `pf[2]` is `int(data[4])`, and all other elements are 0; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 1]`, `mp[int(data[4])]` contains the list `[2, 2]`; `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is 0, `a[2]` is `int(data[4])`, `a[3]` is `int(data[5])`, and all other elements are 0; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 6; `results` is an empty list; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[0]` is 0, `pf[1]` is 0, `pf[2]` is `int(data[4])`, `pf[3]` is `int(data[4]) ^ int(data[5])`, and all other elements are 0; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 1]`, `mp[int(data[4])]` contains the list `[2, 2]`, `mp[int(data[4]) ^ int(data[5])]` contains the list `[3]`; `i` is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
