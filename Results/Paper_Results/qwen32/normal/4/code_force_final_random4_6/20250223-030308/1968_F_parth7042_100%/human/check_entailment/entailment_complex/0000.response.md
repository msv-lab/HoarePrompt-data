### Reasoning:

The provided program `func_1` is designed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of an array and a series of queries. The goal is to determine if a specified subarray can be divided into two or more parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The input is read as a single string and split into a list of strings (`data`).
   - The number of test cases (`t`) is extracted from the first element of `data`.
   - For each test case, the values of `n` (number of elements in the array) and `q` (number of queries) are extracted.
   - The array `a` is constructed from the next `n` elements.
   - A prefix XOR array `pf` is computed where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - A dictionary `mp` is used to store the indices where each prefix XOR value appears.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the subarray from index `l` to `r` is considered.
   - The XOR of the subarray `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` is computed as `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
   - If `x` is `0`, the subarray can be trivially divided into any number of parts with XOR `0`, so the answer is 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, the program checks if there exists an index in `mp[pf[r]]` that is greater than or equal to `l` and an index in `mp[pf[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`, and the first index is less than the second. This indicates that there is a valid way to split the subarray into parts with equal XOR.

3. **Output:**
   - The results of all queries are collected in a list and printed as a single string with each result on a new line.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The program correctly computes the prefix XOR values and uses them to determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR.
  - The use of binary search (`bisect_left`) ensures that the program efficiently checks for the existence of valid split points.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the XOR of the entire subarray is `0`, which trivially satisfies the condition.
  - The program ensures that the indices are correctly managed to avoid out-of-bounds errors.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program processes each test case in linear time relative to the number of elements and queries, which is efficient given the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be correctly implemented and handles the problem as described. The logic is sound, and the implementation is efficient.

**Correctness: True**
