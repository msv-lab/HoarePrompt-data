Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is initialized to 0.
- `n` and `q` are integers from the last test case processed.
- `a` is a list of integers from the last test case processed.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.
- `index` is the position in `data` after processing all test cases.
- `results` is a list containing the result of each of the queries from all test cases, either 'YES' or 'NO'.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement is using the `join` method to concatenate all the elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). Each element in the `results` list is either 'YES' or 'NO'.

### Output:
Based on the initial state, the `results` list contains the results of the queries from all test cases. Since the exact contents of `results` are not explicitly given, we can describe the output in terms of the contents of `results`.

Output: **'YES\nNO\nYES\n...' (where each line is either 'YES' or 'NO' corresponding to the results of the queries from all test cases)**

This output represents a series of lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on the results of the queries processed in the test cases. The exact sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' cannot be determined without the specific contents of `results`, but the format is clear.
