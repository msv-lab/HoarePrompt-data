### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated version to verify the correctness of the solution provided.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if a subarray can be split into two or more parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same.
   - We need to handle multiple test cases and multiple queries for each test case.

2. **Key Concepts in the Program:**
   - **Prefix XOR (`pf`)**: The program calculates the prefix XOR for the array. `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the `i`-th element.
   - **Mapping Prefix XOR Values (`mp`)**: The program maps each prefix XOR value to the indices where it occurs using a dictionary.
   - **Query Handling**: For each query `(l, r)`, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the prefix XOR values: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`. If `x == 0`, the subarray can be trivially split into two parts with the same XOR (since the entire subarray has an XOR of 0). Otherwise, the program checks if there exists an index `i` in the subarray where the prefix XOR up to `i` (exclusive) equals `pf[l-1]` and the prefix XOR up to `r` (inclusive) equals `pf[r]`. This would imply that the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `i` is equal to the XOR of the subarray from `i+1` to `r`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and processes it in a loop for each test case.
   - **Prefix XOR Calculation**: For each element in the array, the program calculates the prefix XOR and stores it in the `pf` array.
   - **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**: The program uses a dictionary `mp` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
   - **Processing Queries**: For each query `(l, r)`, the program calculates `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`. If `x == 0`, the answer is "YES". Otherwise, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find if there exists an index `i` in the subarray `[l, r]` such that `pf[i] == pf[l-1]` and `pf[r]` is present after `i`. If such an `i` exists, the answer is "YES"; otherwise, it is "NO".

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly computes the prefix XOR values and maps them to their respective indices.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the XOR of the entire subarray is zero, indicating that the subarray can be trivially split.
   - The program uses binary search to efficiently find the required indices for each query, ensuring that the solution is efficient even for large inputs.

5. **Annotations:**
   - The annotated version confirms that the program processes the input correctly and maintains the correct state throughout the execution.
   - The annotations also confirm that the program correctly handles the prefix XOR calculations and the binary search for each query.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray can be split into two or more parts with the same XOR value. It efficiently handles the prefix XOR calculation and uses a dictionary and binary search to quickly find the required indices for each query.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
