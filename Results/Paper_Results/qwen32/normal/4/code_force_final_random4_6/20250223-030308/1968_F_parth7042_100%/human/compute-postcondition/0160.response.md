The code snippet `a[i] = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the `i`th element of the list `a`. Given that `i` is 1, `a[1]` will be updated with the integer value of `data[index]`.

Here is the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 2.
- `n` remains at least 1.
- `q` remains the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `a` is now a list of `n + 1` zeros except for `a[1]` which is updated to `int(data[index])`.
- `data` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.
- `index` remains `index + 4`.
- `pf` remains a list of `n + 1` elements where each element is 0.
- `mp` remains a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` contains the value `[0]`.
- `results` remains a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'.
- `i` remains 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 2; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[index])`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `index + 4`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element is 0; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` contains the value `[0]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'; `i` is 1.**
