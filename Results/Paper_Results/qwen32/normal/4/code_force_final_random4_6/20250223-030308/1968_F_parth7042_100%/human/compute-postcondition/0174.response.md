Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 2; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` for i in range 1 to n are all `int(data[index])`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `index + 3 + n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element is 0 except `pf[i]` for i in range 1 to n are calculated as `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` contains the value `[0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` is the same; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'; `i` is n.`**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all iterations, the variable `t` remains the initial value of `data[0]` decremented by 2. The variable `n` indicates the number of iterations the loop ran, and `q` retains its initial value. The list `a` will have `n` elements starting from index 1, each set to the integer value of `data[index]`. The variable `index` will be incremented by `3 + n` to reflect all the data points processed. The list `pf` will have `n` elements starting from index 1, each calculated as the XOR of the previous `pf` value and the corresponding `a` value. The dictionary `mp` will map each unique `pf` value to the list of indices where that `pf` value occurs. The variable `results` will still contain the results of the `q` queries, and `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations.
