The code snippet provided is `results.append('NO')`. This means that the string `'NO'` is being added to the end of the list `results`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `results`, as we are appending to it. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 2; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index]` decremented by 2 and must be greater than or equal to 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` for i in range 1 to n are all `int(data[index])`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `index + 9 + n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element is 0 except `pf[i]` for i in range 1 to n are calculated as `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` contains the value `[0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` is the same; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO', and the last element of `results` is 'NO'; `i` is `n`; `l` is `int(data[index])`; `r` is `int(data[index + 1])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is the list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals `pf[r]`; `v2` is the list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals `pf[l - 1]`; `it1` is the position where `l` would fit in `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**
