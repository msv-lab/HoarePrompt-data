Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30; for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    q = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    a = [0] * (n + 1)
    pf = [0] * (n + 1)
    mp = defaultdict(list)
    mp[0].append(0)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i] = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
        mp[pf[i]].append(i)
    for _ in range(q):
        l = int(data[index])
        r = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
        if x == 0:
            results.append('YES')
            continue
        v1 = mp[pf[r]]
        v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
        it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
        it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
        if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` such that `q` is 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `int(data[3 + i - 1])` and all other elements are 0; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `3 + 2 * n + 1`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i` and all other elements are 0; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices where `pf` has the value `pf[i]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*q]`; `q` is an integer value of `data[index - 2*q - 1]` and must be 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the integer values of `data[index - 2*q - 2]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `index + 2*q`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[i]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 2; `n` is at least 1; `q` is 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` for i in range 1 to n are all `int(data[index])`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `initial_index + 2*q + n*q`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element is 0 except `pf[i]` for i in range 1 to n are calculated as `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` contains the value `[0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` is the same; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'; `i` is `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
