The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. 

The initial state provides information about the variables `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `n` is an even integer.

Since the `print` statement is independent of these variables, it will simply print 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
