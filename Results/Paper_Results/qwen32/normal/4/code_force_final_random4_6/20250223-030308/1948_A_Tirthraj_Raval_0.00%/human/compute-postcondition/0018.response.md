To determine the output of the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed by the code.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `n` is an even integer.
- `pattern` is a list with `n` elements alternating between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A'.

### Code Explanation:
The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(''.join(pattern))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Pattern Construction**: 
   - `pattern` is constructed to have `n` elements, alternating between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A'. 
   - For example, if `n` is 6, `pattern` will be `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B']`.
   
2. **Joining the Pattern**:
   - `''.join(pattern)` concatenates all elements of the list `pattern` into a single string without any separator.
   - Using the example above, `''.join(['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B'])` results in the string `"ABABAB"`.

### Output Description:
- The output will be a string consisting of `n` characters, alternating between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A'.
- The exact string depends on the value of `n`, but it will always follow the alternating pattern described.

### Final Output:
Output: **A string of `n` characters alternating between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A' (where `n` is an even integer)**
