### Reasoning:
The problem requires constructing a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string. A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

The provided program follows this logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in the described configuration.
4. If `n` is even, it constructs a string with `n` special characters by alternating 'A' and 'B'. For example, for `n=6`, the string "AAABAACC" is constructed, which has 6 special characters.

The construction of the string is done by iterating `n // 2` times and appending alternating 'A' and 'B' pairs to the `pattern` list. This ensures that every character in the resulting string is special because each 'A' is adjacent to 'B' and vice versa.

The provided program correctly handles the constraints and requirements as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
