Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 49; `n` is the input integer. If `n` is odd, then no additional changes are made to the variables. If `n` is even, then `pattern` is a list with `n` elements alternating between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A'. `pattern` is an empty list.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `pattern` has been initialized as an empty list. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. If `n` is even, `pattern` will later be populated with alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, but at this point, it is still an empty list. If `n` is odd, no further changes are made to the variables.
