Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Special Character Definition**: A character is considered "special" if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. For example, in the string "AAABAACC", the characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are special.
2. **Objective**: For a given integer `n`, construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters.
3. **Constraints**:
   - The length of the string can be at most 200.
   - Multiple solutions may exist, and any valid solution is acceptable.
   - If no such string can be constructed, output "NO".

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the integer `n`.
   - It checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where special characters come in pairs (one character equal to its left neighbor and different from its right neighbor, or vice versa).
   - If `n` is even, it constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters:
     - It creates a pattern using the characters 'A' and 'B'.
     - It repeats the pattern `n // 2` times, ensuring that each pair of characters contributes exactly 2 special characters to the total count.
     - It prints "YES" followed by the constructed string.

### Correctness Evaluation:
1. **Handling Odd `n`**: The program correctly identifies that it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters and outputs "NO" in such cases.
2. **Constructing the String for Even `n`**:
   - The pattern "ABABAB..." ensures that each pair of characters ('A' followed by 'B' or 'B' followed by 'A') contributes exactly 2 special characters.
   - For example, for `n = 6`, the pattern "ABABAB" results in 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
   - The length of the string is `n`, which is always even and thus within the 200-character limit.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both the cases where `n` is odd and where `n` is even, and it constructs a valid string when possible. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
