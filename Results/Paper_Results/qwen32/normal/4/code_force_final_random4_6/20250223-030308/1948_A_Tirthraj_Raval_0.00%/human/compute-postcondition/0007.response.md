The code snippet initializes an empty list named `pattern`. The initial state of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are input integers with specific constraints.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50; `n` is an input integer, and `n` is even; `pattern` is an empty list.**
