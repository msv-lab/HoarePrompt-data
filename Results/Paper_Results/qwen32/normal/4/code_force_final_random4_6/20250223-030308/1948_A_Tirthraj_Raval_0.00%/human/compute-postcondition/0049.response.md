The code appends an element to the `pattern` list. The element to be appended is determined by the expression `'AB'[i % 2]`. Given that `i` is 2, `i % 2` equals 0. Therefore, `'AB'[0]` is 'A', which will be appended to the `pattern` list.

The initial state of `pattern` is a list with four elements where the last element is 'A'. After appending 'A', the `pattern` list will have five elements, with the last two elements being 'A'.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be at least 5, `pattern` is a list with five elements where the last two elements are 'A', `i` is 2**.
