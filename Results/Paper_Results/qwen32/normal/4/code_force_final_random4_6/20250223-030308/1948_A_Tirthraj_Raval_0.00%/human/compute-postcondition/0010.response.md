The code appends to the `pattern` list based on the expression `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]`. Given that `i` is not defined in the initial state, we need to interpret the expression `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]` in terms of how it affects `pattern`. The expression `i % 2 ^ 1` simplifies to `i % 2` because the bitwise XOR operation `^ 1` inverts the least significant bit of `i % 2`. Therefore, `'AB'[i % 2]` will alternate between 'A' and 'B' depending on whether `i` is even or odd.

However, since `i` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact character that will be appended. We can only say that it will be either 'A' or 'B'.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an even integer and `n` is at least 2, `pattern` is a list with two additional elements, the last of which is either 'A' or 'B'.**
