The code snippet sets `k` to 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that `k` is now 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is the first integer read from input; `c` is the second integer read from input; `d` is the new input string; `e` is the new string read from input; `j` equals `b` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking early, otherwise `j` is the value at which the loop breaks; `k` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`.**
