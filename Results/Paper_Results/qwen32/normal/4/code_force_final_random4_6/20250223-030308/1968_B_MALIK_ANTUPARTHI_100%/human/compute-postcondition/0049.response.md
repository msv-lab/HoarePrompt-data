Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is at least 1, `c` is the second integer read from input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the new string read from input, `j` is the value at which the loop breaks, `k` is equal to `j`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain as specified in the initial state, except that the loop is broken out of at the value `j`, and `k` is set to `j`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The condition `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]` is still valid.
