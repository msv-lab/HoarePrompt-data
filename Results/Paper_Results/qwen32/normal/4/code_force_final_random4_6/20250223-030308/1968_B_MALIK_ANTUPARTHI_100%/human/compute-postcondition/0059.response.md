To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is only `j`. Given that `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop variable**: The loop variable in the loop head is `j`.
2. **Determine the current value of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `j + 1`. This means that the value of `j` at the start of the current iteration was `j`, and it got incremented to `j + 1` at the end.
3. **Adjust `j` for the next iteration**: For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented again. Therefore, `j` at the start of the next iteration will be `(j + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `j + 2`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, `k`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is at least 1, `c` is the second integer read from input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the new string read from input, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 2`.**
