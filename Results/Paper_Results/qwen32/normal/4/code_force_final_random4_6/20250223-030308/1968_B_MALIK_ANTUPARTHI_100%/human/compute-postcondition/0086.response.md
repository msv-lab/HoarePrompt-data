To determine the new output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and how it affects the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
```

This line of code performs the following operations:
1. `d[j]` retrieves the character at index `j` of the string `d`.
2. `e[k:]` slices the string `e` starting from index `k` to the end of the string.
3. `.index(d[j])` finds the index of the character `d[j]` within the sliced string `e[k:]`.
4. The result of the `.index()` method is then incremented by 1 and added to `k` to get the new value of `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5
- `a` is an integer greater than 0
- `b` is the first integer read from input and must be greater than 0
- `c` is the second integer read from input
- `d` is the new input string
- `e` is the new string read from input
- `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1
- `j` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 2

The only variable that changes in this code snippet is `k`. The new value of `k` is calculated as the position of the character `d[j]` in the substring `e[k:]` plus `k` plus 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is the first integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is the second integer read from input; `d` is the new input string; `e` is the new string read from input; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `j` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 2; `k` is the position of the character `d[j]` in the substring `e[k:]` plus `k` plus 1.**
