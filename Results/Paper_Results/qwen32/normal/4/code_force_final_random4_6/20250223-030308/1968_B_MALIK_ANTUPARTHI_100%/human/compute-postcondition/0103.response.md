To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's break down the behavior and state changes of the loop:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t`: Number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `n` and `m`: Integers representing some limits (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).
   - `a`: Number of iterations the loop will run.
   - `b`: Integer read from input for each iteration.
   - `c`: Integer read from input for each iteration.
   - `d`: String read from input for each iteration.
   - `e`: String read from input for each iteration.
   - `k`: Variable that gets updated based on the logic inside the loop.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - For each iteration `i` from 0 to `a-1`:
     - `b` and `c` are read from input.
     - `d` and `e` are read from input.
     - `k` is initialized to 0.
     - A nested loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = b-1`.
       - If `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, `k` is updated to the index of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus `k + 1`.
       - If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b-1`, `k` is set to `j + 1` and the loop breaks.
       - If `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to `j` and the loop breaks.
     - `k` is printed after each iteration.

3. **Output State after All Iterations**:
   - After all `a` iterations, the loop terminates.
   - Variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e` will remain in their last assigned state from the input.
   - `i` will be equal to `a` because it represents the number of completed iterations.
   - `k` will be the value determined by the last iteration's logic.

**Output State**: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer representing the number of iterations; `b` is the last integer read from input; `c` is the last integer read from input; `d` is the last input string; `e` is the last string read from input; `i` is equal to `a` (indicating all iterations are completed); `k` is the final value determined by the last iteration's logic, either set to `j + 1` when `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, or set to `j` when `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`.**

In simpler terms, the output state after all iterations is that the loop has completed all `a` iterations, and the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e` are in their last assigned states from the input. The variable `i` equals `a`, indicating that all iterations are completed, and `k` holds the final value determined by the logic of the last iteration.
