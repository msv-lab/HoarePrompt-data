The code snippet provided assigns new values to `b` and `c` by reading two integers from the input. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `d`, `e`, `j`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is the first integer read from input; `c` is the second integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` equals `b` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking early, otherwise `j` is the value at which the loop breaks; `k` is the final value determined by the loop's logic, either set to `j + 1` when `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, or set to `j` when `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`; `i` is `i + 1`**
