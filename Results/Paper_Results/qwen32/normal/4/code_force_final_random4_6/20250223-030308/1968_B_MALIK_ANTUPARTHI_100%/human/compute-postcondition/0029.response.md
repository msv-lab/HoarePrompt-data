Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `k` becomes `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.**
