Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer; `b` is a binary string of length `m`. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    b, c = map(int, input().split())
    d = input()
    e = input()
    k = 0
    for j in range(b):
        if d[j] in e[k:]:
            k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
            if k == c or j == b - 1:
                k = j + 1
                break
        else:
            k = j
            break
    print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` equals `b` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking early, otherwise `j` is the value at which the loop breaks; `k` is the final value determined by the loop's logic, either set to `j + 1` when `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, or set to `j` when `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is the first integer read from input; `c` is the second integer read from input; `d` is the new input string; `e` is the new string read from input; `j` equals `b` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `j` is the value at which the loop breaks; `k` is the value determined by the conditions inside the loop at the point of breaking or completion; `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is the iteration count at which the loop breaks, `k` is either `j + 1` or `j` based on the condition that caused the loop to break, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`) remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
