To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given Python code snippet and its impact on the variables.

The code snippet is:
```python
k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
```

Here's the step-by-step impact of the code on the variables:
- `k` is reassigned a new value based on the expression `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`.
- `e[k:]` extracts a substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of `e`.
- `d[j]` is the character at index `j` in the string `d`.
- `e[k:].index(d[j])` finds the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in the substring `e[k:]`.
- Adding `1` to this index accounts for the fact that Python's `index` method returns a 0-based index, but we want a 1-based index relative to the start of `e`.
- Finally, adding `k` adjusts this 1-based index within the substring to be a 1-based index relative to the entire string `e`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `k`, and it gets updated to the new calculated value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is at least 1, `c` is the second integer read from input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the new string read from input, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, `k` is the 1-based index of `d[j]` in `e` starting from index `k`.**
