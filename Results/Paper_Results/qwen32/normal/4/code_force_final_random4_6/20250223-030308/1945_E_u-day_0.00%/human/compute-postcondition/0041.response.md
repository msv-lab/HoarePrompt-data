Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`pos`**: This variable holds the index of the last occurrence of `k` in the list `arr`, or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`.
2. **`low` and `high`**: These are two consecutive indices such that `low + 1 == high`.
3. **`st`**: This is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during a loop. However, the specific values in this set are not relevant to the print statement.
4. **`arr[low]`**: This is explicitly stated to be not equal to `k`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```

#### Values to Print:
1. **`low + 1`**: Since `low` and `high` are consecutive indices such that `low + 1 == high`, `low + 1` is simply `high`.
2. **`pos + 1`**: This depends on the value of `pos`, which is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` will be the index of the last occurrence of `k`, and `pos + 1` will be the index right after the last occurrence of `k`.
- **Scenario 2**: If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` will be `-1`, and `pos + 1` will be `0`.

### Output Description:
Given the initial state, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `low` and `pos` because they depend on the specific contents of `arr` and the value of `k`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given information.

- `low + 1` will always be `high` because `low` and `high` are consecutive indices.
- `pos + 1` will be the index right after the last occurrence of `k` if `k` is found, or `0` if `k` is not found.

Output: **high, pos + 1 (where high is the index right after low, and pos + 1 is the index right after the last occurrence of k in arr, or 0 if k is not found in arr)**
