To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `n`. The variable `k`, `arr`, and `pos` are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop will execute `n` times, where `i` will take on values from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 automatically by the `range` function, so we do not need to adjust `i`.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The values of `k`, `arr`, and `pos` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `pos` is -1**
