The code adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(n - 1) // 2`, and it remains unchanged. The other variables (`pos`, `low`, `high`, `n`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is 0; `high` is `n - 1` where `n` must be greater than 2; `st` is a set containing the value `(n - 1) // 2`; `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`.**
