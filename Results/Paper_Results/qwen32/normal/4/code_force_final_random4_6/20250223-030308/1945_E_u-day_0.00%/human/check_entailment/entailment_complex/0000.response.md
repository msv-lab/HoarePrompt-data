### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem requirements to determine if the given program is correct.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` (length of the permutation) and `x` (the number to be found), followed by a permutation of size `n`.
   - Functions `func_1` and `func_2` are responsible for reading and processing the input. `func_1` reads a line of input and returns a map object of integers. `func_2` converts this map object into a list of integers.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The program searches for the position of `x` in the permutation array `arr` using a simple linear search. It stores the index of `x` in the variable `pos`.

3. **Binary Search Simulation:**
   - The program simulates a binary search to find the position where `x` would be located if the array were sorted.
   - The binary search is performed between indices `low` and `high` (initially set to `0` and `n-1`, respectively).
   - The program keeps track of the midpoints calculated during the binary search in a set `st`, although this set is not used further in the code.

4. **Output:**
   - If the value at `arr[low]` equals `x`, the program prints `0`, indicating no swaps are needed.
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. This suggests that the program intends to swap the element at `low` with the element at `pos` to make `arr[low]` equal to `x`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly implement the requirement to perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that after the binary search, `arr[low]` equals `x`.
- The program only handles the case where `arr[low]` equals `x` or where `x` is found in the array. However, it does not ensure that the array can be rearranged with at most 2 swaps to make `arr[low]` equal to `x` after the binary search.
- The set `st` is not utilized in a way that contributes to solving the problem, and the logic for determining the indices to swap is flawed.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly address the problem requirements. It fails to ensure that the array can be rearranged with at most 2 swaps to make `arr[low]` equal to `x` after the binary search.

**Correctness: False**
