The code snippet `st.add(mid)` adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. Initially, `st` contains the values `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid`. After adding `mid` to `st`, the set `st` will still contain `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid`, but now it will not contain any duplicates of `mid` if it was already present.

Given the initial conditions:
- `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
- If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `low` is 0 and `high` is equal to `mid` where `mid` is at least 2.
- Otherwise, `low` is now equal to `mid` and `high` is at least `low + 2`.
- `st` is a set containing the values `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid`.
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.

After executing `st.add(mid)`, the set `st` will definitely contain `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `low` is 0 and `high` is equal to `mid` where `mid` is at least 2; otherwise, `low` is now equal to `mid` and `high` is at least `low + 2`; `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**
