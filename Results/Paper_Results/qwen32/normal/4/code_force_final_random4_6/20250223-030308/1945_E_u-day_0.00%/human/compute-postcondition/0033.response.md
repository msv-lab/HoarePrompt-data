The code snippet assigns the value of `mid` to `high`. Therefore, `high` now holds the same value as `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `low` is 0 and `high` is equal to `mid` where `mid` is at least 2; otherwise, `low` is now equal to `mid` and `high` is at least `low + 2`; `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`; `high` is equal to `mid`.**
