To determine the final output state after the loop has completed all its iterations, we need to understand what the loop is doing. The loop iterates over the array `arr` and checks if each element is equal to `k`. If it finds an element equal to `k`, it updates the variable `pos` to the index of that element. If no such element is found, `pos` remains -1.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] == k:
        pos = i
```

After `n` iterations, the loop will have checked every element in `arr` from index `0` to `n-1`. The final value of `pos` will be the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.

**Output State: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.**

In natural language: After the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable `pos` will hold the index of the last element in the array `arr` that is equal to `k`. If `k` is not found in `arr` at all, `pos` will remain -1. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states as they are not modified within the loop.
