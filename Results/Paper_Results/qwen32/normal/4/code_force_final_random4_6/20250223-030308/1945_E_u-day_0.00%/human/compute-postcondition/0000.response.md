The code snippet `n, k = func_1()` indicates that the values of `n` and `k` will be reassigned to whatever values are returned by the function `func_1()`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, after the function call, these variables will take on the new values returned by `func_1()`. The output state will reflect these new values.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`.**
