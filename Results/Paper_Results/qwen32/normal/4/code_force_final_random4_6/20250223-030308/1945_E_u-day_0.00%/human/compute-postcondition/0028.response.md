The value of `low` is updated to be equal to `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is now equal to `mid`; `high` is at least `low + 2`; `st` is a set containing the values `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.
