Postcondition: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` and `high` are two consecutive indices such that `low + 1 == high`; `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop. Additionally, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.**
