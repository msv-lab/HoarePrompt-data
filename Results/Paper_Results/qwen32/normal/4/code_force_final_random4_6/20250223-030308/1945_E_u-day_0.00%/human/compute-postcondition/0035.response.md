Postcondition: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `low` is 0 and `high` is equal to `mid` where `mid` is at least 2. Otherwise, `low` is equal to `mid` and `high` is at least `low + 2`. `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid`. `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**
