Functionality: **The function determines the position of the value `k` in a permutation array `arr` of length `n`. It prints `0` if `k` is found at the position indicated by `low`, otherwise, it prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, where `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found.**
