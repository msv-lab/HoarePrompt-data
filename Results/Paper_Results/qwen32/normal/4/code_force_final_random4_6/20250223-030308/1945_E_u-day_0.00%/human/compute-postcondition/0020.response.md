The code snippet `high = mid` updates the value of `high` to be equal to `mid`. Given that `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`, the value of `high` is now also `(n - 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is 0; `high` is `(n - 1) // 2`; `st` is a set containing the value `(n - 1) // 2`; `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`. The value at `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`.**
