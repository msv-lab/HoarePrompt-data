The only variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `low + 1 < high`. At the end of the last iteration, we have:

- If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `low` is 0 and `high` is equal to `mid`.
- Otherwise, `low` is now equal to `mid` and `high` is at least `low + 2`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need `low + 1 < high` to be true. Let's consider the two cases:

1. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `low` is 0 and `high` is `mid`. For the loop to continue, `mid` must be at least 2 (since `0 + 1 < mid` requires `mid > 1`).

2. If `arr[mid]` is not greater than `k`, `low` is `mid` and `high` is at least `low + 2`. In this case, the condition `low + 1 < high` is already satisfied because `high` is at least `low + 2`.

Since we need to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we should adjust the values to guarantee `low + 1 < high`. Given the conditions, the safest and most general adjustment would be to ensure that `high` is at least `low + 2`.

State: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `low` is 0 and `high` is equal to `mid` where `mid` is at least 2. Otherwise, `low` is now equal to `mid` and `high` is at least `low + 2`. `st` is a set containing the values `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid`. `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**
