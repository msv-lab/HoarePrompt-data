The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be the next value it should take in the loop. Since `i` was incremented by 1, it should now be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration. `n` remains the same as it is the upper bound of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
