The code snippet calculates the midpoint `mid` between `low` and `high` using integer division. The values of `low` and `high` remain unchanged, and `pos` and `st` are also not affected by this calculation. The new value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.

Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `n - 1`, the value of `mid` becomes `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(n - 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is 0; `high` is `n - 1` where `n` must be greater than 2; `st` is an empty set; `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`.**
