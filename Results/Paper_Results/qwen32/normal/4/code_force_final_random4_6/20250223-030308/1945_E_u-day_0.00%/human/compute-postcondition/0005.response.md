Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `pos` is `i`. The current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `k`.**

In natural language: The value of `pos` has been updated to `i`. All other variables retain their initial conditions: `n` is still greater than 0, `k` and `arr` are still the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is still equal to `k`.
