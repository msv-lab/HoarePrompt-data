Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to rearrange a permutation `p` of size `n` using at most 2 swaps such that after performing a binary search for a given number `x`, the element at index `l` (found by the binary search) is equal to `x`. The binary search algorithm is defined in the problem statement, and it involves maintaining two pointers `l` and `r` and adjusting them based on the middle element `m`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of three functions:
1. `func_1()`: Reads a line of input and splits it into a map of integers.
2. `func_2()`: Reads a line of input, splits it into a map of integers, and converts it into a list.
3. `func_3()`: This is the main function that handles each test case.

Let's break down `func_3()`:
- It reads `n` and `x` (the length of the permutation and the number to find).
- It reads the permutation `arr`.
- It searches for the position `pos` of `x` in `arr`.
- It initializes `low` and `high` pointers for binary search.
- It performs the binary search, adding the middle index `mid` to a set `st` (which is not used further).
- After the loop, it checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `x`. If so, it prints `0` (no swaps needed). Otherwise, it prints `1` (one swap needed) and suggests swapping `low + 1` with `pos + 1`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation does not correctly identify the index `l` that would be returned by the binary search algorithm described in the problem statement. The problem statement specifies that the loop continues until `r - l = 1`, and the final `l` is the one that should be checked against `x`. However, the provided code does not ensure that the final `l` is correctly identified.
2. **Inefficient and Incomplete Swap Logic**: The program suggests a swap only if `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`. However, it does not guarantee that after this swap, the binary search will correctly identify `x` at `l`. The problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, but the provided code does not ensure this with its current logic.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The binary search implementation and the swap logic need to be adjusted to ensure that after at most 2 swaps, the binary search correctly identifies `x` at `l`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
Correctness: **False**
