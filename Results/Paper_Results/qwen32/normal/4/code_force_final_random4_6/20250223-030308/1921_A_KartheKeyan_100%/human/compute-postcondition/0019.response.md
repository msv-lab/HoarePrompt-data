To determine the output of the `print(round(res))` statement, we need to break down the given initial state and understand how the variables are defined and calculated.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` must be a non-zero integer.
- `coord` is a sorted list of the original four tuples \(((x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4))\).
- `res` is calculated as `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`.
- `i` is 3.
- `p1` is \((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2\).
- `p2` is \((coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2\).

### Calculation Steps:
1. **Calculate `p1`:**
   \[
   p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2
   \]
   This represents the squared Euclidean distance between the first two points in the `coord` list.

2. **Calculate `p2`:**
   \[
   p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2
   \]
   This represents the squared Euclidean distance between the last two points in the `coord` list.

3. **Calculate `res`:**
   \[
   res = \sqrt{p1} \times \sqrt{p2}
   \]
   This is the product of the square roots of the squared distances calculated above.

4. **Print the rounded value of `res`:**
   \[
   \text{Output: } \text{round(res)}
   \]
   The final output will be the integer closest to the value of `res`.

### Explanation:
- `coord` is a sorted list of four tuples representing coordinates. The sorting order is not specified, but it doesn't affect the calculation of `p1` and `p2` since they are based on specific pairs of points.
- `p1` and `p2` are the squared distances between the respective pairs of points.
- `res` is the geometric mean of these squared distances.
- The final output is the rounded value of `res`.

### Output:
Since the exact values of the coordinates in `coord` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the rounded value of `res`.

Output: **round(res) (where res is the geometric mean of the squared distances between the specific pairs of points in the `coord` list)**
