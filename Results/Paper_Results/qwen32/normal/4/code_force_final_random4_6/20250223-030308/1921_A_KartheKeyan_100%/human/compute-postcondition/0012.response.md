The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integer inputs from the user, splits the input string by whitespace, converts the split strings to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are already defined as the first and second integer inputs, but these will be overwritten by the new inputs from the user.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing two tuples `((x, y), (x, y))`; `res` is 0; `x` and `y` are the new integer inputs from the user; `i` is 2**.
