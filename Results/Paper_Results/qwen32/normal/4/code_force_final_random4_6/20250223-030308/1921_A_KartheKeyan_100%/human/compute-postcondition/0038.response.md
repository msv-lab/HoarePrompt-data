To determine what will be printed, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
2. `n` is a non-zero integer.
3. `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples: `((x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4))`.
4. `i` is 3.
5. `p1` is calculated as \((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2\).
6. `p2` is calculated as \((coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2\).
7. `res` is calculated as \( \text{math.sqrt(p1)} \times \text{math.sqrt(p2)} \).
8. `x` and `y` are new input integers (though they are not used in the provided code snippet).

### Calculation of `p1` and `p2`:
- `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\).
- `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the points \((x3, y3)\) and \((x4, y4)\).

### Calculation of `res`:
- `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, which is equivalent to the square root of the product of `p1` and `p2`.
- Mathematically, `res = \sqrt{p1} \times \sqrt{p2} = \sqrt{p1 \times p2}`.

### Final Output:
The `print(round(res))` statement will output the rounded value of `res`.

### Explanation:
- Since `p1` and `p2` are squared distances, their product `p1 * p2` represents the product of the squared distances between the pairs of points.
- Taking the square root of `p1 * p2` gives the geometric mean of the distances between the pairs of points.
- The `round(res)` function will round this geometric mean to the nearest integer.

### Final Output Format:
Given the above analysis, the output will be the rounded value of the geometric mean of the distances between the pairs of points specified in the `coord` list.

Output: **rounded value of the geometric mean of the distances between the pairs of points specified in the `coord` list**
