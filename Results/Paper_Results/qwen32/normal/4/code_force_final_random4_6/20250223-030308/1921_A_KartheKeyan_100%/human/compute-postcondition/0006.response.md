The code snippet takes two integer values as input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The values of `t`, `n`, `coord`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is an empty list; `res` is 0; `x` is the first integer input; `y` is the second integer input.**
