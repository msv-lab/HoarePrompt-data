The loop runs for a fixed number of iterations, specifically 4 times. Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, we can determine the final state after all iterations are completed.

Let's break down the loop and how it modifies the state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `n` is a non-zero integer.
   - `coord` is an empty list `[]`.
   - `res` is 0.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `p1` is \((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2\) if `coord` had at least 2 elements before, otherwise `p1` remains unchanged (since `coord` is empty, `p1` remains unchanged).
   - `p2` is \((coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2\) if `coord` had at least 4 elements before, otherwise `p2` remains unchanged (since `coord` is empty, `p2` remains unchanged).
   - `x` and `y` are the new input integers (not yet defined).

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs 4 times, each time appending a new tuple `(x, y)` to `coord`.
   - After the first iteration, `coord` will have 1 element.
   - After the second iteration, `coord` will have 2 elements, and `p1` will be calculated.
   - After the third iteration, `coord` will have 3 elements.
   - After the fourth iteration, `coord` will have 4 elements, and `p2` will be calculated.

3. **Final State:**
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `coord` will contain 4 tuples, each representing the coordinates input during each iteration.
   - `res` remains unchanged at 0.
   - `i` will be 3 after the loop completes (since the loop iterates from 0 to 3 inclusive).
   - `p1` will be the squared distance between the first and second points in `coord`.
   - `p2` will be the squared distance between the third and fourth points in `coord`.
   - `x` and `y` will be the coordinates from the last iteration, but they are not part of the final state as per the problem's requirements.

**Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; n is a non-zero integer; coord is [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]; res is 0; i is 3; p1 is (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2; p2 is (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `coord` will have 4 coordinate tuples, `p1` will be the squared distance between the first two points, `p2` will be the squared distance between the last two points, and all other variables will remain unchanged from their initial state except for `i`, which will be 3.
