Output State: **`times` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case there is an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 <= a_j < 2^31. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `times` is assigned the value of the input integer. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
