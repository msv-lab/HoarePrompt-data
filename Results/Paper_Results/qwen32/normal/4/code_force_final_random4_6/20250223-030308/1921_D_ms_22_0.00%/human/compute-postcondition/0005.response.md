The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. This means that the list `a` will now contain `n` integers, where `n` is specified in the initial state.

The other variables (`t`, `m`, `b_i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `a` and retain the values of the other variables as given in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
