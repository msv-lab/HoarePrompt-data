The code snippet pushes a tuple into `max_heap` using the `heapq.heappush` function. The tuple contains three elements: `-diff1`, `i`, and `0`. Given that `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, and `diff1` is calculated as `abs(i - b[0])`, the tuple that gets pushed into `max_heap` will be `(-abs(i - b[0]), i, 0)`.

The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged by this operation. The only variable that changes is `max_heap`, which now contains the newly pushed tuple.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is at least 1, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing the tuple `(-abs(i - b[0]), i, 0)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `diff1` is greater than `diff2`.**
