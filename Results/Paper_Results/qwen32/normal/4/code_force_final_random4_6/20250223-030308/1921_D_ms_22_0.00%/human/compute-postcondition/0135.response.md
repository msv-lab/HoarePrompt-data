The code snippet provided pops an item from the `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop(max_heap)`. This operation removes and returns the smallest item from the heap, but since the heap is a max-heap (as indicated by the negative sign in the tuples), it effectively removes and returns the tuple with the largest `diff` value (or the smallest `-diff` value).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `-n`
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9
- `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9
- `max_heap` is not empty
- `item` is the tuple `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`
- `ans` is updated based on the conditions

After executing the code snippet, the `max_heap` will have one less element, and `item` will hold the tuple that was popped from the heap. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `-n`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` has one less element, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`, `ans` is updated based on the conditions**.
