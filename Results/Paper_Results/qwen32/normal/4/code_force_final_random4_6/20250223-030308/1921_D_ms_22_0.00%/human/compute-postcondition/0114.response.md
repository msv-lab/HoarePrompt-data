To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `while max_heap:`. This loop will execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is `-n`
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9
- `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9
- `tp1` is 0
- `tp2` is `m - 1`
- `ans` is 0
- `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)`

The only variable in the loop head is `max_heap`. For the loop to execute, `max_heap` must not be empty. Since `max_heap` is initialized with `n` tuples, it should not be empty unless `n` is 0. However, the problem constraints specify that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, so `n` cannot be 0.

Therefore, the initial state already ensures that `max_heap` is not empty, and no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is `-n`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)`**
