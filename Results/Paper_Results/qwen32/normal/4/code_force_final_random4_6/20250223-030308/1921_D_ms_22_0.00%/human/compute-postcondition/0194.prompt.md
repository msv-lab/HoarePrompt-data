Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input and is now sorted.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
    diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
    if diff1 > diff2:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
    else:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `max_heap` is a list containing a tuple. If `diff1` (which is `abs(i - b[0])`) is greater than `diff2` (which is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`), the tuple is `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, the tuple is `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. The variables `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states, with `tp1` being 0, `tp2` being `m - 1`, `ans` being 0, `t` being greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `n` and `m` being integers read from the input, `a` being a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, and `b` being a sorted list of integers read from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `max_heap` is a list containing two tuples. The first tuple is `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` (which is `abs(i - b[0])`) is greater than `diff2` (which is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`), otherwise it is `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. The second tuple is `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, otherwise it is `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. The variables `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, with `tp1` being 0, `tp2` being `m - 1`, `ans` being 0, `t` being greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `n` and `m` being integers read from the input, `a` being a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, and `b` being a sorted list of integers read from the input. `i` is the next element in `a` if there are more elements to process. `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])` and `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `max_heap` is a list containing three tuples. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, the first two tuples are `(-diff1, i_next, 0)` or `(-diff2, i_next, m - 1)` based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, and the third tuple is `(-diff1, i, 0)`. If `diff1` is not greater than `diff2`, the first two tuples are `(-diff1, i_next, 0)` or `(-diff2, i_next, m - 1)` based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, and the third tuple is `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. The variables `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, with `tp1` being 0, `tp2` being `m - 1`, `ans` being 0, `t` being a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` being integers read from the input, `a` being a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, and `b` being a sorted list of integers read from the input. `i` is the next element in `a` if there are more elements to process, denoted as `i_next`. `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])` and `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
