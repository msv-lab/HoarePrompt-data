Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple after the pop operation, `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, `tp1` is updated to `tp1 + 1` if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `tp1` remains the same, `tp2` is updated to `tp2 - 1` if `diff1 <= diff2`, otherwise `tp2` remains the same, and `ans` is increased by `diff1` if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `ans` is increased by `diff2`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is updated to `ans - item[0]`. If `item[2] == tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.**
