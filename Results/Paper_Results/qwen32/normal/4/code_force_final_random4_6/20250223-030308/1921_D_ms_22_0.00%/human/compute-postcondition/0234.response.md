The code snippet `ans += diff1` adds the value of `diff1` to the variable `ans`. The values of `max_heap`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `item`, `diff1`, `diff2`, and `tp1` remain unchanged as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)` (one less than before), `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was the smallest in `max_heap` before the pop operation, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1 - 1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, `tp1` is incremented by 1, `ans` is increased by `diff1`.**
