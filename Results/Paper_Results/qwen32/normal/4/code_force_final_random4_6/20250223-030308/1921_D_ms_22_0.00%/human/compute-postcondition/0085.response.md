The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state indicates that `n` and `m` are integers with specific constraints, but the values of `n` and `m` are not provided directly in the initial state. After executing the code, `n` and `m` will hold the values provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is an integer between 0 and `m`, `tp2` is an integer between 0 and `m`, and `ans` is the accumulated sum of the largest differences found during the loop.**
