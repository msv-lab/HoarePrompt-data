To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand how the variable `ans` is derived. However, the provided initial state does not include any code that modifies the value of `ans`. Therefore, based on the given information, we can only conclude that `ans` is initialized to some value, but we do not have information about what that value is or how it might change.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99.
- `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
- `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9.
- `max_heap` is an empty list.
- `tp1` is an integer between 0 and `m`.
- `tp2` is an integer between 0 and `m`.
- `ans` is the accumulated sum of the largest differences found during the loop.

Since there is no code provided to modify `ans`, we can only assume that `ans` retains its initial value, which is not specified in the initial state. Typically, in such scenarios, if a variable is declared but not assigned a specific value, it might be initialized to 0 by default in many programming contexts, but this is not explicitly stated here.

Given the lack of further information about the initial value of `ans` or any code that modifies it, the most precise description we can provide is that `ans` is the accumulated sum of the largest differences found during the loop, but since no loop or modification to `ans` is provided, we can only assume it retains its initial value.

Output: **ans (where ans is the accumulated sum of the largest differences found during the loop, and its initial value is not specified)**

However, if we assume the common default initialization of 0 for such variables in Python, the output would be:

Output: **0**
