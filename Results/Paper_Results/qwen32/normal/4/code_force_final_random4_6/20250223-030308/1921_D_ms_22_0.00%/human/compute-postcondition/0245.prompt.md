Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5. `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The current execution context is the main program (i.e., `__name__ == '__main__'`).
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b.sort()
    max_heap = []
    tp1 = 0
    tp2 = m - 1
    ans = 0
    for i in a:
        diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
        diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
        else:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))
    while max_heap:
        item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
            diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
            diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
            if diff1 > diff2:
                tp1 += 1
                ans += diff1
            else:
                tp2 -= 1
                ans += diff2
        else:
            ans += -item[0]
            if item[2] == tp1:
                tp1 += 1
            else:
                tp2 -= 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is an integer between 0 and `m`, `tp2` is an integer between 0 and `m`, and `ans` is the accumulated sum of the largest differences found during the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted indices, `ans` is the sum of the minimum differences.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` and `tp2` are updated positions in `b`, `ans` is the sum of the largest differences calculated, `t` is 0, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
