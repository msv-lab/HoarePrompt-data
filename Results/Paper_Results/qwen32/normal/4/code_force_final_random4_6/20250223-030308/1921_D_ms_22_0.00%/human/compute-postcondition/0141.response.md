The code snippet `ans += diff2` updates the value of `ans` by adding `diff2` to it. None of the other variables are modified by this line of code. The value of `ans` will be the previous value of `ans` plus `diff2`.

Output State: **`t` is `-n`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` has one less element, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff2`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, `tp2` is `tp2 - 1`.**
