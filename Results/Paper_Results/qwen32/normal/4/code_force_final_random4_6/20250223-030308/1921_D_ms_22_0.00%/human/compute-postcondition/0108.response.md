The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the current element `i` from list `a` and the first element `b[0]` from the sorted list `b`. This value is assigned to the variable `diff1`.

Given the initial state, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, and `b[0]` is the first element of the sorted list `b`. The calculation of `diff1` does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `max_heap`, or the condition involving `diff1` and `diff2` used to populate `max_heap`. The only change is the introduction of the new variable `diff1`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, if `diff1` (the absolute difference between `a[t]` and `b[0]`) is greater than `diff2` (the absolute difference between `a[t]` and `b[m - 1]`), `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, a[t], 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, a[t], m - 1)`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`.**
