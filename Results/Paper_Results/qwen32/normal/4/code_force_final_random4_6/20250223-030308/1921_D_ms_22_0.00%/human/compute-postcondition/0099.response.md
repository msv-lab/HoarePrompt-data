The code snippet pushes a tuple into `max_heap` using `heapq.heappush`. The tuple consists of `-diff2`, `i`, and `m - 1`. Since `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`, `-diff2` will be a negative value, and it will be used as the key for the heap, ensuring that the largest `diff2` (smallest `-diff2`) will have the highest priority.

The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, and the condition `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2` remain unchanged. The only change is that `max_heap` now contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`**.
