Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, each tuple being `(-abs(a_i - b[0]), a_i, 0)` or `(-abs(a_i - b[m - 1]), a_i, m - 1)` depending on the comparison, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is 0.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the `max_heap` will contain `n` tuples. Each tuple represents the maximum absolute difference between an element in list `a` and either the smallest or largest element in the sorted list `b`, along with the respective element from `a` and the index in `b` that was used in the comparison. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states, except for `max_heap` which now holds all the computed differences.
