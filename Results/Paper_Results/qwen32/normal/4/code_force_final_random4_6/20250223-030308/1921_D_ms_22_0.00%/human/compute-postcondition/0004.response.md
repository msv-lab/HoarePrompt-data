The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are integers within specific ranges, but their exact values are not provided until runtime. After executing the code, `n` and `m` will hold the values provided by the input, and all other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
