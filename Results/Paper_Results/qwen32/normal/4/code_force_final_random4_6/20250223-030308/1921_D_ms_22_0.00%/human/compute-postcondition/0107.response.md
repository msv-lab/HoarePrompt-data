The loop provided in the task is:

```python
for i in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, focusing only on the variables in the loop head, which is `i` in this case.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9
- `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9
- `tp1` is 0
- `tp2` is `m - 1`
- `ans` is 0
- If `diff1` (the absolute difference between `a[t]` and `b[0]`) is greater than `diff2` (the absolute difference between `a[t]` and `b[m - 1]`), `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, a[t], 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, a[t], m - 1)`.

Since the loop iterates over `a`, the variable `i` will take the next value from the list `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been the current element being processed from `a`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in the list `a`.

The state of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, and `max_heap` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, if `diff1` (the absolute difference between `a[t]` and `b[0]`) is greater than `diff2` (the absolute difference between `a[t]` and `b[m - 1]`), `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, a[t], 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, a[t], m - 1)`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`**
