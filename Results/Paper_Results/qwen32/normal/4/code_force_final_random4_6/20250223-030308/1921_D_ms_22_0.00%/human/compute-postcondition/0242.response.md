Postcondition: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)` (one less than before), `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was the smallest in `max_heap` before the pop operation. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, `ans` is increased by `diff1` if `diff1 > diff2` else `ans` is increased by `diff2`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1 - 1])` if `diff1 > diff2` else `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `tp2` is decremented by 1. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff`.**
