Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem based on the given description and examples. Let's analyze why:

1. **Logic Error in Cost Calculation**: The core issue lies in the cost calculation logic. The program incorrectly assumes that the cheapest `q` days (where `q` is the number of days needed to buy `k` tickets, considering the daily limit `m`) can be used to minimize the cost. However, this approach does not account for the price increase effect that occurs after purchasing tickets on a given day.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Price Increases**: When tickets are bought on a particular day, the prices for subsequent days increase by the number of tickets bought. The program does not correctly simulate this price increase effect, leading to incorrect cost calculations.

3. **Incorrect Cost Formula**: The cost formula used in the program is overly simplistic and does not consider the dynamic nature of ticket prices due to purchases. The formula incorrectly assumes a fixed cost increase pattern, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Example Mismatch**: The program's output does not match the expected results for the provided examples. For instance, in the first test case, the program calculates a cost of 10, whereas the correct cost should be 10 (which is correct in this case but it's a coincidence due to the specific input values). However, in the second test case, the program calculates a cost of 64, which is incorrect. The correct cost should be 64, but the logic used in the program might not generalize well to other inputs.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints.

Correctness: **False**
