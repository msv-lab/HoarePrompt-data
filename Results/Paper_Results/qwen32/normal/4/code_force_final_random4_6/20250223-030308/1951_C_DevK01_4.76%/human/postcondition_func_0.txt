The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a cost based on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the sorted list of integers. The input values remain unchanged throughout the execution of each test case.
