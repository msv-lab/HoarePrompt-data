Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `q-1`, `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `M` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**

In this output state, the value of `cost` has been updated to include the additional terms specified in the code snippet. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the precondition.
