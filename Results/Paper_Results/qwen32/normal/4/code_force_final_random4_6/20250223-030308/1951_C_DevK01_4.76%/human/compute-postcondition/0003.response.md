The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `M`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `M` is a list of integers read from the input.**
