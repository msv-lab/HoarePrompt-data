Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer; `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `len(N)`, `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, and `M` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. If `n * m` equals `k`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `n` is `q-1`, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `n` is `q - 1`. `L` is a new list of integers read from the input, `m` is `min(m, k)`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `M` is a new sorted list of integers read from the input, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element. `cost` is recalculated based on the new values of `L` and `M`. If `n * m == k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `q` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `n` is `q - 1`, `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`, `k` is `L[2]`, `L` is a new list of integers read from the input, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / min(L[1], L[2])))`, `M` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. If `n * m == k`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((q - 1) * q // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` except the last one, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
