Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads a new list `L` containing `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a new list `M` of integers. It calculates the cost based on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the sorted list `M`. The cost is printed for each iteration. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged throughout the loop.**

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the program will have processed `t` different sets of inputs. For each set, it reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the second line contains a list of integers `M`. It then calculates the cost based on these inputs and prints the cost. The initial values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not modified by the loop.
