The value of `m` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `k`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `L`, `k`, `q`, `M`, `N`, and `cost`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is `L[0]`, `L` is a new list of integers read from the input, `m` is `min(m, k)`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `M` is a new sorted list of integers read from the input, and `N` and `cost` are recalculated based on the new values of `L` and `M`.**
