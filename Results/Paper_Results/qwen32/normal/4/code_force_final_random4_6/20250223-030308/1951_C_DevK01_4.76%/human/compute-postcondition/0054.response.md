Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `q` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `n` is `q - 1`. `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`, `k` is `L[2]`, `L` is a new list of integers read from the input, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / min(L[1], L[2])))`, `M` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. If `n * m == k`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((q - 1) * q // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` except the last one, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
