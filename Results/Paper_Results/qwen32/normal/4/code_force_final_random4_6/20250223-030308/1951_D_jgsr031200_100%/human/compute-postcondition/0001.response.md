The `print('YES')` statement in the provided code snippet is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes the values of `n` and `k` but does not affect the output of this specific print statement because the string `'YES'` is hardcoded and does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state tells us that `n` and `k` are positive integers and are equal to each other.
2. However, the `print('YES')` statement does not use `n` or `k` in any way; it simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **YES**
