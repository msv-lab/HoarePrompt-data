The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes `n` and `k` as positive integers where `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}` and that `n` is currently equal to `k`. However, the `print` statement does not reference these variables `n` and `k` at all. Therefore, the values of `n` and `k` are irrelevant to the output of the `print` statement.

The `print(1)` statement will simply output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
