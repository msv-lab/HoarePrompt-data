The value of `curr` is updated to the result of the integer division of `n` by `i`. Given that `n` is 0 and `i` is 1, `curr` becomes `0 // 1`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is a list `[1 - k, 1]`, `h` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` is 1**
