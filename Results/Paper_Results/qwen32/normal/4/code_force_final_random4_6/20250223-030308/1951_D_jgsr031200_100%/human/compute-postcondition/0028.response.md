The `print('YES')` statement will output the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `costs`, `h`, `curr`, or `i`. The print statement is a simple output statement that does not depend on any of the variables defined in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state provides values and conditions for several variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `h`, `curr`, `i`), but these are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print('YES')` statement explicitly prints the string 'YES'.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
