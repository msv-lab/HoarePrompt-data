The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `h`, `curr`, and `i`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}.
   - `costs` is a list `[1 - k, 1]`.
   - `h` is the value of `n // (n - k + 1)` from the first iteration.
   - `curr` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `h` is less than `k`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The `print('NO')` statement directly prints the string `'NO'` to the console.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, the output will be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
