Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed by the `print(*costs)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `costs` is a list `[1 - k, 1]`.
- `h` is the value of `n // (n - k + 1)` from the first iteration, but this value is not relevant for the current `print` statement.
- `curr` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, but this condition is not directly relevant to the `costs` list.

### Analysis:
The `costs` list is explicitly defined as `[1 - k, 1]`. To determine the values in the list:
- The first element is `1 - k`.
- The second element is `1`.

Since `k` is a positive integer and can be as large as \(10^{18}\), the first element `1 - k` will be a very large negative number. For example, if `k` were 1, the first element would be 0. If `k` were 2, the first element would be -1, and so on.

### Output:
The `print(*costs)` statement will print the elements of the `costs` list separated by spaces. Based on the definition of the `costs` list, the output will be `1 - k` followed by `1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 - k, 1** (where `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\))
