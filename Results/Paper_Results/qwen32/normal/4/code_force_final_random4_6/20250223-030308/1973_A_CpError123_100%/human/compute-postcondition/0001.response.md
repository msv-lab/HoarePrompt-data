The only variable in the loop head of the provided for loop is `_` and `t`. The variable `_` is a conventional name used in Python for a loop variable that we do not intend to use inside the loop. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because `range(t)` will generate an empty sequence if `t` is 0, and thus the loop will not execute.

The state of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are not relevant to whether the loop will execute, as they are not part of the loop head. They will be used inside the loop body, but we are only concerned with the loop head variables here.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
