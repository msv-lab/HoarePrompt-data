The function `func` accepts three integer parameters `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`, representing the scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order. The function is called for each of the `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases and satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. Each score is within the range 0 to 30 inclusive.

Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. It processes these scores for each of the `t` test cases and returns a result based on the scores provided.**
