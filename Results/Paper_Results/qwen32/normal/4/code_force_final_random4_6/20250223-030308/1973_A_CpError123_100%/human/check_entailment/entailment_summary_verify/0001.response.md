### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the problem and the provided program to ensure its correctness based on the given function summary and examples.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Game Scoring**:
  - A win gives 2 points to the winner.
  - A draw gives 1 point to each player (total 2 points).
  - The total points among all players must be even because each game contributes exactly 2 points.

- **Constraints**:
  - Scores are sorted in non-decreasing order: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
  - Scores are integers between 0 and 30.

- **Objective**:
  - Determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened.
  - If the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games, return -1.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:

1. **Check Total Points Evenness**:
   - It checks if the sum of the scores \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) is odd. If it is, it outputs `-1` because an odd total score is impossible with the given scoring rules.

2. **Calculate Maximum Possible Draws**:
   - It calculates two values:
     - \( x = \frac{p_1 + p_2 + p_3}{2} \) which represents the total number of games played.
     - \( y = p_1 + p_2 \) which represents the maximum number of draws involving the first two players.
   - It then outputs the smaller of these two values, \( \text{min}(x, y) \).

#### Validation with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: 0 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{0}{2}, 0 \right) = 0 \)
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: 2 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{2}{2}, 1 \right) = 1 \)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: 3 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: 4 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{4}{2}, 2 \right) = 2 \)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: 9 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Example 6**:
   - Input: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{12}{2}, 7 \right) = 6 \)
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Example 7**:
   - Input: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{12}{2}, 2 \right) = 2 \)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Additional Verification:
To further ensure correctness, let's consider edge cases:

- **No Games Played**:
  - Input: `0 0 0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **All Draws**:
  - Input: `1 1 1`
  - Output: `-1` (Correct, as 3 points cannot be evenly distributed among 3 games with draws)

- **Mixed Wins and Draws**:
  - Input: `2 2 4`
  - Total points: 8 (even)
  - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{8}{2}, 4 \right) = 4 \)
  - Output: `4` (Correct)

- **Impossible Scores**:
  - Input: `1 1 10`
  - Total points: 12 (even)
  - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{12}{2}, 2 \right) = 2 \)
  - Output: `2` (Correct, as the maximum possible draws involving the first two players is 2)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identify inconsistent scores. It handles all edge cases and examples correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
