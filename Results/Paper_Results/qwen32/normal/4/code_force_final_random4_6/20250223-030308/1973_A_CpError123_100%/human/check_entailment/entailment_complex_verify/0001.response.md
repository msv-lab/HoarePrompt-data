Reasoning: The original assessment provides a thorough analysis of the problem and the program logic. It correctly identifies that the total points must be even for the scores to be consistent with a valid set of games. The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws, `min((a + b + c) // 2, a + b)`, is also accurate and aligns with the problem constraints. The assessment validates the program with various examples, and the outcomes match the expected results. Therefore, the original assessment appears to be accurate.

Final: **True**
