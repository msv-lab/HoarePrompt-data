Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input.
- The sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It prints the integer `-1` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. The condition that the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd does not affect the execution of this `print` statement.

### Output:
The code will print `-1`.

Output: **-1**
