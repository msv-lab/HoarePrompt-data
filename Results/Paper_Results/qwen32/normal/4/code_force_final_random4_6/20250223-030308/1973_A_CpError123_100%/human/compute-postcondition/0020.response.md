The `print(-1)` statement will output the integer `-1` regardless of the values of `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y` as these variables are not used in the print statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `_` is 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from input.
- `x` is calculated as `(a + b + c) // 2`.
- `y` is calculated as `a + b`.

However, the print statement only contains `-1`, so the values of all the other variables do not affect the output.

Output: **-1**
