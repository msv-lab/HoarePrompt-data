The provided Python code snippet contains a `print(-1)` statement. This statement is independent of the variables `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, and `c` mentioned in the initial state. The value to be printed is explicitly given in the `print` function.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, but none of these are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the value `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
