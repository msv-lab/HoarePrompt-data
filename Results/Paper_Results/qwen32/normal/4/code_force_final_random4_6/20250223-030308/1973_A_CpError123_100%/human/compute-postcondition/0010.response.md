The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since the loop iterates `t` times, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1 and the loop will continue as long as `_` is less than `t`.

Given that `t` is greater than or equal to 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` should be incremented by 1 and `t` should remain the same (as it determines the total number of iterations).

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`; `y` is `a + b`; `_` is incremented by 1**.

However, since we are only supposed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, the adjusted state should only include `_` and `t`. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y` do not change in the loop head.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `_` is incremented by 1**

Since `_` is a dummy variable and its value is not explicitly tracked or used outside the loop, we can represent the state of `_` simply as it being ready for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `_` is the next iteration counter**
