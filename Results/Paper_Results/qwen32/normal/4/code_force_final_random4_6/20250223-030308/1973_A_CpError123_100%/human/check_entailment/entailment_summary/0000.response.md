### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players in a series of chess games. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Sum of Scores Parity Check:**
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1`. This is based on the fact that each game contributes either 2 points (one player wins) or 2 points (both players draw), meaning the total points accumulated across all games must be even. If the sum of the scores is odd, no valid set of games could result in those scores, so the program correctly outputs `-1`.

2. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates two values:
     - `x = (a + b + c) // 2`: This represents the total number of games played because each game contributes 2 points.
     - `y = a + b`: This represents the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores. It is used to determine the maximum possible number of draws.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`, which is intended to represent the maximum number of draws. However, this logic is flawed.

3. **Flaw in Logic:**
   - The logic `min(x, y)` does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws. The maximum number of draws is not simply the minimum of the total number of games and the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores. This is because the distribution of wins and draws among the players is more complex and cannot be accurately inferred from these simple calculations alone.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the example input `1 1 10`:

- `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 10`
- `a + b + c = 12` (even, so we proceed)
- `x = (1 + 1 + 10) // 2 = 6`
- `y = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `min(x, y) = 2`

The program outputs `2`, but this is incorrect. The correct maximum number of draws for this scenario is `1` (with the remaining points distributed as wins). The program's logic fails to account for the distribution of wins and draws in a way that respects the given scores.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program's logic for determining the maximum number of draws is flawed. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
