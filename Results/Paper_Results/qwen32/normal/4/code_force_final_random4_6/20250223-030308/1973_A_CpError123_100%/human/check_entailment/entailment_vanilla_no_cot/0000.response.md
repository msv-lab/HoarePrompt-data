To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on the given scores of the three players, or correctly identifies when the scores are inconsistent.

Let's break down the logic in the program:

1. **Input Parsing and Loop**: The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the scores \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \).

2. **Sum of Scores Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) is even. If it's not, it prints `-1` because the total points awarded in a game (2 for a win, 2 for a draw) must always be even.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - The variable `x` is calculated as \( \frac{p_1 + p_2 + p_3}{2} \). This represents the total number of games played, because each game contributes 2 points to the total score.
   - The variable `y` is calculated as \( p_1 + p_2 \). This represents the total points that the two players with the lowest scores have together.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `x` and `y` as the maximum number of draws.

The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is based on the observation that the maximum number of draws is limited by the total number of games and the points accumulated by the two players with the lowest scores. However, this logic is not fully correct.

**Key Issues**:
- The program does not correctly account for the possibility that the scores might be inconsistent even if the sum of scores is even. For example, the scores (1, 1, 1) cannot be achieved because it would require at least two games, but the total points would be 4, not 3.
- The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws does not consider the possibility of different combinations of wins and draws leading to the same total scores. For example, the scores (3, 4, 5) can be achieved with 6 games, but the program's logic might not correctly identify this.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

**Conclusion**:
Correctness: **False**
