Postcondition: **`ans` is `x - 2 + number_of_times_condition_is_true`, `gaps` is either `[gap]` if it was empty or `[gap1, gap2, ..., gap]` if it contained `[gap1, gap2, ..., gapn]` before, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `next_elem` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 0, `gap` is added to the `gaps` list.**
