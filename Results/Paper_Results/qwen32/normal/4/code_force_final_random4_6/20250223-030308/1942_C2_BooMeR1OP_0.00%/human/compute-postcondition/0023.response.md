The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `gaps`. This action does not affect the value of `ans`, which remains as `x - 2 + number_of_times_condition_is_true`. Therefore, the output state includes the previously defined `ans` expression and the newly initialized `gaps` list.

Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2 + number_of_times_condition_is_true`, `gaps` is an empty list.**
