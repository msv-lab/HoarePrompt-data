Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2 + number_of_times_condition_is_true`, `gaps` is a list containing all positive gaps calculated during the loop iterations.**

**Natural Language Explanation:**
After the loop has executed all `x` iterations, the variable `ans` remains as `x - 2` plus the number of times the condition `gap > 0` was true during the loop. The `gaps` list will contain all the positive gaps calculated for each iteration where the difference between `next_elem` and `a[i]` minus 1 was greater than 0. The values of `x`, `a`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `i` will have cycled through all values from 0 to `x-1`.
