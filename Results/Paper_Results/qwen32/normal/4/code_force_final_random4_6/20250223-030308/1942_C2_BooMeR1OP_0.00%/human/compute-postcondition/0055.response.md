The code snippet `ans += 2 * y` increments the variable `ans` by `2 * y`. The initial state describes `ans` in terms of other variables and conditions, but the only variable affected by this line is `ans` itself. The values of `gaps`, `pairs`, `gap`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2 + number_of_times_condition_is_true` plus either `gap` if `y >= pairs`, or `2 * y` if `y < pairs`, plus `2 * y`; `gaps` remains a non-empty sorted list; `pairs` is `gap // 2`; `gap` is the next element in `gaps`.**
