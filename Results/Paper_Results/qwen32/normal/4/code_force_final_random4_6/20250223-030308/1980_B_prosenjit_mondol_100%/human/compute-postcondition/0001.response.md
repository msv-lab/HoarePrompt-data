The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, which is the input to `int(input())`. However, this value of `t` is not used in the given code snippet. Therefore, the value of `t` remains unchanged.

After the execution of the code snippet:
- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `f` is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `k` is assigned the third integer from the input.

The output state will include the updated values of `n`, `f`, and `k`, while `t` retains its original value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input.**
