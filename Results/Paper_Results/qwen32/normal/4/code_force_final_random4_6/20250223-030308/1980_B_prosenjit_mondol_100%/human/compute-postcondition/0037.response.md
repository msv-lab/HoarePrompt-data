To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the variables involved and the conditions in the statement.

Here's the breakdown of the variables and conditions:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\). This variable is not directly used in the `print` statement.
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `f` is the second integer from the new input minus 1.
- `k` is the third integer from the new input minus 1.
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input and sorted in descending order.
- `x` is the element at index `f` in the list `a`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')
```

Let's break down the conditions:
1. **Condition 1**: `k == n - 1`
   - This checks if `k` is the last index of the list `a`. If true, it means `k` points to the last element in the sorted list `a`.

2. **Condition 2**: `a[k + 1] < x`
   - This checks if the element at index `k + 1` in the list `a` is less than the element at index `f`. Since `a` is sorted in descending order, this condition checks if the next element in the list is smaller than `x`.

The print statement will output 'YES' if either of the above conditions is true, otherwise it will print 'MAYBE'.

### Output Explanation:
- **Output 'YES'**:
  - If `k == n - 1`, it means `k` is pointing to the last element of the list `a`, and thus, there is no next element to compare. In this case, the condition `a[k + 1] < x` is not evaluated because the first condition is true.
  - If `a[k + 1] < x`, it means the next element in the sorted list `a` is smaller than `x`, which is consistent with the descending order of the list.

- **Output 'MAYBE'**:
  - If neither `k == n - 1` nor `a[k + 1] < x` is true, it means `k` is not the last index, and the element at index `k + 1` is not smaller than `x`. This implies that `x` is not larger than the next element in the sorted list, which is unexpected in a strictly descending order unless `x` is the same as the next element.

Given the information and the conditions, the output of the print statement can be either 'YES' or 'MAYBE' based on the values of `k`, `n`, `f`, and the elements in the list `a`.

Output: **'YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE'**
