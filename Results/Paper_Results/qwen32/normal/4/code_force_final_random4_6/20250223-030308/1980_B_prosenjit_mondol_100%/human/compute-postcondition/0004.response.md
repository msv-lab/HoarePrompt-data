The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `f`, or `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `k` is the third integer from the input minus 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
