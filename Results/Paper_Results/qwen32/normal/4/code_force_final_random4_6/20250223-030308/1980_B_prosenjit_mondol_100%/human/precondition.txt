t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case and is structured as follows: (n, f, k, a), with n, f, k being integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a being a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100.
