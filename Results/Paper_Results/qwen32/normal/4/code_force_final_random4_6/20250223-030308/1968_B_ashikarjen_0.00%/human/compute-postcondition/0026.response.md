To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the conditions under which the loop continues to execute and when it terminates.

The loop:
```python
while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
    j += 1
```
will continue to increment `j` until either:
1. `j` is no longer less than `m`, or
2. `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, the loop has been executing because `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]` for `j` values of 0, 1, and 2. This means that `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are not equal to `a[0]`.

The loop will terminate when either `j` reaches `m` or `b[j]` equals `a[i]`. Since the loop has executed 3 times, `j` is currently 3. If `j` is still less than `m` and `b[3]` is not equal to `a[0]`, the loop will continue. However, if `j` is equal to `m` or `b[3]` is equal to `a[0]`, the loop will terminate.

Let's consider the two scenarios:
1. If `j` is equal to `m`, the loop will terminate, and `j` will remain `m`.
2. If `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` equals `a[0]`, the loop will terminate, and `j` will be the index where `b[j]` equals `a[0]`.

Given that the loop has executed 3 times, the most general conclusion we can make without additional information about the values of `b` and `a` is that `j` will be 3 if `b[3]` is not equal to `a[0]` and `j` will be the index where `b[j]` equals `a[0]` if such an index exists and is less than `m`.

Since the problem does not provide further details about the values of `a` and `b`, we assume the most straightforward case where `j` continues to increment until it reaches `m` or finds a match. Given the provided information, the most likely final state is that `j` has reached `m` if no match was found within the first `m` elements.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input; `i` is -1; `j` is m.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations, `j` will be equal to `m` if no match was found between `b[j]` and `a[i]` within the first `m` elements of `b`.
