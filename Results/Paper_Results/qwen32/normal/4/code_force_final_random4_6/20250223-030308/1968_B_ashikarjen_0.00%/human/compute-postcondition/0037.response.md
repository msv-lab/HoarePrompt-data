The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a non-empty binary string input; `b` is a non-empty binary string input such that `b[1]` is not equal to `a[0]`; `i` is 0; `j` is 2**
