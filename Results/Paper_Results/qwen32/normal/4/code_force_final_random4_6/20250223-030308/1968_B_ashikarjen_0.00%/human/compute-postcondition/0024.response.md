To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop statement. The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:

1. `j < m`
2. `b[j] != a[i]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `m` must be greater than 1
- `a` is the new binary string input
- `b` is the new binary string input
- `i` is -1
- `j` is 2
- `b[0]` is not equal to `a[0]`

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. **Condition `j < m`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`. Since `m` is greater than 1, and `j` is currently 2, we need to ensure `m` is at least 3 (so `j < m` holds true).

2. **Condition `b[j] != a[i]`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is -1.
   - Since `i` is -1, `a[i]` is out of bounds for the string `a` (assuming 0-based indexing). However, in the context of the loop, we need to ensure that `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`. Since `i` is -1, this condition is effectively always true because `a[-1]` is not a valid element in the string `a`.

Given that `i` is -1, the second condition (`b[j] != a[i]`) does not need adjustment because `a[-1]` is not a valid element, and thus the condition is trivially true.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `m` to ensure `j < m` holds true.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `m` must be at least 3; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input; `i` is -1; `j` is 2; `b[0]` is not equal to `a[0]`**
