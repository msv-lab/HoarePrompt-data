You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Output

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two binary strings `a` and `b`. For each test case, it determines the maximum number of characters from `a` that can be found in `b` in the same order and prints this count.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum length `k` such that the prefix of string `a` from the beginning to the `k`-th character is a subsequence of string `b`.
   - A subsequence means that characters of `a` can appear in `b` in the same order, but not necessarily consecutively.

2. **Approach in the Given Program:**
   - The program initializes `k` to 0, which will count the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
   - It also initializes `j` to 0, which will be used to traverse string `b`.
   - For each character in string `a` (using a for loop), it tries to find the same character in `b` starting from the current position `j` (using a while loop).
   - If the character from `a` is found in `b`, it increments `k` and moves `j` to the next position in `b`.
   - If the character from `a` is not found in the remaining part of `b`, it breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `k`.

3. **Verification of the Program:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
   - It uses a two-pointer technique where `i` traverses `a` and `j` traverses `b`.
   - The program efficiently checks for each character of `a` if it can be matched with a subsequent character in `b` in a sequential manner.
   - The while loop inside the for loop ensures that the program continues to search for the next matching character in `b` until it either finds it or exhausts `b`.
   - The program handles all edge cases, such as when `a` is longer than `b`, when `a` and `b` have no common characters, and when `a` is a subsequence of `b` in its entirety.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program correctly solves the problem as per the given requirements and constraints.
