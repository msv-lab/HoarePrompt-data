Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `m` must be greater than 1; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input; `i` is -1; `j` is 2; `b[0]` is not equal to `a[0]`**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` changes from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
