The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and the condition `0 ≤ j < m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input; `k` is 1; `j` is the smallest integer such that `b[j] == a[i]` and `0 ≤ j < m`, but now `j` has been incremented by 1.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input; `k` is 1; `j` is the smallest integer such that `b[j] == a[i]` and `0 ≤ j < m`, incremented by 1.**
