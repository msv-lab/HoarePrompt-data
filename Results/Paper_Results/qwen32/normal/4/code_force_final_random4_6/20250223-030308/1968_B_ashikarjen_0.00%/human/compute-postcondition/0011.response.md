Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `m` must be greater than 3; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input such that `b[0] != a[0]` and `b[3] != a[i]`; `k` is 0; `j` is 4.**

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
