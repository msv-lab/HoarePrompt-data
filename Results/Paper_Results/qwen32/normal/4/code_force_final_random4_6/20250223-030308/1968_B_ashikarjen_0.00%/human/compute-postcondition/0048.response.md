To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` and `b` are binary strings of lengths `n` and `m` respectively.
- `k` is the number of characters from `a` found in `b` in order.
- `j` is the index in `b` where the search stopped (either `m` if the loop broke early or the index right after the last matched character if all characters were found).

### The Print Statement:
```
print(k)
```

### Analysis:
The variable `k` is defined as the number of characters from the binary string `a` that can be found in the binary string `b` in order. This implies that we are essentially looking for a subsequence of `a` within `b`. The value of `k` will be the length of the longest subsequence of `a` that appears in `b` in the same order.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `k`. However, based on the problem's structure, `k` will be the count of characters from `a` that appear in `b` in the same order.

### Output:
The `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`, which is the number of characters from the binary string `a` found in the binary string `b` in order.

Output: **k (where k is the number of characters from the binary string `a` found in the binary string `b` in order)**
