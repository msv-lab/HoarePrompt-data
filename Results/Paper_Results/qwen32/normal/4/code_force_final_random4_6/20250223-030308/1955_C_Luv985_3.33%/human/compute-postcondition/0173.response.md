Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is non-zero and `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is the list of integers from the input with the first element decreased by `mi` and the last element decreased by `mi`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` (original) and `a[n-1]`, `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`.**

Natural Language: The value of `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`. All other variables remain unchanged with their initial constraints and values.
