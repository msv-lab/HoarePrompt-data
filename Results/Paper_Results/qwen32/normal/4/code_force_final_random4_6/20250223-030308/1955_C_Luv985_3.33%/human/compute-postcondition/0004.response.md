The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n` and `k`. Since `input().split()` returns a list of strings, `n` and `k` will be strings. The values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is 0; `n` is a string; `k` is a string.**
