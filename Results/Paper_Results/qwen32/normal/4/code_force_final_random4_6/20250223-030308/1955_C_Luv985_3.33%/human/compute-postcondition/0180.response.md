The value of `t` is assigned the result of `k % 2`. This means `t` will be 0 if `k` is even and 1 if `k` is odd. The values of `n`, `k`, `T`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `mi` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is non-zero and `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is the list of integers from the input, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is `k % 2`**.
