Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 5; `T` is non-zero and decreased by 1; `n` is the first part of the input as an integer; `k` is the second part of the input as an integer; `a` is the list of integers from the input; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 5 if `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise `t` is `k % 2`. `T` is non-zero and has been decreased by 1. `n` is greater than 1. `k` is greater than 0 and decreased by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`. `a` is the list of integers from the input with the first element reduced by `mi` and the last element further reduced by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. `r` is `n - 2` if `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `r` is `n - 1`. `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n-1])`. `l` is 1 if `a[l]` is 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `l` remains 0. `ans` is 1 if `a[l]` is 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, or if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0 and `mi * 2 > k`; otherwise, `ans` is 2 if `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 5 if `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise `t` is `k % 2`. `T` is non-zero and has been decreased by 1. `n` is greater than 1. `k` is greater than 0 and decreased by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`. `a` is the list of integers from the input with the first element reduced by `2 * mi` and the last element further reduced by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`; otherwise, the first element is reduced by `mi`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, the element at index `r` in `a` is reduced by `mi`. If `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, then `r` is `n - 3` and `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `r` is `n - 2`. `mi` is `min(a[0], a[r])`. If `a[l] == 0`, then `l` is 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1 from its initial value. Otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `ans` retains its initial value. If `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` is `ans + 1` if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is 5 if `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise `t` is `k % 2`. `T` is non-zero and has been decreased by 1. `n` is greater than 1. `k` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`. `a` is the list of integers from the input with the first element reduced by `2 * mi` and the last element further reduced by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`; otherwise, the first element is reduced by `mi`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, the element at index `r` in `a` is reduced by `mi`. If `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, then `r` is `n - 3` and `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `r` is `n - 2`. `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`. If `a[l] == 0`, then `l` is set to 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1 from its initial value. Otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `ans` retains its initial value. If `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `a[l] == 0`, `l` is set to 1, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `mi` is recalculated as `min(a[l], a[r])`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `k` is further decreased by `mi * 2`, and `ans` is incremented by 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`; otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
