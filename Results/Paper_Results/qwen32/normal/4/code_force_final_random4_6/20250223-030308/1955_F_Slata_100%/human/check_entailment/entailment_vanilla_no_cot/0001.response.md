To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The game revolves around the bitwise XOR of a sequence of integers. Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero, and Bob wins if the XOR is zero. Eve aims to maximize Bob's wins by removing numbers optimally.

The numbers in the sequence are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4. The XOR of these numbers has specific properties:
- XOR of two identical numbers is 0.
- XOR of 1 and 3 is 2, and vice versa.
- XOR of 2 and 4 is 0.
- XOR of 1 and 2 is 3.
- XOR of 1 and 4 is 5 (which is 1 in 4-bit representation).
- XOR of 3 and 4 is 7 (which is 3 in 4-bit representation).
- XOR of 1, 2, and 3 is 0.
- XOR of 1, 2, and 4 is 7 (which is 3 in 4-bit representation).
- XOR of 1, 3, and 4 is 6 (which is 2 in 4-bit representation).
- XOR of 2, 3, and 4 is 5 (which is 1 in 4-bit representation).
- XOR of all four numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) is 4.

The key insight is that Bob wins when the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. This happens when:
- All numbers can be paired such that each pair XORs to zero.
- The remaining numbers are exactly three 1s, three 3s, and no 2s or 4s (since 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 0).

### Solution Analysis:
The provided program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by:
1. Counting pairs of each number (`a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`).
2. Checking if there are exactly three odd counts among the numbers (`int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`).

Let's verify the logic:
- For each type of number, the number of pairs is `count // 2`, which directly contributes to Bob's wins.
- The additional check `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` ensures that if there are exactly three odd counts among 1s, 2s, and 3s, Bob can win one more time. This is because the presence of an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s can be balanced by removing one of each, leaving the XOR of the remaining numbers as zero.

### Testing the Solution:
Let's test the solution with the provided examples:
1. **Input:** `1 1 1 0`
   - Pairs: `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`
   - Odd counts: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` → `1` (Bob wins once)
   - **Output:** `1`
   
2. **Input:** `1 0 1 2`
   - Pairs: `0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - Odd counts: `1 + 0 + 1 = 2` → `0` (No additional win)
   - **Output:** `1`
   
3. **Input:** `2 2 2 0`
   - Pairs: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
   - Odd counts: `0 + 0 + 0 = 0` → `0` (No additional win)
   - **Output:** `3`
   
4. **Input:** `3 3 2 0`
   - Pairs: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
   - Odd counts: `1 + 1 + 0 = 2` → `0` (No additional win)
   - **Output:** `3`
   
5. **Input:** `0 9 9 9`
   - Pairs: `0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 12`
   - Odd counts: `0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3` → `1` (Bob wins once more)
   - **Output:** `12`

The output matches the expected results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

**Correctness: True**
