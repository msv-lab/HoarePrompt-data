Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description step-by-step.

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is zero. The key observation here is that the XOR of all numbers is zero if and only if the count of each number with odd parity (1, 3) is even, and the count of each number with even parity (2, 4) is irrelevant to the XOR being zero.

The given program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win using the formula:
\[ \text{Bob wins} = \left(\frac{a}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{b}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{c}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{d}{2}\right) + \left(\text{int}(a \% 2 + b \% 2 + c \% 2 == 3)\right) \]

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Divide each count by 2**: This part ensures that if there are an even number of ones, threes, twos, and fours, then they can be paired up, and Bob can win in those pairs.
2. **Check for three odd counts**: If there are three odd counts among \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (ignoring \(d\) because it's even), then Bob can win one additional time by leaving the remaining odd number (which will be 1 or 3) and making the XOR zero.

Let's verify this with the provided examples:

1. **Input**: `1 1 1 0`
   - Calculation: \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{0}{2} + \text{int}(1 \% 2 + 1 \% 2 + 1 \% 2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Input**: `1 0 1 2`
   - Calculation: \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{0}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{2} + \text{int}(1 \% 2 + 0 \% 2 + 1 \% 2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 \)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Input**: `2 2 2 0`
   - Calculation: \( \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{2} + \frac{0}{2} + \text{int}(2 \% 2 + 2 \% 2 + 2 \% 2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3 \)
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

4. **Input**: `3 3 2 0`
   - Calculation: \( \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{2}{2} + \frac{0}{2} + \text{int}(3 \% 2 + 3 \% 2 + 2 \% 2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3 \)
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

5. **Input**: `0 9 9 9`
   - Calculation: \( \frac{0}{2} + \frac{9}{2} + \frac{9}{2} + \frac{9}{2} + \text{int}(0 \% 2 + 9 \% 2 + 9 \% 2 == 3) = 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 12 \)
   - Output: `12` (Correct)

After analyzing the provided examples and the logic, it appears that the program correctly determines the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that seem to be missed by this logic. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
