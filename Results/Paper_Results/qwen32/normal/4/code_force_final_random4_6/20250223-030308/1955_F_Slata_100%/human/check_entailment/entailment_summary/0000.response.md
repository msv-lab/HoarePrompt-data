### Reasoning:

To determine if the program is correct, we need to analyze whether the given formula accurately computes the maximum number of times Bob can win, given the optimal strategy for Eve.

The winning condition for Bob is when the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers in the sequence is zero. To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible.

Let's break down the formula used in the program:
- `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`: This part of the formula counts the number of pairs of each type of number (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s). Each pair of identical numbers will cancel each other out in terms of XOR (since `x ^ x = 0`).
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`: This part checks if there is exactly one of each type of number left (1, 2, and 3) after all pairs are removed. If so, the XOR of these three numbers will be zero if they are 1, 2, and 3 (since `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0`).

This strategy ensures that Eve removes numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible, thereby maximizing Bob's wins.

Let's verify this with the given examples:

1. **First Example:**
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Calculation: `1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + int(1 + 1 + 1 == 3)` = `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1` = `1`
   - Bob wins once when no numbers are removed.

2. **Second Example:**
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Calculation: `1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 2 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + int(1 + 0 + 1 == 3)` = `0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1` = `2`
   - However, the correct answer is `1`. This indicates a discrepancy, and we need to re-evaluate the logic.

Upon closer inspection, the formula `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` does not correctly account for all scenarios. Specifically, it does not handle cases where there are multiple ways to form a zero XOR with the remaining numbers optimally.

### Conclusion:
The given formula does not correctly compute the maximum number of times Bob can win in all scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
