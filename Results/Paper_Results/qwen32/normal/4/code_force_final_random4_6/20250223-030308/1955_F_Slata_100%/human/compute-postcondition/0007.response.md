The code snippet provided assigns new integer values to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by reading from the input and splitting it into four parts. The initial state mentioned that `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are new integers obtained from the input, and `i` is `i + 1`. However, the value of `i` is not affected by the provided code snippet, and `t` remains unchanged.

The output state will reflect the new values assigned to `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` based on the input. Since the input values are not specified, we'll denote them as `input_a`, `input_b`, `input_c`, and `input_d` to represent the specific values they hold after the input is processed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is `input_a`; `b` is `input_b`; `c` is `input_c`; `d` is `input_d`; `i` is `i + 1`**
