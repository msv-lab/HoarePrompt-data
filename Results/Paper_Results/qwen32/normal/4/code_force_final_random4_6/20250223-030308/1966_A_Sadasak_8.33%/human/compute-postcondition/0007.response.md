The given code snippet increments the count of `num` in the `frequency_table` dictionary by 1. If `num` was not previously in the dictionary, it initializes the count to 1. The precondition states that if `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, it was set to `k`. However, after the increment, the value of `frequency_table[num]` could potentially exceed `k` again.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `frequency_table[num]` is now `frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1`; if `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, it is now set to `k`; `num` is the next element in `arr`.**

In simpler terms, the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is increased by 1. If this count exceeds `k`, it will be adjusted back to `k`. All other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
