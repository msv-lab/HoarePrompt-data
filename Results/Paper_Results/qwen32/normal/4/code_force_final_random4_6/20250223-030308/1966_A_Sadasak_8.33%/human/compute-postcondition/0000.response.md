The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary named `frequency_table`. This dictionary will be used to store the frequency of each integer in the list `arr` during subsequent operations. The initial state of `arr` and `k` remains unchanged as they are not modified by this line of code. The number of test cases `t`, the length of the list `n`, and the list `arr` itself are also not affected by this line.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number written on a card, and `k` is an integer representing the number of cards to exchange during each operation such that 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 2 <= k <= 100. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) indicates the number of test cases, and each test case is described by two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line contains `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards. `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.**
