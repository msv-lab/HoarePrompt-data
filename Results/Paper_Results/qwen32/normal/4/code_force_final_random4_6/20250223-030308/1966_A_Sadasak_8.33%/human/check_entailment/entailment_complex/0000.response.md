### Reasoning:
The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by calculating the frequency of each card number and then using that frequency to determine the minimum number of cards left. However, there are several logical flaws in the program that make it incorrect.

1. **Frequency Capping**: The function `func_1` capping the frequency of each card number at `k` is not correct. The frequency should be the actual count of each card number, as we need to know the exact number of cards of each value to determine how many operations we can perform.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cards**: The logic in the main loop for determining the minimum number of cards is flawed:
   - `if k > n: print(n)`: This condition is not necessary and does not correctly handle the scenario where `k` is greater than `n`.
   - `elif k == n: print(k - 1)`: This condition is also not correct. If `k == n`, it does not imply the minimum number of cards left is `k - 1`. It depends on the distribution of card numbers.
   - The core logic after the function call is incorrect. The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table, which does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.

3. **Correct Approach**: The correct approach involves:
   - Counting the frequency of each card number.
   - For each unique card number, determine how many operations can be performed (i.e., `freq[num] // k` operations can be performed, each reducing the count by `k-1`).
   - The remaining cards after all possible operations will be the sum of `freq[num] % k` for each unique card number.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations as described in the problem statement.
