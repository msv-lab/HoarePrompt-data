Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations. The function `func_1` is supposed to help in calculating the frequency of each card number, but it doesn't contribute to the correct solution. 

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Logic Error in `func_1`:** The function `func_1` is supposed to return a frequency table where the count of each card is capped at `k`. However, capping the frequency at `k` doesn't help in determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. The correct approach would involve using the frequencies to determine how many groups of `k` cards can be formed and then reducing the count of cards accordingly.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1` Output:** The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table returned by `func_1`. This check is incorrect and doesn't relate to the problem's requirement.

3. **Incorrect Conditions:** The conditions `if k > n:` and `elif k == n:` are not sufficient to determine the minimum number of cards. The logic should consider the frequencies of each card and how they can be reduced by performing the allowed operations.

4. **Lack of Proper Reduction Logic:** The program lacks the logic to properly reduce the number of cards based on the frequencies. It should repeatedly reduce groups of `k` cards to `k-1` cards until no more such groups can be formed.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
