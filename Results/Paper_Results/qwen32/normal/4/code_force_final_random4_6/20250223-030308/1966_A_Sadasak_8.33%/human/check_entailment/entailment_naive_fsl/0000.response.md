Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for all potential cases. Let's analyze why:

1. **Function `func_1` is incorrect**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to count the frequency of each number in the list `arr` and limit it to `k`. However, it doesn't correctly reduce the frequency to `k` if it exceeds `k`. Instead, it simply sets the frequency to `k` if it exceeds `k` which is incorrect. The frequency should be reduced to `k` in each iteration.
   - The function does not return the correct number of cards that can be reduced based on the operations described.

2. **Logic in the main loop is incorrect**:
   - The main logic does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cards after performing the operations. It incorrectly checks if `k` is in the frequency values and then prints `k - 1` which is not the correct approach.
   - The main logic does not handle the reduction of cards properly based on the frequency of each number and the value of `k`.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

**Example:**
```
Input:
1
6 3
10 20 30 10 20 40

Expected Output:
1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- We have 6 cards with numbers [10, 20, 30, 10, 20, 40].
- We can perform the operation on the two 10s and two 20s, reducing the count of each by 3 and adding 2 cards back, resulting in [30, 10, 20, 40, x, x] (where x can be any number).
- We can perform the operation again on the remaining two 10s and two 20s, reducing the count of each by 3 and adding 2 cards back, resulting in [30, 40, x, x, x, x].
- Finally, we can perform the operation on the two 30s and two 40s, reducing the count of each by 3 and adding 2 cards back, resulting in [x, x, x, x, x, x].
- The minimum number of cards left is 1.

**Program Output:**
- The program will not correctly handle this case and will likely output an incorrect result.

Given the issues in the provided program, it is clear that it does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is False.
