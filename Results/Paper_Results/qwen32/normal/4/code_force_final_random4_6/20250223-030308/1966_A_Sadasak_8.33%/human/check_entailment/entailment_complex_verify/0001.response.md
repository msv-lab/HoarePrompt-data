### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code systematically.

#### Problem Recap:
You have a hand of `n` cards, and you can perform an operation where you exchange any `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards of any number. The goal is to determine the minimum number of cards you can have after performing any number of such operations.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Special Cases**:
   - If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, so the result is `n`.
   - If `k == n`, you can perform one operation and end up with `k-1` cards.

2. **General Case**:
   - For each unique card number, determine how many times it appears and compute the remainder when this count is divided by `k`. The remainder represents the number of cards that cannot be exchanged away because they don't form a complete set of `k` cards.
   - Sum these remainders to get the minimum number of cards left. If the sum is zero, it means all cards can be exchanged down to `k-1` cards, provided there was at least one number that appeared `k` times.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.

2. **Special Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the cases where `k > n` and `k == n`.

3. **General Case**:
   - The function `func_1` creates a frequency table and truncates the frequency to `k` if it exceeds `k`. This truncation is incorrect because it does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left.
   - The main logic checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k-1` if true, otherwise, it prints `n`. This logic is incorrect and does not account for the optimal way to reduce the number of cards.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function is intended to create a frequency table but incorrectly truncates the frequency to `k`. This truncation does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.

#### Correct Approach:
- For each unique card number, compute the remainder when the count is divided by `k`.
- Sum these remainders. If the sum is zero, the result should be `k-1` (if it's possible to perform operations to reach this state), otherwise, it should be the sum of the remainders.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for determining the minimum number of cards left is flawed, and the truncation in `func_1` does not help in achieving the correct result.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
