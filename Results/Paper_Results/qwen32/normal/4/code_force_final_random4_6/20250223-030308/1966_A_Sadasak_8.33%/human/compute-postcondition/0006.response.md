The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. If `arr` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the last element processed from `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least one more element, and `num` should be the next element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements. If `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, it is now set to `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` retains its original value. `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
