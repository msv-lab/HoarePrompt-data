The code snippet updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by incrementing the count of the current `num` by 1. If `num` was not already a key in `frequency_table`, it is added with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `frequency_table[num]` is now `k + 1` if it was `k` before, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` is 1; `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
