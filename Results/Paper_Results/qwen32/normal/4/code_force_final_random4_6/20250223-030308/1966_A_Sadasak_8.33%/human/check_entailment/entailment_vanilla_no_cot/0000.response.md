Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the frequency of each card number, but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This is not the correct approach for solving the problem. The frequency of each card should be counted without any caps.

2. The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the operations. The logic for determining the minimum number of cards is flawed.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Count the frequency of each card number.
- For each unique card number, compute how many cards can be reduced using the given operation.
- The final result for each test case is the total number of cards minus the maximum number of cards that can be reduced.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card number
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in nums:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the maximum number of cards that can be reduced
    max_reducible = 0
    for count in frequency_table.values():
        max_reducible += count - (count % k)
    
    # The minimum number of cards left is n - max_reducible
    min_cards_left = n - max_reducible
    print(min_cards_left)
```

This corrected program will correctly compute the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations as described in the problem statement.
