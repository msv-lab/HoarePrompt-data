The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be increased by 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, and `m` is the third input integer. If `m` is less than either `a` or `b`, then `m` is less than either `a` or `b`. Otherwise, `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`.**
