The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `a`, `b`, and `m` are frequencies and visibility time that will be updated by the input. After the execution, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` will be the integers provided by the input, while `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer.**
