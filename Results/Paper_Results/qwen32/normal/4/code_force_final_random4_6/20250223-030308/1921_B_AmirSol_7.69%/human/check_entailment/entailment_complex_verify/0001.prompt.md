You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    print(func_1(n, s1, s2))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0's and '1's.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    counter = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:

            else:
                counter += 1
                i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is `n` and `counter` is the number of times `s1[i]` was not equal to `s2[i]` under the specified conditions.
    return counter
    #The program returns the number of times `s1[i]` was not equal to `s2[i]` under the specified conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2`, each of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. It returns the number of positions `i` where `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, considering specific conditions for consecutive mismatches.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The goal is to transform the initial state `s1` into the final state `s2` using the minimum number of operations, where operations are defined as adding, removing, or moving a cat from one box to another.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the minimum number of operations. It iterates through the boxes and counts the number of mismatches between `s1` and `s2`. If a mismatch is found, it considers the following:
- If there is another mismatch in the next box and the states of the current and next boxes are different, it treats these two mismatches as a single operation (moving a cat from one box to another).
- Otherwise, it treats the mismatch as a single operation (either adding or removing a cat).

However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for all possible scenarios. Specifically:
- It does not handle cases where the mismatches are not adjacent.
- It does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple cats need to be moved or added/removed in a way that is more efficient than the approach taken by the program.

Let's consider an example to demonstrate the flaw:
- Suppose `s1 = "10010"` and `s2 = "00001"`. The program would count 2 operations, but the correct answer is 2 as well (move the cat from the first box to the last, then remove the cat from the fourth box). This example works, but let's consider another one.
- Suppose `s1 = "11000"` and `s2 = "00110"`. The program would count 3 operations, but the correct answer is 2 (move the cat from the first box to the third, and move the cat from the second box to the fourth).

The correct approach would involve counting the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2` that are not in the same position. The minimum number of operations required would be the sum of the absolute differences in the counts of '1's in the two states.

Here is the corrected logic:
1. Count the number of '1's in `s1` that are not in the same position as '1's in `s2`.
2. Count the number of '1's in `s2` that are not in the same position as '1's in `s1`.
3. The minimum number of operations is the sum of these two counts.

The provided program does not correctly implement this logic, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
