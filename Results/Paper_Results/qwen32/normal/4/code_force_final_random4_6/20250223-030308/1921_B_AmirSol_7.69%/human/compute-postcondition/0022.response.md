The `while` loop condition is `i < n`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the variable `i` must be less than `n`. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `i` is an integer that has been updated based on the conditions provided.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` such that it is less than `n`. Since the exact value of `i` after the previous iteration is not provided, we can only specify that `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` is less than `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `i` must be less than `n`**
