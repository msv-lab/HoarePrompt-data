### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` into the desired state `s2`. The function attempts to count the number of mismatches and apply a specific logic to handle consecutive mismatches, but it fails to consider the optimal sequence of operations needed to achieve the desired state.

Let's analyze the function `func_1` and the counterexamples provided:

1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function iterates through each position `i` in the strings `s1` and `s2`.
   - If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, it checks the next position `i+1`:
     - If `s1[i+1]` is not equal to `s2[i+1]` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i+1]`, it increments the counter by 1 and skips to position `i+2` (assuming a swap operation).
     - Otherwise, it increments the counter by 1 and moves to the next position `i+1` (assuming an add/remove operation).
   - If `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, it simply moves to the next position `i+1`.

2. **Counterexample Analysis**:
   - **Test Case 1**:
     ```
     3
     010
     101
     ```
     - The initial state is `010` and the desired state is `101`.
     - The function `func_1` would count the mismatches at positions 0 and 2, and might count the mismatch at position 1 as well, leading to an incorrect count.
     - The correct minimal operations are:
       1. Move the cat from box 2 to box 1 (state becomes `110`).
       2. Move the cat from box 2 to box 3 (state becomes `101`).
     - This requires 2 operations, but the function might count more due to its logic.

   - **Test Case 2**:
     ```
     4
     0101
     1010
     ```
     - The initial state is `0101` and the desired state is `1010`.
     - The function `func_1` might count the mismatches at positions 0, 1, 2, and 3, leading to an incorrect count.
     - The correct minimal operations are:
       1. Swap cats in boxes 2 and 3 (state becomes `0110`).
       2. Swap cats in boxes 1 and 2 (state becomes `1010`).
     - This requires 2 operations, but the function might count 4 operations.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the optimal sequence of operations needed to transform `s1` into `s2`. It fails to account for the possibility of swapping cats between boxes, which can reduce the number of operations required.
   - The original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final: **False**
