The code increments the value of `counter` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and constraints. The output state reflects this change in `counter`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 1, `i` is 0, `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, `i < n - 1`, `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]`, and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`.**
