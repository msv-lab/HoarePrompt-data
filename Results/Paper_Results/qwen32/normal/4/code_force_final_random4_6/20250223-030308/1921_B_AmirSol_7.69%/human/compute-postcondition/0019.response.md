Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. If `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`, then `i` is updated to `i + 2` and `counter` is either 1 or 2 based on the conditions mentioned. Otherwise, `i` is either 2 or 3 with specific conditions on the characters around `i` if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`. Otherwise, `i` is 2 with `s1[i]` equal to `s2[i]`, and `counter` is either 1 or 2 based on the conditions mentioned.**
