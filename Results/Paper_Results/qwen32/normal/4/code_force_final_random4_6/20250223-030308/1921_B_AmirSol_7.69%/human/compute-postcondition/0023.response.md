Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `i` must be less than `n`, `counter` is increased by 1.**

In simpler terms: The value of `counter` has been incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, with `n` still being an integer between 2 and 100,000, and `i` still being less than `n`.
