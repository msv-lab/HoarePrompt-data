Postcondition: **`s` is the new input string that must contain at least one character, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each character in `s` with at least one character having a count greater than zero. If the current character `i` in `hmp` has a count less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
