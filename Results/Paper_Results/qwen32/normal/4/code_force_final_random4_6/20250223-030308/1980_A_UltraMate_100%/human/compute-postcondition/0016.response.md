Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the string from the input, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each character in `s`, `i` is `'F'`. If `i` (which is `'F'`) is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is its previous value plus `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
