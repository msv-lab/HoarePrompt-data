The code snippet `xylist = input().split(' ')` reads a new input string and splits it into a list of substrings based on spaces. This means that the existing `xylist` is overwritten with the new input values. The variables `t`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input string representing the number of test cases, `x` is a list containing two identical integer values of `xylist[0]`, `y` is a list containing two identical integer values of `xylist[1]`, `xylist` is a new list of substrings from the new input split by spaces, `i` is 5.**
