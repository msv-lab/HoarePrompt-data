Postcondition: **`t` is an input string representing the number of test cases, `x` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[0]` from ten different inputs, `y` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[1]` from ten different inputs, and `i` is 0. If `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, then `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`. Otherwise, `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`.**
