Reasoning:  
The provided Python program is designed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers, and then output the minimum and maximum of each pair. However, there are a few issues with the code that need to be addressed to ensure it works correctly based on the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The number of test cases `t` is read from the input, but it is not used in the subsequent loop. Instead, the loop is hardcoded to iterate 10 times, which does not align with the problem statement that specifies the number of test cases can be between 1 and 100.

2. **Output Formatting**: The code correctly prints the minimum and maximum of each pair, but the problem description specifies that there should be no extra spaces between the numbers in the output.

3. **Loop Correction**: The loop should iterate `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases, not a fixed 10 times.

Given these points, the program as written does not correctly handle the number of test cases and includes unnecessary spaces in the output. However, based on the provided execution summary, it appears that the program was tested with exactly 10 test cases, and the output format matched the expected output for those specific cases. Therefore, if the problem constraints are strictly adhered to (i.e., the number of test cases is always 10), the program would work correctly for those specific cases.

However, to be strictly correct according to the problem description, the program should be modified to handle any number of test cases between 1 and 100 and should not include unnecessary spaces in the output.

Correctness: **False** (if strict adherence to the problem description is required)
