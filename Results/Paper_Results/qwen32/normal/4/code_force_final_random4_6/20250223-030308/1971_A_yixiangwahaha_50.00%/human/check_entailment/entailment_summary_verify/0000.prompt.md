You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads ten pairs of integers, each pair consisting of two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9). For each pair, it prints the smaller integer followed by the larger integer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it assumes there are always 10 test cases, regardless of the input value `t`. The problem description clearly states that the number of test cases `t` can be between 1 and 100 inclusive. Therefore, the program should read `t` and iterate `t` times instead of always iterating 10 times.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  3 5
  ```
- Actual Output:
  The program would wait for 9 more inputs and then output:
  ```
  5 3
  ```

To fix the program, the loop should iterate `t` times instead of always 10 times. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x = int(xylist[0])
        y = int(xylist[1])
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)

func()
```
