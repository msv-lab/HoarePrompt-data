Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `t` is an input string representing the number of test cases.
- `x` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[0]` from ten different inputs.
- `y` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[1]` from ten different inputs.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
```

Since `i` is 0, the statement will print the first element of the `y` list followed by a space and the first element of the `x` list.

Therefore, the output will be the first element of `y` followed by a space and the first element of `x`.

Output: **y[0] x[0] (where y[0] is the first element of the y list and x[0] is the first element of the x list)**
