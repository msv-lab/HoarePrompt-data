To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an input string representing the number of test cases.
- `x` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[0]` from ten different inputs.
- `y` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[1]` from ten different inputs.
- `i` is set to 1.
- The condition `if x[i] is less than y[i]` determines the relationship between `x[i]` and `y[i]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**: The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1.
2. **Values of `x[i]` and `y[i]`**: 
   - `x[i]` refers to the second element of the list `x` (since list indices start from 0).
   - `y[i]` refers to the second element of the list `y`.

Since the exact values of `x[1]` and `y[1]` are not provided in the initial state, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

### Output Determination:
The `print` statement will output the second elements of the lists `x` and `y`, separated by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **x[1]  y[1]** (where `x[1]` is the second element of the list `x` and `y[1]` is the second element of the list `y`)
