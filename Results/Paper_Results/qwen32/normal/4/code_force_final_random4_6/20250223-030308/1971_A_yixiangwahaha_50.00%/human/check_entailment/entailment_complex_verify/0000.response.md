Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed assumes there are always 10 test cases, regardless of the input value `t`. The problem description clearly specifies that the number of test cases `t` can range from 1 to 100. Therefore, the program should dynamically handle the number of test cases based on the input value `t` rather than always iterating 10 times.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program reads exactly 10 pairs of integers and processes them. This behavior is inconsistent with the problem requirements, which allow for a variable number of test cases. The example given in the original assessment demonstrates a scenario where the program's behavior deviates from the expected output due to its fixed iteration count.

The suggested corrected version of the program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates `t` times, processing each pair of integers as required.

Final: **False**
