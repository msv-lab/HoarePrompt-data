You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads ten pairs of integers, each pair consisting of two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9). For each pair, it prints the smaller integer followed by the larger integer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, but it assumes there are always exactly 10 test cases. This is incorrect as the problem statement specifies that the number of test cases, `t`, can be between 1 and 100.
2. The program reads the number of test cases `t` but does not use it. Instead, it hardcoded the loop to run 10 times, which is not flexible and does not adhere to the problem description.
3. The program correctly reads each pair of integers `x` and `y` for each test case and stores them in separate lists `x` and `y`.
4. It then correctly iterates over these lists and prints the minimum and maximum of each pair in the required format.
5. However, due to the hardcoded loop, the program will fail if the number of test cases is not 10, which is a violation of the problem statement.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the variable number of test cases as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
