Given the initial state, we have:
- `t` is an input string representing the number of test cases.
- `x` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[0]` from ten different inputs.
- `y` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[1]` from ten different inputs.
- `i` is set to 2.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 2.
- `x` and `y` are lists of ten integers each.

The specific values of `x[2]` and `y[2]` are not explicitly provided, but we know they are the third elements (since list indexing starts at 0) of the `x` and `y` lists respectively.

Thus, the output will be the third elements of the `x` and `y` lists, separated by a space.

Output: **x[2] y[2] (where x[2] is the third element of the x list and y[2] is the third element of the y list)**
