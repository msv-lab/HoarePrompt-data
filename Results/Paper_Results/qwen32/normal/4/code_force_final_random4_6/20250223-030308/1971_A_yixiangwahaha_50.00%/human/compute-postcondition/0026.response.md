The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input string representing the number of test cases, `x` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[0]` from ten different inputs, `y` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[1]` from ten different inputs, and `i` is 2.**
