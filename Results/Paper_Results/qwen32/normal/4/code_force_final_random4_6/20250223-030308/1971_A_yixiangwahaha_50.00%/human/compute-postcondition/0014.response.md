The code appends the integer value of `xylist[1]` to the list `y`. Initially, `y` contains two identical integer values of `xylist[1]`. After the append operation, `y` will contain three identical integer values of `xylist[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input string representing the number of test cases, `x` is a list containing three identical integer values of `xylist[0]`, `y` is a list containing three identical integer values of `xylist[1]`, `xylist` is a new list of substrings from the new input split by spaces, `i` is 5.**
