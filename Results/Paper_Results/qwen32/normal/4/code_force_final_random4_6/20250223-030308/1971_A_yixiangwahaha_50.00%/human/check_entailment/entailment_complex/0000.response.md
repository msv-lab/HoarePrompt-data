Reasoning: 

The provided program is incorrect based on the problem description. The program is designed to handle exactly 10 test cases, regardless of the value of `t` provided as input. This is evident from the loop that runs exactly 10 times for reading inputs and another loop that runs exactly 10 times for processing and printing outputs. 

However, according to the problem statement, the number of test cases `t` can vary from 1 to 100. Therefore, the program should be flexible to handle any number of test cases within this range, not just 10.

For example, if the input is `1`, the program should only process one test case, but it will attempt to read and process 10 test cases, leading to incorrect behavior or runtime errors due to insufficient input.

To correct this, the loops should iterate `t` times instead of a fixed 10 times.

Correctness: **False**
