Reasoning: The provided code does not solve the problem as described. The task is to determine the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order because the largest differences will be between the smallest and largest numbers. However, the given code sorts the array and prints it, which does not compute or output the beauty of the array. The code should calculate the beauty after sorting the array in the optimal order (either ascending or descending).

Correctness: **False**
