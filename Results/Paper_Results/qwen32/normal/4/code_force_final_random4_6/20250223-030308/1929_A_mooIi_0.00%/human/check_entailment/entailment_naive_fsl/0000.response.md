Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array after rearranging its elements. The beauty is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

However, the current implementation sorts the array and prints the sorted array elements, which is not what the problem requires. The program should calculate and print the maximum beauty for each test case, not the sorted array itself.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

# Example usage
# func()
```

In this corrected version, the program sorts the array, calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, and then prints the beauty for each test case.
