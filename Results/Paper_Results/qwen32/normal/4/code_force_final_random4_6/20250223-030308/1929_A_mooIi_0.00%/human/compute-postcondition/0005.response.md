The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new value to the variable `n` by taking an integer input from the user. The variables `t` and `ar` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `n` while keeping `t` and `ar` as they were initially.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is the integer input by the user, `ar` is a map object containing the sorted string representations of integers from the input**.
