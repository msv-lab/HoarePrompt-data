The code provided takes the input, converts it to a list of integers, sorts these integers, converts them back to strings, and then maps them to `ar`. Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is the new integer input by the user. The variable `ar` is updated to hold the map object of the sorted string representations of the integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is the new integer input by the user, `ar` is a map object containing the sorted string representations of integers from the input.**

In simpler terms, `t` stays the same, `n` gets the new integer input, and `ar` now contains the sorted string representations of the integers from the input.
