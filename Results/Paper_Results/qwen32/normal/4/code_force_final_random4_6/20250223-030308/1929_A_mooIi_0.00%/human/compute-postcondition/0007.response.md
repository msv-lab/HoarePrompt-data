To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This variable represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it does not directly impact the output of the given `print` statement.
2. **`n`**: The integer input by the user. This represents the number of elements in the list `ar`.
3. **`ar`**: A map object containing the sorted string representations of integers from the input. This means that `ar` is a map object that will have string representations of integers, and these strings are sorted.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(ar))
```

### Explanation:
- **`ar`**: Since `ar` is a map object containing the sorted string representations of integers, it will hold string values that are sorted in ascending order.
- **`' '.join(ar)`**: This expression joins all the elements in the map object `ar` into a single string, with each element separated by a space.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Input Collection**: Assume the user inputs a list of integers. For example, if the user inputs the integers `3`, `1`, and `2`, these integers will be converted to their string representations: `"3"`, `"1"`, and `"2"`.
2. **Sorting**: The map object `ar` will contain these string representations sorted in ascending order: `["1", "2", "3"]`.
3. **Joining**: The `join` function concatenates these sorted string representations into a single string with spaces in between, resulting in `"1 2 3"`.

### Final Output:
Given the above steps, the `print` statement will output the sorted string representations of the integers from the input, joined by spaces.

### Output:
Output: **sorted_string_representations_of_integers_joined_by_spaces (where sorted_string_representations_of_integers is the sorted list of string representations of the integers input by the user)**

For a concrete example, if the user inputs `3 1 2`, the output will be:
Output: **1 2 3**
