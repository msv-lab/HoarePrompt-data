The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will iterate based on the value returned by `int(input())`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that `int(input())` will receive, which should be an integer representing the number of test cases, `t`.

Given that `t` is already defined in the state before the loop starts as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 500`, we need to ensure that the input function will return this value `t`. Since `t` is already provided and within the required range, no adjustment to `t` is necessary in terms of its value. However, we need to make sure that the input function will return `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and `int(input())` returns `t`**

This state ensures that the loop will execute `t` times, as required.
