The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the condition `removals + 1`. If `i` is less than `removals + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again.

Let's break down the state adjustments:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2` (since `i` was incremented to `i + 1` at the end of the last iteration and we need to increment it again for the next iteration).
- The other variables (`removals`, `s`, `n`, `pos`) are not in the loop head, so they should remain as they are.

State: **`removals` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `s` is `s - elements[-(i + 1)]`, `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + (i + 1))] - elements[-(i + 1)]` if indices are within bounds, otherwise `n` is 0, `pos` includes the new value `s - 2 * n`**.

However, since we can only adjust the variables in the loop head, we only adjust `i`:
State: **`removals` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 2`**.
