Output State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is `s - elements[-i]`, `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to include the difference between `elements[-(negatives + i)]` and `elements[-i]`. The values of `removals`, `i`, and `s` remain as per their initial state descriptions.
