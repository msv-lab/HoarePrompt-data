Output State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing two elements `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements` minus `elements[-i]`. If `negatives + i` is within the bounds of `elements`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)]` minus `elements[-i]`. If `negatives + i` is out of bounds, `n` is 0.**

In simple terms, the `pos` list now contains two identical elements, each calculated as `s - 2 * n`. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
