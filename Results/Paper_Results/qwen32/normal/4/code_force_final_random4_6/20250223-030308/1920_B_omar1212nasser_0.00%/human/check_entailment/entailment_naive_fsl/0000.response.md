Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic for the problem description. The function `func_2` contains a hardcoded condition that only returns `0` when `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`. This is clearly not a general solution to the problem and does not work for all possible inputs.

Let's analyze a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 1 1
3 1 2 4
```
According to the problem description:
1. Alice can remove at most 1 element.
2. Bob can multiply at most 1 element by -1.

The optimal strategy for Alice is to remove the largest element, which is `4`. The array becomes `[3, 1, 2]`.
The optimal strategy for Bob is to multiply the smallest element by -1, which is `1`. The array becomes `[3, -1, 2]`.

The sum of the array is `3 + (-1) + 2 = 4`.

However, the provided code does not handle this case correctly. The hardcoded condition in `func_2` does not apply to this case, and the logic for calculating the sum is flawed. The code does not correctly simulate the optimal moves for both Alice and Bob in a general manner.

Thus, the code is incorrect, and the Correctness is False.
