The code snippet only initializes an empty list `pos`. This means that the variables `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`removals` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, `elements` is a list of integers representing the array, and `pos` is an empty list.**
