Functionality: **The function takes three parameters: `removals` (a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove), `negatives` (a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1), and `elements` (a list of integers). If `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the maximum value from a list of potential sums, where each sum is derived by considering different combinations of removing elements from the end of the list and negating elements from the end of the list.**
