The code snippet appends the value `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos`. Here, `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `elements`, and `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`.

Given the initial state, the variables `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, `s`, and `n` are defined. The value of `s` and `n` are derived from the `elements` list. The list `pos` is initially empty.

After the code executes, the list `pos` will contain one additional element, which is `s - 2 * n`.

Output State: **`removals` is a non-negative integer, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing one element `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`.**
