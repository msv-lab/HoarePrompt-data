Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `removals` is a non-negative integer, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing one element `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, removals + 1):
    s -= elements[-i]
    try:
        n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]
    except IndexError:
        n = 0
    pos.append(s - 2 * n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing two elements `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements` minus `elements[-i]`. If `negatives + i` is within the bounds of `elements`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)]` minus `elements[-i]`. If `negatives + i` is out of bounds, `n` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `removals` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is `s - elements[-i]`, `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if indices are within bounds, otherwise `n` is 0, `pos` includes the new value `s - 2 * n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `removals` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `s` is decreased by `elements[-i]`, `n` is incremented by `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if no `IndexError` occurs, otherwise `n` is 0, `pos` has an additional element `s - 2 * n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
