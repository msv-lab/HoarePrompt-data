Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. The logic in the program seems to be trying to find the smallest contiguous subarray of identical elements, but this approach does not solve the problem as described.

The program should find the smallest segment that, when removed, makes the array not beautiful. This involves checking more complex conditions than just finding the smallest contiguous subarray of identical elements. For example, in the case where the array is composed of alternating segments of different lengths, simply removing the shortest segment may not be enough to make the array not beautiful.

Here's a brief explanation of why the current logic is insufficient:

- The program calculates `minn` as the length of the shortest contiguous segment of identical elements.
- If `minn` is the length of the entire array, it outputs `-1` (correctly), as no elements can be removed to make the array not beautiful.
- However, if `minn` is less than the length of the array, it outputs `minn` as the answer. This is incorrect because removing just the shortest contiguous segment of identical elements may not be sufficient to make the array not beautiful. The correct approach would involve checking how removing different segments affects the ability to perform the described operation until all elements are the same.

To solve the problem correctly, one might need to use a more sophisticated approach, such as segment tree or dynamic programming, to efficiently determine the minimum number of elements to remove.
