To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables evolve as the loop progresses through the list `ar`.

The loop iterates through the list `ar` starting from index 1. The variable `same` keeps track of the number of consecutive elements in `ar` that are equal to `num`. If a different element is encountered, `same` is reset to 1, `num` is updated to the new element, and `minn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `same`.

The loop continues until `i` reaches the length of the list `ar`. Let's analyze the final state of the variables:

1. **`i`**: After the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar` because the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` is no longer less than `len(ar)`.

2. **`same`**: This will be the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal. If the last sequence has only one element, `same` will be 1. If the last sequence has more than one element, `same` will be the count of those elements.

3. **`num`**: This will be the value of the last element in the list `ar` or the value of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal.

4. **`minn`**: This will be the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements that are equal encountered during the loop.

Given these understandings, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `ar` remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it.
- `i` will be equal to the length of `ar`.
- `same` will be the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal.
- `num` will be the value of the last element in the list `ar` or the value of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal.
- `minn` will be the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements that are equal encountered during the loop.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers; `i` is equal to the length of `ar`; `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal; `num` is the value of the last element in the list `ar` or the value of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal; `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements that are equal encountered during the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `i` will be the length of the list `ar`, `same` will reflect the count of the final sequence of identical elements, `num` will be the value of the last element in the sequence, and `minn` will be the smallest count of any sequence of identical elements encountered.
