The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `same`. Other variables such as `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, and `minn` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 3; `i` is increased by 1, and `i` is still less than `len(ar)`; `num` is `ar[i]`; `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`; `same` is 1.**
