The variable `num` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `ar`. The other variables, `t`, `ar`, `n`, `i`, `minn`, and `same`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` read from the input; `n` is the length of the new `ar` list; `i`, `minn` are undefined or recalculated based on the new `ar` list; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`.**
