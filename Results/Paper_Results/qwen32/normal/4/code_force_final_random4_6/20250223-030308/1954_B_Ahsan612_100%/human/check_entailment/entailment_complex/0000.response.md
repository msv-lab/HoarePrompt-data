Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. The program iterates through each test case, identifies the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive equal elements in the array, and determines whether the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, the program initializes variables to keep track of the current sequence length (`same`), the most recent number in the sequence (`num`), and the minimum sequence length found so far (`minn`).

2. **Iteration through the array**: The program iterates through the array to find sequences of consecutive equal elements. When a sequence ends (i.e., the current element differs from the previous one), it updates `minn` with the length of the sequence if it's smaller than the current `minn`. It also resets the sequence length counter (`same`) and updates the current number (`num`).

3. **Final check**: After the loop, the program performs a final check to update `minn` with the length of the last sequence. If `minn` is still `inf` or equal to the length of the array, it means all elements were the same (or there was only one element), and the program prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which represents the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive equal elements.

The logic of the program is sound and correctly identifies the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful, or determines that it is impossible to do so.

Correctness: **True**
