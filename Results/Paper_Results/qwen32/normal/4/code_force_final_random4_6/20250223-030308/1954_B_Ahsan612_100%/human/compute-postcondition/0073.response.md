To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes the list `ar`. The loop iterates through the list, counting consecutive occurrences of each number and updating the minimum count of consecutive occurrences (`minn`) when a new number is encountered.

From the given states after the first three iterations, we can infer the pattern:
1. After the first iteration, `i` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether `ar[1]` is equal to `ar[0]`.
2. After the second iteration, `i` is either 3 or 5, again depending on whether `ar[2]` is equal to `ar[1]`.
3. After the third iteration, `i` is either 4 or 7, depending on whether `ar[3]` is equal to `ar[2]`.

The loop continues until `i` reaches the length of the list `ar`. At that point, the final values of `same`, `num`, and `minn` will be determined based on the last sequence of consecutive numbers in the list.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `i` will be equal to `len(ar)` (the length of the list).
- `num` will be the last number in the list `ar`.
- `same` will be the count of consecutive occurrences of the last number in the list.
- `minn` will be the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list.

The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

The final output state can be described as follows:
- `i` will be `n` (the length of the list `ar`).
- `num` will be `ar[n-1]` (the last element of the list).
- `same` will be the count of consecutive occurrences of `ar[n-1]` at the end of the list.
- `minn` will be the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]`; `i` is `n`; `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `ar[n-1]` at the end of the list; `num` is `ar[n-1]`; `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list.**

In natural language, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar`, `num` will be the last element of the list, `same` will be the number of times the last element consecutively appears at the end of the list, and `minn` will be the smallest number of times any single number consecutively appears in the list.
