The value of `minn` is set to `inf` by the provided code snippet. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]`; `i` is equal to the length of `ar`; `same` is 1; `num` is `a1`; `minn` is `inf`.**
