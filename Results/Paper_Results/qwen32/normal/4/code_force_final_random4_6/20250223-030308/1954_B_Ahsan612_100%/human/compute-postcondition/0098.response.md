Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than 1; `n` must be greater than `i`; `i` is either 2 or 3; if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3; otherwise, `i` is 2, `same` is 2, `minn` is 1, and `num` is `ar[2]`.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1. If `same` was 2, it becomes 3; if `same` was 1, it becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
