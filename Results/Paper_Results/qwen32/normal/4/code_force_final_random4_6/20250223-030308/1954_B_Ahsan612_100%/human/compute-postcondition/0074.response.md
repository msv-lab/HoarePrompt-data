The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. This means that `minn` will either retain its original value if `same` is greater, or it will be updated to the value of `same` if `same` is smaller.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `minn`. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `same`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]`; `i` is `n`; `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `ar[n-1]` at the end of the list; `num` is `ar[n-1]`; `minn` is the minimum of its original value and `same`.**
