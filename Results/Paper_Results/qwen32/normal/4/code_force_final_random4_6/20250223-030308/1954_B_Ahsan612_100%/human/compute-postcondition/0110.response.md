Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than or equal to 6; `n` must be greater than `i`; `i` is either 4, 5, or 6; `num` is `ar[i]`; `same` is 1; `minn` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is explicitly set to 1, while all other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
