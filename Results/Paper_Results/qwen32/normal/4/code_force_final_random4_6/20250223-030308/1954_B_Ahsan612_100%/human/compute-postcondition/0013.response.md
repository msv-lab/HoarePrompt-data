The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given that `minn` is initially `inf` and `same` is `1`, the minimum of these two values will be `1`.

Therefore, the value of `minn` changes from `inf` to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 1; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[i]`; `minn` is 1; `i` is 2; `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**
