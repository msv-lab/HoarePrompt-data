The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than 1; `n` is the length of the new `ar` list; `i` is 2; `minn` is `inf`; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`; `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.
