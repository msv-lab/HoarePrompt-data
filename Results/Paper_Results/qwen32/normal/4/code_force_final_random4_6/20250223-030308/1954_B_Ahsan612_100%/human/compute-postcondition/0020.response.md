Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 3; `i` is 4; `num` is `ar[4]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `num` is now set to the element at index 4 of the list `ar`. All other variables retain their initial values.
