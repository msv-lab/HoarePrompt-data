Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than or equal to 6; `n` must be greater than `i`; `i` is either 3, 4, or 5; `num` is `ar[i]` if `i` is 3 or 4, otherwise `ar[2]`; `same` is 4 if `ar[i]` was equal to `num` initially, otherwise `same` is 2; `minn` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, so if it was initially 3, it is now 4, and if it was initially 1, it is now 2. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
