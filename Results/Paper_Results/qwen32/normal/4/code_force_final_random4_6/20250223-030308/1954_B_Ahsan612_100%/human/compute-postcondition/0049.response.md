Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`; `i` is 1; `same` is 2; `num` is `a1`; `minn` is `inf`; the current element `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Natural Language: The variable `same` has been incremented by 1, so its value is now 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
