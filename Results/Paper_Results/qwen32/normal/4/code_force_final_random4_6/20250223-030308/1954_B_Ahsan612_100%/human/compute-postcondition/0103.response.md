Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than 1; `n` must be greater than `i`; `i` is either 2, 3, or 4; `num` is `ar[i]` if `i` is 3 or 4, otherwise `ar[2]`; `same` is 3 if `ar[i]` was equal to `num` initially, otherwise `same` is 1; `minn` is 1.**
