The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 1, so now `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`; `i` is 2; `same` is 1; `num` is `a1`; `minn` is `inf`; `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`**
