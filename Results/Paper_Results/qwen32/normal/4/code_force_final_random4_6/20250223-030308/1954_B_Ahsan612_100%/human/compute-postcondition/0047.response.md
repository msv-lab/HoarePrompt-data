To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `i < len(ar)` is satisfied right before the loop starts. Let's analyze the given state and the loop condition:

- `i` is 1.
- `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]`.

The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`.

Given that `i` is 1, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1 to satisfy the condition `i < len(ar)`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that the length of `ar` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`; `i` is 1; `same` is 1; `num` is `a1`; `minn` is `inf`**.
