The code snippet provided is `cliquess[left + i] = clique`. This line of code assigns the value of `clique` to the element of the list `cliquess` at the index `left + i`.

Given the initial state:
- `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n.
- `clique` is an integer representing the clique number.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`.
- `i` is 2.
- `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 3`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.

The only change made by the code is that it reassigns the value of `cliquess[left + i]` to `clique`. Since `cliquess[left + i]` was already `clique`, the value does not change.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n; `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`; `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`; `i` is 2; `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 3`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.**
