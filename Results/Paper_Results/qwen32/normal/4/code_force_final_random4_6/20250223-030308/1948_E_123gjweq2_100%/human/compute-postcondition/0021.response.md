Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are `left + 1` to `left + mid`, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` are `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` except `arr[left + mid + i]` which is `big_element - i`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`, `i` is incremented by 1.`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `arr[left + mid + i]` is updated to `big_element - i`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged. The loop index `i` is incremented by 1.
