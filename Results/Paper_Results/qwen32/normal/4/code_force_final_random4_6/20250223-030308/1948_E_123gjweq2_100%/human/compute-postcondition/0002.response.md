The code calculates the midpoint between `small_element` and `big_element` and assigns it to `mid`. Given the relationships between `left`, `right`, `small_element`, and `big_element`, we can derive the value of `mid`.

Since `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`, the expression for `mid` becomes:

\[ \text{mid} = \left(\text{right} + 1 - (\text{left} + 1) + 1\right) // 2 \]
\[ \text{mid} = \left(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1\right) // 2 \]

This means `mid` is the integer division of the difference between `right` and `left` plus one, by 2.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`.**
