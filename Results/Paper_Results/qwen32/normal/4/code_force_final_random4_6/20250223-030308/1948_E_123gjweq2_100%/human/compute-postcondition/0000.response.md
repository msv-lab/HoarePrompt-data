The value of `small_element` is set to `left + 1`. The values of `left`, `right`, `n`, and `clique` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, and `small_element` is `left + 1`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`**.
