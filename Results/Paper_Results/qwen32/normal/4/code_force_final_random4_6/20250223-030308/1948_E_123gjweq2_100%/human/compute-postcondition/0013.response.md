To determine the output state after the loop has executed all of its iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the array `arr` and the list `cliquess`.

The loop runs for `mid` iterations, where `mid` is calculated as `(right - left + 1) // 2`. During each iteration `i` (ranging from 0 to `mid - 1`), the loop performs the following operations:
1. `arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i`
2. `cliquess[left + i] = clique`

Let's break down the changes made to `arr` and `cliquess` for all iterations:

### Initialization:
- `small_element = left + 1`
- `mid = (right - left + 1) // 2`

### Iterations:
For each iteration `i` from 0 to `mid - 1`:
- `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is set to `small_element + i`
- `cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique`

### Final State:
After all iterations, the loop will have modified `arr` and `cliquess` as follows:
- For `arr`, the indices `left + mid - mid`, `left + mid - mid + 1`, ..., `left + mid - 1` (which are `left`, `left + 1`, ..., `left + mid - 1`) will be set to `small_element`, `small_element + 1`, ..., `small_element + mid - 1` respectively.
- For `cliquess`, the indices `left`, `left + 1`, ..., `left + mid - 1` will all be set to `clique`.

### Calculation:
- `small_element = left + 1`
- The loop runs `mid` times, so the indices modified in `arr` are from `left` to `left + mid - 1`.
- The indices modified in `cliquess` are also from `left` to `left + mid - 1`.

### Output State:
The final output state will be:
- `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` will be `left + 1` to `left + mid`.
- `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` will all be `clique`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are `left + 1` to `left + mid`, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all `clique`.**

In simpler terms, the elements in `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` will be filled with consecutive numbers starting from `left + 1`, and the elements in `cliquess` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` will all be set to the value of `clique`.
