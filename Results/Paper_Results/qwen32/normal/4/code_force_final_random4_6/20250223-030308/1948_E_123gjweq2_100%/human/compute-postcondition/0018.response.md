The code modifies the value of `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i`. Given the initial state, `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` are initially set to `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`. After the execution of the code snippet, the value at `arr[left + mid + i]` will be updated to `big_element - i`.

Since the other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, and the values of `arr` and `cliquess` at other indices) remain unchanged, the output state will reflect the updated value at `arr[left + mid + i]`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are `left + 1` to `left + mid`, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` are `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` except `arr[left + mid + i]` which is `big_element - i`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
