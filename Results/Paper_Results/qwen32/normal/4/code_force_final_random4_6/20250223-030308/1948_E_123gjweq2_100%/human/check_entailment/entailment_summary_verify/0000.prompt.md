You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 3
    
    5 4
    
    8 16

Output

    2 1
    1
    1 1
    3 1 5 2 4
    2
    1 1 2 1 2
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
    1
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

- Program:
from math import ceil
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

#Function 2:
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `make_array` populates a portion of the `arr` array with a sequence of numbers from `left + 1` to `right + 1`, splitting this sequence into two parts: the first half in ascending order and the second half in descending order. It also assigns the value of `clique` to the corresponding elements in the `cliquess` array.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are the main problems:

1. **Global Variables**: The `arr` and `cliquess` variables are used inside the `make_array` function, but they are not defined as global variables. This will result in a `UnboundLocalError` when the function tries to modify them.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when `k` is small relative to `n`. For example, if `k` is 1, the program should create a separate clique for each vertex because no two vertices can be connected.

3. **Incorrect Clustering Logic**: The logic for creating cliques and assigning values to vertices is flawed. The program does not guarantee that all pairs of vertices within a clique are connected according to the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the results directly instead of returning them, which is not suitable for a function that should return the results for further processing or testing.

### Example of Incorrect Output:
Consider the input:
```
2
5 1
5 2
```

The program should output something like:
```
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1
1 1 1 1 1
```
But the current implementation will not produce this output correctly due to the issues mentioned above.

### Correct Implementation Example:
Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(n, k):
    arr = list(range(1, n + 1))  # Assign distinct integers 1 to n to vertices
    cliques = []
    clique_count = 0
    
    # Create cliques based on the condition
    for i in range(n):
        if all(abs(i - j) + abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) > k for j in range(len(cliques))):
            clique_count += 1
            cliques.append([i])
        else:
            for c in cliques:
                if all(abs(i - j) + abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) <= k for j in c):
                    c.append(i)
                    break
    
    # Prepare the output
    clique_labels = [0] * n
    for i, c in enumerate(cliques):
        for j in c:
            clique_labels[j] = i + 1
    
    return arr, len(cliques), clique_labels

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    t = int(input[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        k = int(input[index + 1])
        index += 2
        arr, q, cliques = func_1(n, k)
        results.append(f"{' '.join(map(str, arr))}\n{q}\n{' '.join(map(str, cliques))}")
    print('\n'.join(results))

# Uncomment the following line to run the main function
# main()
```

This corrected version ensures that each vertex is assigned a distinct integer, and it creates the minimum number of cliques such that all pairs of vertices within each clique are connected according to the given condition.
