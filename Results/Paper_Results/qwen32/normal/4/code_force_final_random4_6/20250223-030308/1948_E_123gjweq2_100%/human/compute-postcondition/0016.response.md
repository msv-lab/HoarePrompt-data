The code snippet modifies the array `cliquess` by setting the element at index `left + mid + i` to the value of `clique`. This means that the element at the specified index in the `cliquess` array will now hold the value of `clique`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is the element in the `cliquess` array at the specific index. The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are `left + 1` to `left + mid`, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` are `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`.**
