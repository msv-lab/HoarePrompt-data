### Reasoning:
The given program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `make_array`, which are supposed to solve the problem of assigning integers to vertices and partitioning the resulting graph into the minimum number of cliques.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of `n / k`. This is a reasonable approach because it tries to distribute the vertices into groups (cliques) such that each group can potentially form a clique.
- It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, to store the assigned integers and the clique assignments for each vertex, respectively.
- It then iterates through the calculated number of cliques and calls `make_array` to populate `arr` and `cliquess` for each clique.

#### Analysis of `make_array`:
- `make_array` is responsible for filling a segment of the `arr` array with numbers from `left + 1` to `right + 1` in a specific order: the first half in ascending order and the second half in descending order.
- It also assigns the same clique number to the vertices in the segment in the `cliquess` array.

#### Issues and Considerations:
1. **Correctness of Clique Partitioning**:
   - The approach of splitting the vertices into `ceil(n / k)` segments and assigning numbers in a specific order within each segment is not guaranteed to produce the minimum number of cliques. The problem requires that every pair of vertices (i, j) with `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` must form an edge, and the current method does not ensure this condition for all pairs within the same clique.
   - The current method does not consider the actual edge conditions between vertices to form valid cliques.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The output format of the program matches the problem statement in terms of the required lines and values, but the correctness of the values themselves is questionable due to the above issues.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques based on the edge conditions. The current method of assigning numbers and forming cliques does not guarantee that every pair of vertices within the same clique will have an edge between them.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness: **False**
