The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `not_mid`. If `i` is less than `not_mid`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

Given that `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2` and must be greater than 0, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `not_mid`.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are `left + 1` to `left + mid`, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` are `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` except `arr[left + mid + i]` which is `big_element - i`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Since `i` was incremented at the end of the previous iteration, we need to reflect that in the state for the start of the next iteration:

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are `left + 1` to `left + mid`, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` are `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` except `arr[left + mid + i]` which is `big_element - i`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**

To be more specific, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are `left + 1` to `left + mid`, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` are `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` except `arr[left + mid + i]` which is `big_element - i`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, we need to reflect that in the state for the start of the next iteration:

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are `left + 1` to `left + mid`, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` are `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` except `arr[left + mid + i]` which is `big_element - i`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**

Given the previous iteration's state, if `i` was `x`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are `left + 1` to `left + mid`, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` are `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` except `arr[left + mid + i]` which is `big_element - i`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
