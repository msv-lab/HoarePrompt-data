You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to:
1. Assign distinct integers from 1 to n to the vertices of a graph.
2. Add edges between vertices (i, j) if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k.
3. Partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
4. Print the assignments, the number of cliques, and the partitioning.

### Program Analysis:
The given program defines two functions:
1. `func_1(n, k)`: This function is supposed to assign values to vertices, determine the number of cliques, and print the required outputs.
2. `make_array(left, right, clique)`: This function is supposed to populate the array with values and assign clique numbers.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess` without defining them within the functions. This is not a good practice and can lead to errors if the variables are not defined outside the functions.
2. **Incorrect Clique Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`, which is not necessarily the minimum number of cliques required. The problem requires finding a partition into the minimum number of cliques.
3. **Incorrect Array Population**: The function `make_array` does not correctly populate the array `arr` and `cliquess`. It assigns values to the array but does not ensure that the graph formed by these values can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
4. **Output Format**: The program prints the output directly from within the function, which might not be the desired behavior if the program needs to handle multiple test cases correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for determining the number of cliques and assigning values to vertices is flawed, and it does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
