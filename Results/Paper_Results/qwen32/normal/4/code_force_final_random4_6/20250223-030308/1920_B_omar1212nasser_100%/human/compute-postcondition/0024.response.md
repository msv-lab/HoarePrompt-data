To determine the output state, we need to consider the final state of the `pos` list and identify the maximum value within it. The `pos` list is described as containing `removals + 1` elements, starting with an initial value and followed by `removals` additional values calculated as `s - 2 * s2` after each iteration. The final value of `s` is the result of decrementing `s` by the sum of the last `removals` elements of `elements`. However, the specific values of `s` and `s2` are not provided, and `removals` is an unknown but fixed value.

Given the task, the output will be the maximum value in the `pos` list. Since the exact values of the elements in `pos` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the `pos` list.

Output State: **The program returns the maximum value in the `pos` list, which contains `removals + 1` elements starting with an initial value and followed by `removals` additional values calculated as `s - 2 * s2` after each iteration.**
