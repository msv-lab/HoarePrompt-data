Let's break down the program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
- Alice removes up to `k` elements from the array to maximize the sum.
- Bob then multiplies up to `x` elements by -1 to minimize the sum.
- Both players play optimally.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n`, `k`, and `x` are read, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is crucial because it helps in determining which elements Alice should remove and which Bob should negate.

3. **Logic in `func_2`:**
   - The initial sum `s` of the array is calculated.
   - The initial sum of the `x` largest elements (`s2`) is calculated. This is because Bob will try to negate the largest possible elements to minimize the sum.
   - The initial `pos` is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`. This is because negating the `x` largest elements means subtracting `2 * sum(largest x elements)` from the total sum.
   - For each possible number of elements Alice can remove (from 1 to `k`), the sum `s` is updated by subtracting the `i`th largest element. `s2` is also updated accordingly.
   - The new possible sum is calculated and appended to the `pos` list.
   - Finally, the maximum value from the `pos` list is returned, which represents the optimal sum after both players have played optimally.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Sorting:** Sorting the array in ascending order is crucial for determining which elements are the largest and smallest.
- **Calculating `pos`:** The `pos` list is calculated correctly by considering all possible numbers of elements Alice can remove and updating the sum `s` and `s2` accordingly.
- **Maximizing the Result:** The maximum value from the `pos` list is returned, which represents the optimal sum after both players have played optimally.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the optimal sum after both players have played optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
