The code snippet appends a calculated value to the list `pos`. The value being appended is `s - 2 * s2`. This operation does not affect the values of `removals`, `i`, `s`, or `s2` directly, but it does change the list `pos` by adding a new element to it.

Output State: **`removals` is greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `s` is `s - elements[-i]`. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s2` is `s2 - elements[-i] + elements[-(negatives + i)]`. Otherwise, `s2` is `s2 - elements[-i]`. `pos` now includes an additional element which is `s - 2 * s2`.**
