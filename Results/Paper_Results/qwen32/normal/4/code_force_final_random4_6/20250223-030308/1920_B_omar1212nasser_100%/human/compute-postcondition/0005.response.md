The code snippet `s -= elements[-i]` subtracts the `i`-th element from the end of the list `elements` from the variable `s`. Given that `removals` is greater than 0, this precondition does not directly affect the execution of the given line of code, but it is still part of the context and remains true after the execution.

The value of `s` is updated to be its previous value minus the value of `elements[-i]`. The values of `removals`, `elements`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`removals` is greater than 0; `s` is updated to `s - elements[-i]`; `elements` is unchanged; `i` is unchanged.**
