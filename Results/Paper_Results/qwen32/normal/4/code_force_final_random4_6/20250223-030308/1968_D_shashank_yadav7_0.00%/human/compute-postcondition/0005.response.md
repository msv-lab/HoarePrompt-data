Output State: **`t` is the integer value obtained from the input, which must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n`, `k`, and `s` are the four integers obtained from the input; `b` is the integer obtained from the input minus 1; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

In simple terms, `b` has been decreased by 1, and all other variables retain their initial values.
