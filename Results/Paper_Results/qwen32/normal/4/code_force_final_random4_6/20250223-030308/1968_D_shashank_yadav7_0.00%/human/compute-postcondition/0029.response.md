The code snippet `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` updates the value of `sm` by adding the maximum of the current value of `sm` and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`.

Given the initial state:
- `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `b`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is -1 if the initial value of `k` was 0, otherwise `k` is `k - 1`; `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`; `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`; `p`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain as described in the initial state; `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `sp` is `sp + a[s]`; `bp` is `bp + a[b]`.**

In simpler terms:
- `sm` is updated to be the sum of its current value and the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`.
- All other variables retain their initial values.
