Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `sp` is `sp + a[s]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
