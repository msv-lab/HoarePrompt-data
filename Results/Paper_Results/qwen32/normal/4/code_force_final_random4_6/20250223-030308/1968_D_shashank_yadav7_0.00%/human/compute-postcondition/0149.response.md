The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a simple string:

```python
print('Sasha')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The string 'Sasha' is explicitly provided and will be printed as is. 

Here is the detailed reasoning:

- The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `k`, `bm`, `sm`, `bp`, `sp`) and their relationships or update rules, but these are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply outputs the string 'Sasha'.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Sasha**
