Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input minus 1, `s` is the fourth integer from the input minus 1, `p` is a new list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `k` is the second integer from the input, `sp` is `a[s]`. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, the condition holds; otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.**

In this output state, the value of `sm` has been updated to `a[s] * k`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
