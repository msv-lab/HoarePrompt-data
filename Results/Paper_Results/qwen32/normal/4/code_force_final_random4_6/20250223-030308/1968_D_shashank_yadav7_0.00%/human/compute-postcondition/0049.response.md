The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state provides a detailed description of how several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`) are defined and updated over a series of iterations. However, none of these variables are directly involved in the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is simply:
```python
print('Draw')
```

This statement will output the string `'Draw'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **Draw**
