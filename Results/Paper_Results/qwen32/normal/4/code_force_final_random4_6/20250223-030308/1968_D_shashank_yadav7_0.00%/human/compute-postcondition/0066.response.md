Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0 (the second integer from the input minus 1), `b` is the third integer from the input minus 1, `s` is the fourth integer from the input minus 1, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is `a[b] * 0`, `sm` is `a[s] * 0`, `sp` is `a[s]`, and `bp` is `a[b]`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
