Postcondition: **`t` is the integer value obtained from the input, which must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` is true; `s`, `b`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` remain as described in the initial state. If `k` is not 0, these variables and `k` remain unchanged.**
