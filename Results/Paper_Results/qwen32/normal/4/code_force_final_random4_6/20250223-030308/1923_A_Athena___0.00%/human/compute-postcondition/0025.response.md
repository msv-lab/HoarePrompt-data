The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Given the initial state, if `a[i]` is 0, `res` was initially 1, and if `a[i]` is not 0, `res` was initially 0. After the increment, if `a[i]` was 0, `res` becomes 2, and if `a[i]` was not 0, `res` becomes 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input with all leading zeros and trailing zeros removed and must have at least 1 element; `i` is 1; if `a[i]` is 0, `res` is 2; otherwise, `res` is 1.**
