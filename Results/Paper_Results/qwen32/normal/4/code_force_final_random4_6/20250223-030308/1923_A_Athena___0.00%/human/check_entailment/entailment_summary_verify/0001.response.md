Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and its correctness based on the problem description and the function summary.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list `a` of binary integers.

2. **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` using `pop(0)` and `pop()`. This step is correct because these free cells at the ends do not affect the minimum number of operations needed to group the chips together.

3. **Counting Operations:**
   - The program then counts the number of zeros in the trimmed list `a` and prints this count as the result. Each zero represents a free cell that needs to be filled by a chip from the right, which means an operation is needed for each zero.

### Function Summary:
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of binary integers (0s and 1s) with at least one 1. For each test case, it removes leading and trailing zeros, then counts and prints the number of zeros remaining in the list.

### Correctness Check:
- **Trimming the List:** The removal of leading and trailing zeros is correct because these free cells do not need to be considered in the process of forming a contiguous block of chips.
- **Counting Operations:** The number of operations needed is indeed the number of zeros in the trimmed list. Each zero represents a free cell that needs to be filled by a chip from the right, which requires an operation.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's verify the program with the first example from the problem statement:
- Input: `8`, `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
- After trimming, the list becomes `1 1 1 0 1 1`.
- The number of zeros in the trimmed list is `1`, which matches the expected output.

### Additional Example Walkthrough:
Let's verify the program with another example:
- Input: `5`, `1 0 1 0 1`
- After trimming, the list becomes `1 0 1 0 1`.
- The number of zeros in the trimmed list is `2`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the minimum number of operations for each test case based on the problem description and the provided examples. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
