The code snippet `n = int(input())` will overwrite the value of `n` with the integer value of the input provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`, and `res`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` < 1000; `n` is the integer value of the input; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input with all leading zeros and trailing zeros removed; `i` is `len(a) - 1`; `res` is the total number of `0`s in the list `a`.**
