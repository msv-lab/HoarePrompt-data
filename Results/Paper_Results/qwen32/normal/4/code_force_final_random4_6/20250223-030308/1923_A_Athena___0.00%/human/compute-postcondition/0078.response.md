To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head: `a and a[-1] == 0`. 

1. **Condition `a`**: This condition checks if the list `a` is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a list that is not empty (with the last element `0` removed). For the loop to execute again, `a` must still be non-empty after the last element `0` has been removed. Therefore, `a` must have at least one element before the last `0` is removed.

2. **Condition `a[-1] == 0`**: This condition checks if the last element of the list `a` is `0`. Since the last element `0` has been removed at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that a new `0` is added to the end of the list `a` for the loop to execute again.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state of `a` to ensure that it is non-empty and its last element is `0`.

State: **`a` is a list that is not empty and its last element is `0`, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `res` is `0`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer**.
