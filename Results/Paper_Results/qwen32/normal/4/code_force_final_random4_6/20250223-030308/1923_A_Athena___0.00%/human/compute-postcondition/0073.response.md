Output State: **`a` is a list with all leading zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `res` is `0`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer.**

In simpler terms, the list `a` will no longer have any zeros at the beginning after the loop finishes executing. The variable `i` will be updated to the index of the last element in the modified list `a`. The variables `res`, `t`, and `n` will remain unchanged from their initial states.
