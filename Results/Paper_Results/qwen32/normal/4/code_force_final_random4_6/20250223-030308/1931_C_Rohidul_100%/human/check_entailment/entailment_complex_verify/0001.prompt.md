You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

    #State: t is 0, and the corresponding ans values for each of the initial t test cases have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list `a` to ensure that the remaining list does not have the same starting and ending elements, unless the entire list is uniform.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding the minimum cost (in burles) to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation where a contiguous subarray can be set to a specific value. The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Iterating through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the array size `n` and the array `a`.
3. It then tries to find the longest prefix and suffix of the array that consists of the same element.
4. It calculates the cost to make the entire array equal to the element in the longest prefix or suffix.
5. If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it adjusts the cost by considering the combined length of the longest prefix and suffix.

However, this approach has several issues:
- It does not consider the possibility of making the array equal to an element that is not at the beginning or end of the array.
- It does not correctly handle cases where making the array equal to an element in the middle might result in a lower cost.
- The logic for combining the prefix and suffix lengths when the first and last elements are the same is flawed.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all possible scenarios and edge cases. It only considers making the array equal to the element at the beginning or end, which is not always optimal.

### Example Counter-Case

Consider the array `[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]`. The program will find a prefix of length 1 (`[3]`) and a suffix of length 3 (`[3, 1, 3]`). It will then calculate the cost as `6 - max(1, 3) = 3`. However, the optimal solution is to make the entire array equal to `3` by setting the middle part `[1, 3, 1]` to `3`, which costs `3` burles. In this case, the program's output is correct, but it is not a general solution.

However, consider another example: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The program will find a prefix of length 1 (`[1]`) and a suffix of length 1 (`[5]`). It will then calculate the cost as `5 - max(1, 1) = 4`. However, the optimal solution is to make the entire array equal to any single element, which costs `4` burles (e.g., setting the entire array to `1` or `5`). The program's output is correct, but it is not because of a general correct approach.

### Conclusion

The program does not guarantee the correct solution for all possible inputs. It only works for specific cases and does not consider the most optimal solution in general.
