The code snippet `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. Given the initial state, `end` was 3, so after the increment, `end` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers where `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is `n - 3`; `r` is `n - 3`; `st` is the length of the sequence of consecutive equal elements from the start; `end` is 4**.
