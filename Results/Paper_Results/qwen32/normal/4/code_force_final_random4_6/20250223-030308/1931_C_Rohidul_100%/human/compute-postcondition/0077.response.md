To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior and the given initial and intermediate states.

The loop continues to execute as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`. Each iteration increments `l` by 1 and `st` by 1. This means that the loop will continue to run as long as the elements starting from the first element are all equal.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After 1 iteration, `a[0] == a[1]` and `l` becomes 1, `st` becomes 2.
- After 2 iterations, `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]` and `l` becomes 2, `st` becomes 3.
- After 3 iterations, `a[0] == a[1] == a[2] == a[3]` and `l` becomes 3, `st` becomes 4.

The loop will stop when either `l` is no longer less than `r` or `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l + 1]`. Therefore, the final value of `l` will be the position of the first element that is not equal to `a[0]` or `r` if all elements are equal.

Let's denote the length of the sequence of equal elements starting from `a[0]` as `k`. The loop will run `k-1` times, so `l` will be `k-1` and `st` will be `k` when the loop stops.

The final state will be:
- `l` will be `k-1`.
- `st` will be `k`.
- `r` will remain `n - 1`.
- `end` will remain 1.
- `ans` will be `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `le - max(st, end)`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `k-1` where `k` is the length of the sequence of equal elements starting from `a[0]`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is `k`, `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `le - max(st, end)`**

In simpler terms, the loop will stop when it encounters the first element that is not equal to the first element or when it reaches the end of the list if all elements are equal. The final state will reflect the position and count of these equal elements.
