Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1] == a[2] == a[3]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 3; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 3; `end` is 1; `ans` retains its original value.**

Natural Language: The value of `l` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables retain their original values.
