The code snippet `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. Given the initial state, `st` was 3. After executing the code, `st` becomes 4.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` must still be at least 3.
- `a` is still a list of integers with at least three elements where `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]`.
- `le` is still the length of the list `a`.
- `l` is still 4.
- `r` is still `n - 1`.
- `end` is still 1.
- `ans` is still calculated based on the initial conditions: `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `le - max(st, end)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers with at least three elements where `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 4, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 4, `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `le - max(st, end)`**.
