The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to the integer value of the input provided. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `le`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, `ans`) remain unchanged. Since the input value for `n` is not specified, we denote it as `an input integer`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is the index where the sequence of consecutive equal elements from the start ends or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is `l`; `st` is the length of the sequence of consecutive equal elements from the start; `end` is the length of the sequence of consecutive equal elements from `l` to the end of the list. If the first and last elements of `a` are equal, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Otherwise, `ans` retains its original value, which is `le - max(st, end)`**.
