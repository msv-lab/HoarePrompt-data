Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is an index such that `l < n - 1` and `a[l] != a[l + 1]`, `r` is `l`, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list until the first element that is not equal to its subsequent element, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**

Natural language explanation: The value of `ans` is now calculated as the length of the list `a` minus the maximum of `st` (the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element) and `end` (the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list until the first element that is not equal to its subsequent element). All other variables retain their original values.
