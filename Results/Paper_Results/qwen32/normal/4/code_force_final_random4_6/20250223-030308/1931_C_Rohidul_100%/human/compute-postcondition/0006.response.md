To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]` is true.

1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - `l < r`: This condition ensures that the left index `l` is strictly less than the right index `r`.
   - `a[l] == a[l + 1]`: This condition ensures that the element at index `l` is equal to the element at index `l + 1` in the list `a`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (This variable is not used in the loop condition, so it can remain unchanged).
   - `n` is an input integer (This variable is used to determine the value of `r`, so it must be adjusted if necessary).
   - `a` is a list of integers derived from the input (This list is directly used in the loop condition, so it must be adjusted if necessary).
   - `le` is the length of the list `a` (This variable is not used in the loop condition, so it can remain unchanged).
   - `l` is 0 (This is the starting index for the loop, so it can remain unchanged).
   - `r` is `n - 1` (This is the ending index for the loop, so `n` must be adjusted if necessary).
   - `st` is 1 (This variable is not used in the loop condition, so it can remain unchanged).
   - `end` is 1 (This variable is not used in the loop condition, so it can remain unchanged).

3. **Adjustments**:
   - **Adjust `n` and `a`**: To ensure `l < r`, `n` must be at least 2 (so that `r` is at least 1). Additionally, to ensure `a[l] == a[l + 1]`, the first two elements of the list `a` must be equal.

Given these considerations, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 2 and ensure that the first two elements of `a` are equal.

**Adjusted State**:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is at least 2.
- `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1]`.
- `le` is the length of the list `a`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `st` is 1.
- `end` is 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is at least 2; `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 1; `end` is 1**
