Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `k-1` where `k` is the length of the sequence of equal elements starting from `a[0]`, `r` is `l`, `st` is `k`, `end` is the length of the sequence of equal elements from the end of the list `a`, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`, and `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.**
