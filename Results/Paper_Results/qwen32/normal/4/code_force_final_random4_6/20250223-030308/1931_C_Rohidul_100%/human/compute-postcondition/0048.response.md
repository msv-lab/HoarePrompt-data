The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given that `r` was initially `n - 1`, after the execution, `r` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is an index such that `l < n - 1` and `a[l] != a[l + 1]`, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, `end` is 1, `ans` retains its original value.**
