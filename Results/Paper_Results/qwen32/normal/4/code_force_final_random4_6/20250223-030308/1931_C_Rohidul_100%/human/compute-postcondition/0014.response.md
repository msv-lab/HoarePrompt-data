The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `st` is 3, so after the increment, `st` becomes 4. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is at least 4; `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 3; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 4; `end` is 1**.
