Output State: **`c` is a string with at least one character, `x` is the next character in the string `c`, `no` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the values of `c`, `x`, and `no` remain unchanged, but the execution will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
