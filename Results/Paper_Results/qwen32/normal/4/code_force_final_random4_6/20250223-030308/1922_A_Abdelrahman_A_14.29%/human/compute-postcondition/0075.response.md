The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `c` and the current value of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is a string with at least one character. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be the next character in the string `c`.

Let's denote the current value of `x` as `c[i]`, where `i` is the current index. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was `c[i]`. For the next iteration, `x` should be `c[i+1]`.

State: **`c` is a string with at least one character, `x` is the next character in the string `c`**
