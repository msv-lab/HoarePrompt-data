You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains the number of test cases, the number of cows, the index of a specific cow, and a list of Cowdeforces ratings for the cows. It returns an integer value based on the ratings of the cows relative to the specified cow's rating. The return value represents a calculated index or count based on the conditions specified in the code.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly determine the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve by either doing nothing or swapping once optimally. 

Let's examine the issues with the code:

1. **Variable `n` is not defined within `func_1`**: The variable `n` is used in the loop but it is not passed as a parameter to `func_1`. This will cause a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect logic for determining wins**: The function `func_1` tries to determine the number of wins by finding the first two cows with ratings higher than your cow's rating. However, this logic does not consider the optimal swap or the sequence of matches correctly. It does not account for the possibility of swapping your cow with another cow in a way that maximizes her wins.

3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**: The function does not correctly handle cases where your cow is already in a position to win multiple matches or where the optimal strategy involves swapping with a cow in a specific position.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
1 3 5 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Initially, the order is [1, 3, 5, 2, 4].
- The first match is between 1 and 3, 3 wins.
- The second match is between 3 and 5, 5 wins.
- The third match is between 5 and 2, 5 wins.
- The fourth match is between 5 and 4, 5 wins.

So, cow 3 wins 2 matches if no swap is done.

However, if you swap cow 3 with cow 4, the order becomes [1, 3, 4, 2, 5].
- The first match is between 1 and 3, 3 wins.
- The second match is between 3 and 4, 4 wins.
- The third match is between 4 and 2, 4 wins.
- The fourth match is between 4 and 5, 5 wins.

Cow 4 (originally cow 3) wins 2 matches.

The provided code does not account for such optimal swaps and thus would not produce the correct result for this input.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
