Output State: **The program returns the maximum of (k - ind[0]) and (ind[0] - 1), where ind[0] is a non-zero index less than or equal to k, and c is 1.**

To break it down:
- `ind` contains one index of a cow with a rating greater than `x`, and this index (`ind[0]`) is not 0 and is less than or equal to `k`.
- The function returns the larger value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
