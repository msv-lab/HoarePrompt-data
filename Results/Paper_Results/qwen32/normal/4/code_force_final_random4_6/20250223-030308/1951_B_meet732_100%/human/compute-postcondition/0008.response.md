Postcondition: **`a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `t`, `n` (must be greater than 0), `k`, and a list of `n` integers; `x` is the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at index `k`; `i` is 0. The current value of `c` is 2. `ind` remains an empty list. The current value of the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is not greater than `x`.**

(Note: The postcondition provided seems contradictory as `c` being 2 contradicts the given logic where `c` can only be 1 or 0 based on the provided if condition logic. However, based on the task, we are to include the if condition in the postcondition, even if it seems contradictory.)
