a is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n), followed by a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), with all a_i's being pairwise different. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
