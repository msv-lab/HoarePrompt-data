#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cows, an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing your cow's index, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. It is guaranteed that the a_i's are pairwise different, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains the number of test cases, the number of cows, the index of a specific cow, and a list of Cowdeforces ratings for the cows. It returns an integer value based on the ratings of the cows relative to the specified cow's rating. The return value represents a calculated index or count based on the conditions specified in the code.
