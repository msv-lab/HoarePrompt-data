The code snippet `ind.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `ind`. Given the initial state, `ind` was an empty list, and `i` is 0. After appending, `ind` will contain the single element `[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `t`, `n` (must be greater than 0), `k`, and a list of `n` integers; `x` is the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at index `k`; `ind` is `[0]`; `c` is 0; `i` is 0 and the current value of the first element of tuple at index `i` in `a` is greater than `x`.**
