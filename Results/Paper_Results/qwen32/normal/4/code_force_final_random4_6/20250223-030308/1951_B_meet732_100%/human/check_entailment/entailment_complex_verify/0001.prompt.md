You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains the number of test cases, the number of cows, the index of a specific cow, and a list of Cowdeforces ratings for the cows. It returns an integer value based on the ratings of the cows relative to the specified cow's rating. The return value represents a calculated index or count based on the conditions specified in the code.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of matches cow `k` can win in a tournament where cows are ranked by their Cowdeforces ratings. Cow `k` can swap positions with another cow once or choose not to swap. The goal is to maximize the number of matches cow `k` wins.

### Key Points
1. **Initial Position**: Cow `k` starts at position `k` (1-indexed).
2. **Match Rules**: Matches proceed sequentially, with the winner of the previous match playing against the next cow in line.
3. **Winning Condition**: The cow with the higher rating wins.
4. **Swap Option**: Cow `k` can swap positions with one other cow once, or not swap at all.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the program to see if it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of wins for cow `k`.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cows) and `k` (index of cow `k`).
   - It then reads the list of ratings.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the list of ratings.
   - Inside `func_1`, it finds the ratings greater than the rating of cow `k` and stores their indices.
   - If there are no ratings greater than cow `k`, it returns `n-1` assuming cow `k` wins all matches.
   - If there is only one rating greater than cow `k`, it calculates the number of wins based on the position of that rating.
   - If there are two or more ratings greater than cow `k`, it calculates the number of wins based on the positions of the first two ratings greater than cow `k`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Global Variable `n`**: The variable `n` is used in `func_1`, but it is not defined within the function or passed as an argument. This will cause a `NameError`.
2. **Incorrect Logic for Calculating Wins**:
   - The logic for calculating the number of wins is incorrect. For example, if there are two ratings greater than cow `k`, the program does not correctly account for the possibility of swapping to win more matches.
   - The program does not consider all possible swaps that could maximize the number of wins for cow `k`.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of wins for cow `k`.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the use of an undefined global variable and incorrect logic for calculating the maximum number of wins.
