Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is not divisible by 2, and `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`.**
