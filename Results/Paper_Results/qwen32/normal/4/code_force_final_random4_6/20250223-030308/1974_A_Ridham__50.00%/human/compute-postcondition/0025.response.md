The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. This affects the values of `x` and `y` but does not change any other variables. The initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are integers read from the input, and their values are updated by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is `n - 1`; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `space_x` is equal to `x`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`; If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is not divisible by 2, and `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`; `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing one element, which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, or `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15. `x` and `y` are updated to the values read from the input.**
