Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `result` is a list containing one element, which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `space_x` is equal to `x`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`; If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is not divisible by 2, and `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`; `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`; `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`. If `space_x` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is `space_x // 15`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1`.**

In simple terms, the `result` list now contains one element, which is the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`. All other variables retain their initial values or calculations as described.
