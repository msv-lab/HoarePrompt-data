The given code snippet updates the value of `total_space` by recalculating it as the sum of `space_y` and `space_x`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is `n + 1`; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing one element, which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, or `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15. `x` and `y` are updated to the values read from the input. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains one element, `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains two elements, both equal to `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.**
