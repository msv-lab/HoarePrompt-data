Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is `n + 1`
- `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99
- `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`
- `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`
- `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`
- If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`
- `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`
- `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`

The code snippet:
```
extra_screen = space_x // 15
```

Impact of the code:
- `extra_screen` is assigned the value of `space_x // 15`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is `n + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is `space_x // 15`.**
