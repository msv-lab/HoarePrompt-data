Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is `n + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`. `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `extra_screen` is calculated as the integer division of `extra_space` by 15 plus 1. All other variables retain their previously defined values and conditions.
