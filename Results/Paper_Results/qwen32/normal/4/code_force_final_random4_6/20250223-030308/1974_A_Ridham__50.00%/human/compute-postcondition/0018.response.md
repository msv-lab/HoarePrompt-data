The code snippet calculates `extra_screen` by performing integer division of `space_x` by 15. This affects the value of `extra_screen` while all other variables retain their initial conditions or calculated values based on the initial state.

Given:
- `space_x` is equal to `x` and `space_x % 15 == 0`
- `extra_screen` is calculated as `space_x // 15`

Since `space_x % 15 == 0`, `space_x` is a multiple of 15. Therefore, `extra_screen` will be the integer part of `space_x` divided by 15, which is `space_x / 15`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `result` is an empty list; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `space_x` is equal to `x` and `space_x % 15 == 0`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`; If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is not divisible by 2, and `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`; `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`; `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`; `extra_screen` is `space_x // 15`.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `extra_screen` is now equal to `space_x // 15`. All other variables remain the same as per the initial state.
