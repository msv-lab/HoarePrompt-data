The code snippet initializes an empty list named `result`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a specific range and that for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` within a specific range. The variable `n` is also mentioned as an input integer, but it is not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the initialization of the `result` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is an input integer; `result` is an empty list.**
