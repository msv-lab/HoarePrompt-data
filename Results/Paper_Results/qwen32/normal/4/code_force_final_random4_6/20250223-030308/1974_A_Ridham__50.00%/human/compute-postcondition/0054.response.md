Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is `n + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`. If `space_x % 15 == 0`, `extra_screen` is `space_x // 15`; otherwise, `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1`. `result` is a list that now includes `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.**

In natural language, the output state means that the variable `result` has been updated to include the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`. All other variables retain their previously defined values and conditions.
