The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates numbers starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have taken the value of `n`, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still be within the range.

Given that `n` must be at least 1, at the end of the last iteration, `i` would be `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented to `n + 1`, but since the loop condition checks if `i` is less than `n + 1`, `i` should be `n` at the start of the next iteration, and `n` should be at least 2 to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is n**
