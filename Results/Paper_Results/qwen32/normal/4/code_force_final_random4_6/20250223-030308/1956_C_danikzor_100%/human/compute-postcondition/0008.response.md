To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how the loop progresses. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`, which means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be at least 2, and `i` is `n`.

Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, this means the loop has just finished executing for the last value of `i` (which is `n`). To execute one more time, `i` would need to be less than `n`, but since `i` is already `n`, the loop will not execute again with the current state.

However, if we are to adjust the state to hypothetically make the loop execute one more time, we need to set `i` to a value less than `n`. The logical step would be to set `i` to `n-1` so that it can increment to `n` and execute the loop one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration, adjusted to make the loop execute one more time, would be:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is `n-1`**
