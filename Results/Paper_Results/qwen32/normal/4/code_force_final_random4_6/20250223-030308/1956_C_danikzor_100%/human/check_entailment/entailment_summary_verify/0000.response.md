Let's re-evaluate the provided program based on the problem description, the program code, and the function summary.

### Problem Requirements:
We need to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. The operations can be of two types:
1. Assign a row \( i \) with a permutation \( p \) such that \( a[i, j] = p[j] \).
2. Assign a column \( i \) with a permutation \( p \) such that \( a[j, i] = p[j] \).

### Provided Program:
The program performs the following steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
3. It calculates the sum using the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \).
4. It prints \( 2n \) operations: for each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs:
   - Operation 1: Assign row \( i \) with the permutation \( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \).
   - Operation 2: Assign column \( i \) with the permutation \( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \).

### Function Summary:
The function `func_1`:
- Reads an integer \( n \).
- Prints the sum of squares of the first \( n \) natural numbers and twice the value of \( n \).
- Prints \( 2n \) lines, each pair consisting of a sequence starting with `1` and `2`, followed by the current index \( i \) and the sequence \( n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1 \).

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula used to calculate the sum \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) is incorrect for maximizing the sum of the matrix. This formula actually calculates the sum of squares of the first \( n \) natural numbers, which is not relevant to the problem.
   - The maximum sum should be \( n^3 \) because we can fill each cell with the highest possible value in a permutation, which is \( n \).

2. **Incorrect Operations**:
   - The operations described in the program do not maximize the sum. By filling each row and column with the permutation \( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \), the program does not ensure that each cell gets the highest value possible. Instead, it should fill each row and column with the permutation \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) to maximize the sum.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the sum, we should fill each row and column with the permutation \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \). This way, each cell will be filled with the value \( n \), resulting in a maximum sum of \( n^3 \).

### Correct Implementation:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    max_sum = n * n * n
    print(max_sum, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))
        print(2, i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
