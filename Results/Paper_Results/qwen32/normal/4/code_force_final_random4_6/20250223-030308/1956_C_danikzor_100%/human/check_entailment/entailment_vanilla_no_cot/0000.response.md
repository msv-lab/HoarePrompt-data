To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the maximum sum of the matrix and outputs the operations within the constraints.

### Analysis:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The maximum sum of the matrix is given by the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
   - This formula is derived from the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix where each row and each column contains a permutation of numbers from `1` to `n`. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is `n * (n + 1) / 2`, and the sum of squares is `n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6`. The formula provided is essentially the sum of all elements in the matrix when each element is optimally placed.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program outputs `2 * n` operations.
   - For each row `i` from `1` to `n`, it performs:
     - Type 1 operation: assigns the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` to the `i`-th row.
     - Type 2 operation: assigns the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` to the `i`-th column.
   - This operation ensures that each row and each column contains a permutation of numbers from `1` to `n`, which maximizes the sum of the matrix.

### Verification:

- **Sum Verification**:
  - For `n = 1`, the maximum sum is `1`, and the program outputs `1 1`, which is correct.
  - For `n = 2`, the maximum sum is `7`, and the program outputs `7 3`, which is correct.
- **Operations Verification**:
  - The operations ensure that each row and column contains a permutation of numbers from `1` to `n`, which is optimal for maximizing the sum.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly computes the maximum sum and outputs the operations within the constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
