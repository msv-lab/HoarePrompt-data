Let's break down the given task step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `i` is set to the value of `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `2`:** 
   - The first argument in the `print` function is the integer `2`.

2. **Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is set to the value of `n`, the second argument in the `print` function is the value of `n`.

3. **Value of `*range(n, 0, -1)`:**
   - The `range(n, 0, -1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n` down to `1` (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into individual arguments to the `print` function.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 5` (as an example, since `n` must be at least 2):
- `i` would be `5`.
- `range(5, 0, -1)` would generate the sequence `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

### Putting it all together:
- The `print` function will output `2`, followed by `i` (which is `5`), and then the unpacked sequence `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

### Generalized Output:
- The `print` function will output `2`, followed by `n`, and then the sequence generated by `range(n, 0, -1)`, which is `n, n-1, ..., 1`.

### Final Output:
Based on the above analysis, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **2, n, n, n-1, ..., 1 (where n is the given integer greater than or equal to 2)**
