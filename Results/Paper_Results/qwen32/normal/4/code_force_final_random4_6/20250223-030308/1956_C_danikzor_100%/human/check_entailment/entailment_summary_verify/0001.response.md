### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
- **Operations**:
  - Type 1: Fill a specified row with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
  - Type 2: Fill a specified column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

#### Program Code Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads the matrix size \( n \).
2. It calculates the maximum sum of the matrix using the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \).
3. It outputs \( 2n \) operations:
   - First \( n \) operations fill each row with the permutation \( [n, n-1, ..., 1] \).
   - Next \( n \) operations fill each column with the permutation \( [n, n-1, ..., 1] \).

#### Function Summary Recap:
- `func_1` reads \( n \), computes the maximum sum, and prints \( 2n \) operations as described above.

#### Verification:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) is correct for the maximum sum achievable when each row and column is filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, ..., 1] \).
   - This can be verified by noting that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly \( 2n-1 \) times in the matrix when both rows and columns are filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, ..., 1] \).

2. **Operations**:
   - The operations specified ensure that each row and each column is filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, ..., 1] \).
   - This guarantees that the matrix is filled optimally to achieve the maximum sum.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the problem requirements: it specifies the maximum sum, the number of operations, and the details of each operation.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the sum of the matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. The sum calculation and the operations specified are both correct and optimal.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
