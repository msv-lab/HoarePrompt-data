### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine if it is correct.

**Objective:**
Maximize the sum of all the numbers in an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with zeroes using no more than \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either modify a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

**Key Observations:**
1. **Sum of Squares:** The maximum sum of the matrix is the sum of the squares of the first \( n \) natural numbers, which is given by the formula:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}
   \]
   However, the provided program calculates:
   \[
   \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}
   \]
   This formula does not match the expected sum of squares. It seems there might be a mistake in the formula used in the program.

2. **Operations:**
   The program performs \( 2n \) operations, where each row and each column is set to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1] \). This means each row and each column will have the same values, but this does not necessarily maximize the sum.

3. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   To maximize the sum, we need to ensure that each unique number from 1 to \( n \) appears as many times as possible in the matrix. The optimal way to do this is to fill the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) in a way that maximizes the sum of the matrix.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), set the row to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - This will ensure that each row contributes the sum \( 1 + 2 + \ldots + n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \) to the total sum.
   - The total sum will be \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), which is the maximum possible sum for the matrix.

5. **Operations Count:**
   - Setting each of the \( n \) rows to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) requires \( n \) operations.
   - Therefore, the total number of operations is \( n \), which is within the limit of \( 2n \).

**Conclusion:**
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and does not follow the optimal strategy to maximize the sum of the matrix. The formula used for the sum is incorrect, and the operations do not ensure the maximum possible sum.

### Correctness: **False**
