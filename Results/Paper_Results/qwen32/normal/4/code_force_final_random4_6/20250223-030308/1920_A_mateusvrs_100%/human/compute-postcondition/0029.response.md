The given code snippet `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to a set named `cx`. However, `cx` is not defined in the initial state provided. Assuming `cx` is a set that should have been initialized before this operation, the impact of the code is that `x` is added to this set.

Since `cx` is not mentioned in the initial state, we will assume it was intended to be part of the initial state. Therefore, we will include `cx` in the output state and reflect the change made to it.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `x` is the second integer from the new input, `cx` is a set containing the value `x`.**
