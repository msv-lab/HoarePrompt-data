The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the set `cx`. Therefore, we can only adjust `i` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `ax` is the minimum of all `x` where `a` is 2.
- `bx` is the maximum of all `x` where `a` is 1.
- `cx` is a set of all unique `x` where `a` is 3 and must contain at least one element.
- `r` remains the same as per its initial conditions.
- `n` is 0.
- `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`.
- `i` is `i_next` where `i_next` is the next element in `cx`.
- If `bx <= i <= ax`, then `tmp` is 2. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 1.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be the next element in `cx`. Since `i` at the end of the previous iteration is `i_next`, the next value of `i` should be the subsequent element in `cx`.

Let's denote the next element in `cx` after `i_next` as `i_new`. The state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`ax` is the minimum of all `x` where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` where `a` is 3 and must contain at least one element, `r` remains the same as per its initial conditions, `n` is 0, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `i` is `i_new` where `i_new` is the next element in `cx`. If `bx <= i <= ax`, then `tmp` is 2. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 1.**
