Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `cx` is a set containing the value `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, and `a` is not equal to 1 and `a` is not equal to 2.**

In this output state, the set `cx` now contains the value `x`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
