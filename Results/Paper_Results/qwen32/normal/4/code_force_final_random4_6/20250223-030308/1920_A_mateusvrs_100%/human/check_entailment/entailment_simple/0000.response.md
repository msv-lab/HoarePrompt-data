### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem by processing multiple test cases, each with a set of constraints on an integer `k`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is read as the number of test cases.
   - `r` is initialized as an empty list to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, `n` is read as the number of constraints.
   - `cx` is initialized as an empty set to store the values that `k` must not be equal to (type 3 constraints).
   - `ax` is initialized to a large value (`1000000000.0 + 7`), representing the maximum possible value for `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - `bx` is initialized to a small value (`-1`), representing the minimum possible value for `k` (type 1 constraints).

3. **Reading Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the type `a` and the integer `x` are read.
   - If `a == 1`, update `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and `x` (to ensure `k` is at least `x`).
   - If `a == 2`, update `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and `x` (to ensure `k` is at most `x`).
   - If `a == 3`, add `x` to the set `cx` (to ensure `k` is not equal to `x`).

4. **Calculating the Result for Each Test Case**:
   - If `bx > ax`, it means there are no integers `k` that can satisfy all constraints, so the result for this test case is `0`.
   - Otherwise, iterate through the set `cx` and count how many of these values lie in the range `[bx, ax]`. Subtract this count from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` to get the number of valid `k` values.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the results are printed, each on a new line.

### Correctness:

The program correctly processes each test case by determining the valid range for `k` based on type 1 and type 2 constraints, then excluding the values specified by type 3 constraints. The logic correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid `k` values. The provided example inputs and outputs match the expected results based on the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
