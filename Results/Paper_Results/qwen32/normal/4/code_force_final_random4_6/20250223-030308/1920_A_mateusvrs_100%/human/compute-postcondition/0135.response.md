The code snippet `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ax` is the minimum of all `x` where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` where `a` is 3 and must contain at least one element, `r` remains the same as per its initial conditions, `n` is 0, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 1, and `i` is a value such that `bx <= i <= ax`.**
