The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. The initial state only specifies that `n` must be greater than 0, and this precondition is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `a` and `x` are integers read from the input.**
