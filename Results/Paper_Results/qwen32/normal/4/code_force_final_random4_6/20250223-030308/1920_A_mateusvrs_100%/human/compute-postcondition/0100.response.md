The code snippet provided sets the variable `cx` to an empty set. This means that all the unique values from the constraints of type 3, which were previously stored in `cx`, are now removed. The values of `ax`, `bx`, `r`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ax` is the smallest value from constraints of type 2, `bx` is the largest value from constraints of type 1, `cx` is an empty set, `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]` or `[0, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the conditions, `n` is an input integer.**
