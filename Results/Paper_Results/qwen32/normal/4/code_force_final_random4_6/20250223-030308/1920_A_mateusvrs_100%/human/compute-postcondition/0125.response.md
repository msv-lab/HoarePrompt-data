The given code snippet is `cx.add(x)`. This code modifies the set `cx` by adding the value `x` to it.

Let's analyze the initial state and the impact of the code:

- If `a` is 2, `cx` is an empty set initially, and after adding `x`, `cx` will be a set containing `x`.
- If `a` is not 2, `cx` initially contains `x`, and adding `x` again will not change `cx` because sets do not allow duplicate elements.

The other variables (`a`, `x`, `ax`, `bx`, `r`, `n`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state can be described as follows:

- If `a` is 2, `cx` becomes `{x}`.
- If `a` is not 2, `cx` remains `{x}`.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`. `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1. `cx` is `{x}`. `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]` or `[0, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the conditions. `n` is greater than 0.**
