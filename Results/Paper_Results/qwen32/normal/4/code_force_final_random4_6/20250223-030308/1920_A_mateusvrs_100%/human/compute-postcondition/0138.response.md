The code snippet `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. According to the initial state, `tmp` is either 0 or 1. Therefore, after the increment, `tmp` will be either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`ax` is the minimum of all `x` where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` where `a` is 3 and must contain at least one element, `r` remains the same as per its initial conditions, `n` is 0, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `i` is `i_next` where `i_next` is the next element in `cx`. If `bx <= i_next <= ax`, then `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0. After the code execution, `tmp` is either 1 or 2.**
