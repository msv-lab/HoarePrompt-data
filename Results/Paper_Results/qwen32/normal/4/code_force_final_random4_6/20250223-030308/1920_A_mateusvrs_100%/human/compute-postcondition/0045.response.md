The code snippet `tmp += 1` increments the value of the variable `tmp` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `tmp`, we can only state that `tmp` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, `cx` is a set of all `x` values encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2 such that `cx` must have at least one element, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `i` is the next element in `cx`. `tmp` is increased by 1.**
