Postcondition: **`ax` is the minimum of all `x` where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` where `a` is 3, `n` is 0, and `r` remains unchanged if `bx` is not greater than `ax`. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, `r` has an additional element 0 appended to it. Otherwise, `r` has an additional element equal to `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
