The code snippet `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and its previous value. Given the initial state, `bx` can either be `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, or `-1` otherwise. After executing the code, `bx` will be the larger of these two values.

Let's break it down:
- If `a` is 1, `bx` was initially `max(x, -1)`. After the update, `bx` remains `max(x, -1)` because `max(x, max(x, -1))` is `max(x, -1)`.
- If `a` is not 1, `bx` was initially `-1`. After the update, `bx` becomes `max(x, -1)`, which is `x` if `x` is greater than `-1`, otherwise `-1`.

The other variables (`a`, `x`, `ax`, `cx`, `r`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`. `bx` is `max(x, -1)`. `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`. `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]` or `[0, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the conditions. `n` is greater than 0.**
