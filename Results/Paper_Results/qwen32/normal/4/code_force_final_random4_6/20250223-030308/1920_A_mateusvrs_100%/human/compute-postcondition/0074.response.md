The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `x`. This means the values of `a` and `x` are updated based on the input, but the other variables (`n`, `bx`, `ax`, `cx`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than the current value of `_` + 1; `a` and `x` are integers read from the input; `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` remain unchanged.**
