Output State: **`a` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)` if `a` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ax` is `min(x, min(1000000007, x))`, `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`, `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]` or `[0, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the conditions, `n` is greater than 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ax` is updated to be the minimum of `x` and its previous value, which is `1000000007` if `a` is not equal to 2, or the minimum of `x` and `1000000007` if `a` is equal to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
