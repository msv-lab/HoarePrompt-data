The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is implicitly incremented by 1 (since it's a throwaway variable in the loop head), and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than the current value of `_`.

Since `_` is a throwaway variable, it doesn't have a specific name or value in the state, but we know it gets incremented by 1 in each iteration. So, if at the end of the previous iteration the loop was able to run, it means `_` was less than `n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will have been incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than this new value of `_`.

State: **`n` must be greater than the current value of `_` + 1; `a` and `x` are integers read from the input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and its previous value. If `a` is 2, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and its original value. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` includes the value of `x`.**
