The code snippet provided increments the value of `tmp` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ax` is the smallest value from constraints of type 2, `bx` is the largest value from constraints of type 1, `cx` is a set of all unique values from constraints of type 3 and must contain at least one element, `r` remains unchanged as `[0]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the initial conditions, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 1, and `i` is a value such that `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and `i` is less than or equal to `ax`.**
