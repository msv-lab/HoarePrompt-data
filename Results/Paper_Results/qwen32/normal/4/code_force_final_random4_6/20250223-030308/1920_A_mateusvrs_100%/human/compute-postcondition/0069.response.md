The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and its current value. Given the initial state, `ax` is updated based on the comparison between `x` and `ax`. The values of `n`, `a`, `x`, `bx`, and `cx` remain unchanged unless `a` is 2, which triggers the update of `ax`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` and `x` are integers read from the input; `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and its previous value if `a` is 1; `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and its original value if `a` is 2; `cx` includes the value of `x` if `a` is neither 1 nor 2; `ax` is the minimum of `x` and its original value.**
