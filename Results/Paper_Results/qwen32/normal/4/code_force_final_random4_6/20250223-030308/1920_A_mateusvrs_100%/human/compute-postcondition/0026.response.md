Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `x` is the second integer from the new input.**

Explanation: The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged. The conditions related to `a` and `x` are not evaluated or modified in this snippet, so they are not part of the output state.
