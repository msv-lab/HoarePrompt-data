Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem based on the given constraints and examples.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It then reads each constraint, which is a pair of integers `(a, x)`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `cx` is a set used to store all values `x` for constraints of type 3 (k must not be equal to x).
   - `ax` is initialized to a large value (`1000000000.0 + 7`), which is intended to represent the maximum possible value for constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x).
   - `bx` is initialized to -1, which is intended to represent the minimum possible value for constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x).

3. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint:
     - If `a == 1`, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`, ensuring `bx` captures the maximum lower bound.
     - If `a == 2`, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`, ensuring `ax` captures the minimum upper bound.
     - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` (the maximum lower bound) is greater than `ax` (the minimum upper bound). If so, it means there are no integers `k` that can satisfy all constraints, and it appends `0` to the result list `r`.

5. **Counting Valid k Values:**
   - If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by:
     - Calculating the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` as `ax - bx + 1`.
     - Subtracting the number of integers in this range that are in the set `cx` (i.e., the integers that `k` cannot be equal to).
   - It appends the result to the list `r`.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints all results in `r`, each on a new line.

### Validation Against Examples:

- **First Example:**
  - Constraints: `k >= 3`, `k <= 10`, `k != 1`, `k != 5`
  - Valid `k` values: `3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`
  - Program Output: `7` (Correct)

- **Second Example:**
  - Constraints: `k >= 5`, `k <= 4`
  - No valid `k` values
  - Program Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Other Examples:**
  - The program correctly handles other cases, including those with multiple constraints of type 3, and calculates the number of valid `k` values accurately.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints and handles all edge cases as per the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
