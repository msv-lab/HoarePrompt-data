Output State: **`ax` is the minimum of all `x` where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` where `a` is 3, `r` has an additional element 0 appended to it, `n` is 0, and `bx` is greater than `ax`.**

Explanation: The list `r` has an additional element `0` appended to it. The values of `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `n`, and the condition that `bx` is greater than `ax` remain unchanged.
