Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is greater than 0; `i` is 1; `d` is an input integer; `b` is the input string; `j` is the index of the first '*' in `b` or the length of `b` if no '*' is present; `s` is 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if b[:]:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is greater than 0; `i` is 1; `d` is an input integer; `b` is a non-empty string; `j` is the index of the first '*' in `b` or the length of `b` if no '*' is present. If `b[j]` is '@', then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is 0 and `b[j]` is not '@'. If `b[j]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `b` is not an empty string or if `b[j + 1]` is '*'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.', `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is `j + 1`. If `b[j]` is '@', then `s` is `s + 1`. If `b[j]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `b[j + 1]` is '*' or if the `if b[:]` condition is met. If `b[j]` is neither '@' nor '*', `s` is determined based on `b[j + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.', `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is 2. If `b[j]` is '@', `s` is its initial value plus 1. If `b[j]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `b[j]` is '*' and `b[j + 1]` is also '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
