To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the value of `s`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
- `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'.
- `a` is greater than 0.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `d` is an input integer.
- `b` is a non-empty string.
- `j` is the length of `b` or the index where the loop breaks due to a '*'.
- `s` is the count of '@' characters in `b` up to the point where the loop terminates.

### Key Points to Consider:
- The variable `s` is defined as the count of '@' characters in the string `b` up to the point where the loop terminates.
- The loop terminates either when it reaches the end of the string `b` or when it encounters a '*' character.
- Since `s` is the count of '@' characters up to the termination point, its value depends on the content of `b` and the position of any '*' character within it.

### Analysis:
- Without the specific content of `b`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `s`.
- However, we can describe `s` precisely in terms of the content of `b` and the loop termination condition.

### Conclusion:
The `print(s)` statement will output the count of '@' characters in the string `b` up to the point where the loop terminates, which is either the end of the string or the first occurrence of a '*' character.

Output: **s (where s is the count of '@' characters in the string `b` up to the point where the loop terminates)**
