The value of `s` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `s` is 1; `d` is an input integer; `b` is an input value that must have at least 1 element; `j` is 0; the current value of `b[j]` is '@'.
