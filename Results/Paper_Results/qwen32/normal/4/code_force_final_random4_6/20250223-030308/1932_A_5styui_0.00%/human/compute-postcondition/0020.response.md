Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `s` is 1 if `b[j]` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0; `d` is an input integer; `b` is an input value that must have at least 1 element; `j` is 1. If `b[j]` is '@', `s` is set to 1. If `b[j]` is not '@', `s` remains 0 and no other changes occur in the variables. If `b[j]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, but this does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `path`, `a`, `i`, `d`, `b`, or `j` in this context.

```
s = s + 1
```

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `s` is 2 if `b[j]` is '@', otherwise `s` is 1; `d` is an input integer; `b` is an input value that must have at least 1 element; `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `s` was initially 1 (which it would be if `b[j]` is '@'), it becomes 2. If `s` was initially 0 (which it would be if `b[j]` is not '@'), it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
