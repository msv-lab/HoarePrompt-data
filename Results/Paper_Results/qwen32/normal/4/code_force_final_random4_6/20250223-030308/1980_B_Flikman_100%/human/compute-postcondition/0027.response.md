Postcondition: **`t` is the integer input by the user and must be greater than 0; `n`, `f`, and `k` are the three integers input by the user; `a` is a list of integers provided by the user; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order; `removed_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`; `favorite_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, the condition holds as specified. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`, and if `removed_count` is 0, it remains 0; otherwise, `removed_count` is not equal to 0.**
