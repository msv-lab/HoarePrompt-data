The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, and `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged unless specified otherwise.

After executing the code, `n`, `f`, and `k` will be assigned the values read from the input. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user and must be greater than 0; `n`, `f`, and `k` are the three integers input by the user; `a` remains unchanged.**
