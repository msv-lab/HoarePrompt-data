The code snippet increments the variable `removed_count` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user and must be greater than 0; `n`, `f`, and `k` are the three integers input by the user, where `k` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers provided by the user; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order; If the current element of `sorted_a` at index `i` is equal to `favorite_value`, `removed_count` is 2. Otherwise, `removed_count` is 1; `i` is the current index + 1.**
