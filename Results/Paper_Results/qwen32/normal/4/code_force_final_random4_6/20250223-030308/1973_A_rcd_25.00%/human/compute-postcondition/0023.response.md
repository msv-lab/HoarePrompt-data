Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`. In both cases, `high` must be at least `cur`.**
