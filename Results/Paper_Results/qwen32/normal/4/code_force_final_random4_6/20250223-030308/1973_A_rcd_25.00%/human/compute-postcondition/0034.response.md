Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program continues without further action in the if block. Otherwise, the loop prints either `p1 - cur + p3` if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met for some `cur` between `low` and `high`, or `p3` if no such `cur` is found.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no other changes to the variables or the program flow, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
