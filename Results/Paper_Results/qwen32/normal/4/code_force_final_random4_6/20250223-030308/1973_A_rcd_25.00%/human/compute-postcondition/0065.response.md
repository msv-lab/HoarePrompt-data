The code assigns the value of `low` to `cur`. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 499; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is equal to `low`.**
