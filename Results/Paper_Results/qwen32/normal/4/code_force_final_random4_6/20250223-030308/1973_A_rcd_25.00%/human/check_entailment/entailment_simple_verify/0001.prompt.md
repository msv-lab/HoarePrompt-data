You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. Each of the following t lines contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, representing the scores of the three players in a non-decreasing order.

    #State: The loop has processed all `t` input cases, each consisting of three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. For each case, the program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1`. If the sum is even, the program checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. If true, it prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, it finds the largest possible value of `cur` such that `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` within the range defined by `low` and `high`, and prints `p1 - cur + p3`. If no such `cur` exists, it prints `p3`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the maximum number of draws given the scores of three players, p1, p2, and p3, where p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.
- Each game results in 2 points for a win, 1 point for each in a draw, and 0 points for a loss.
- The total points must be even because each game distributes 2 points in total.
- If the scores are inconsistent with any possible set of games, we should return -1.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Total Points Check:**
   - The program checks if the total points (p1 + p2 + p3) is even. If it's not, it prints -1 because it's impossible to distribute points in such a way that the total is odd.

3. **Score Analysis:**
   - If p3 (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (p1 + p2), it prints p1 + p2. This is because the highest scorer could have won all games against the other two, and the remaining points must have come from draws.
   - If p3 is less than p1 + p2, the program enters a loop to find the maximum possible number of draws:
     - It calculates `low` as the minimum of (p3 - p1) and (p3 - p2).
     - It calculates `high` as the maximum of (p3 - p1) and (p3 - p2).
     - It iterates from `low` to `high`, checking if the remaining points (after accounting for the games between the highest scorer and the others) can be distributed in a way that satisfies the scores.
     - If a valid distribution is found, it prints the total number of draws.
     - If no valid distribution is found after the loop, it prints p3.

### Correctness Check:
- The logic for checking the total points being even is correct.
- The logic for the case where p3 ≥ p1 + p2 is correct.
- The logic for the case where p3 < p1 + p2 is more complex, but the loop attempts to find a valid distribution of draws and wins that matches the scores.

### Testing with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `0 0 0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct, no games were played, so no draws)

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `0 1 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct, a single draw between the second and third player)

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - Output: `-1` (Correct, no valid distribution of points)

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `1 1 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct, one win and one draw for the third player)

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `3 3 3`
   - Output: `-1` (Correct, no valid distribution of points)

6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: `3 4 5`
   - Output: `6` (Correct, a specific distribution of wins and draws)

7. **Example 7:**
   - Input: `1 1 10`
   - Output: `2` (Correct, a specific distribution of wins and draws)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the provided examples and adheres to the logic necessary to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
