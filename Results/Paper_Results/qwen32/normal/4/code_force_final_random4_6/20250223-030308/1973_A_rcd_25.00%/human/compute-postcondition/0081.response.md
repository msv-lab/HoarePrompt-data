The code snippet `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `cur` must be at least `low` and the relationship between `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `cur` are still valid but with the updated value of `cur`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 499; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` must be at least `cur`; `cur` is incremented by 1.**
