To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `high` and `cur`.

The loop condition is `high >= cur`. This means that for the loop to execute again, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 499.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` remains equal to `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is set to `low + 1`.

The only variables we can adjust to ensure the loop executes one more time are `high` and `cur`.

### Analysis:
1. **High and Cur Relationship:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `high >= cur`.
   - If `cur` is currently set to `low` or `low + 1`, then `high` must be at least `cur` for the loop to continue.

2. **Adjustment:**
   - If `cur` is `low`, `high` must be at least `low`.
   - If `cur` is `low + 1`, `high` must be at least `low + 1`.

### Conclusion:
- `high` should be adjusted to be at least `cur` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 499; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and `high` must be at least `cur`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` remains equal to `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is set to `low + 1`.**

However, since we only need to adjust `high` to ensure the loop condition holds, we can simplify it to:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 499; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` must be at least `cur`. `cur` is set according to the condition: if `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` remains equal to `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is set to `low + 1`.**
