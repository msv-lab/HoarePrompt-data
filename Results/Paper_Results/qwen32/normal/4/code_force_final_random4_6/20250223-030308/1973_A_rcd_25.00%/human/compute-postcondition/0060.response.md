The `print(-1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`. It simply prints the integer `-1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print(-1)` statement explicitly prints the integer `-1`.

Since there are no variables or conditions affecting the output of this specific `print` statement, the output is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
