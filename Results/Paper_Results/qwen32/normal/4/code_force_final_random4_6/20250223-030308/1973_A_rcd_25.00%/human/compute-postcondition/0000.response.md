Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. Each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, representing the scores of the three players in a non-decreasing order.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is now assigned the value of the integer input by the user, and it remains within the range of 1 to 500. The conditions and descriptions of the scores `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` for each of the `t` lines remain unchanged.
