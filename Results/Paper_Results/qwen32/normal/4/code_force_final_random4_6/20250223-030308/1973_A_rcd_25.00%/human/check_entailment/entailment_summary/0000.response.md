Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to solve the problem by first checking if the total points (p1 + p2 + p3) are even. This is necessary because every game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2-0 or 1-1). If the total points are odd, it's impossible to achieve this distribution, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.

The next step is to determine the maximum number of draws. If the highest score (p3) is at least as large as the sum of the other two scores (p1 + p2), it means that the player with the highest score could have won all the games against the other two players, and the remaining points (p1 + p2) must have come from draws. In this case, the program correctly outputs `p1 + p2`.

If p3 is less than p1 + p2, the program calculates the possible number of draws by iterating through possible values. It uses the fact that the number of draws is maximized when the difference between the highest score and each of the other two scores is minimized. The program checks if the remaining points (after accounting for the wins of the highest-scoring player) can be distributed between the other two players in a way that respects their scores.

The logic used to determine the maximum number of draws appears to be correct. The program tries to find the largest number of draws such that the remaining points can be distributed in a valid manner. If no valid distribution is found, it defaults to printing `p3`, which is the highest possible number of draws in some scenarios.

The provided execution summary aligns with the program's logic and output for the given examples. The program handles various edge cases, including scenarios with no games played, scenarios with only draws, and scenarios where one player has a significantly higher score than the others.

Correctness: **True**
