Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` remains `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is set to `low + 1`.**
