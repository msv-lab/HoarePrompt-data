The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the nearest enclosing loop or `if` statement. Given the initial state, none of the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, or `cur` are modified by the `break` statement.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `cur` is equal to `low`. Additionally, `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
