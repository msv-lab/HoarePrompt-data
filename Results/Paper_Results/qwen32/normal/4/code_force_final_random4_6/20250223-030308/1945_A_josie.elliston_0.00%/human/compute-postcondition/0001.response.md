Output State: **The program returns -1 if `ret` is None; otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.**

This means that if the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)` is `None`, the program will return `-1`. If `ret` has a value other than `None`, the program will return the sum of `introverts` and that value.
