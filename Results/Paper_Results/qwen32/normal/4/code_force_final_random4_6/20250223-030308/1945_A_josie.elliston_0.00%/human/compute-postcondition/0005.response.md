Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state:

Initial State: 
- `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers.
- If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, the sum of the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 and the value of `universals` is 3 or more.
- Otherwise, there is no change to the values of `extroverts` and `universals`.

The code snippet:
```python
return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
```

We need to consider two scenarios based on the divisibility of `extroverts` by 3:

1. If `extroverts` is divisible by 3, the sum of the remainder (which is 0) and `universals` doesn't need to be considered for the condition, and we simply calculate `(extroverts + universals) / 3` and take the ceiling of the result.
2. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, the sum of the remainder (which is a value between 1 and 2) and `universals` is 3 or more. This condition ensures that the result of `(extroverts + universals) / 3` will be at least 1 when rounded up.

Given these conditions, the return value will be the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.

Output State: **The program returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.**
