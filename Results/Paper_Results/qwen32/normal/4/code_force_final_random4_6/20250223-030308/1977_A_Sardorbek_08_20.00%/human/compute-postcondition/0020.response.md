Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `b` is the first new input integer.
- `c` is the second new input integer.
- `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It prints the string `'YES'` directly. The values of `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, and `q` do not influence the output of this specific print statement because the string `'YES'` is explicitly provided.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
