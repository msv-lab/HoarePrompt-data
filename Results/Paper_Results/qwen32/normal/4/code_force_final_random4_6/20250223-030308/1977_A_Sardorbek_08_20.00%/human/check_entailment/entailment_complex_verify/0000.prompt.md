You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100), where n is the number of moves Nikita can make, and m is the desired number of cubes in the tower after those moves.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `i` is equal to `a`, and `b`, `c`, and `q` hold the values from the last test case. The values of `a` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`. It determines for each test case whether it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes in a tower using `n` moves, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether it's possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of `m` cubes after `n` moves. Let's analyze the logic and find the issues:

1. **Condition `if b == c:`**:
   - This condition checks if the number of moves `b` is equal to the number of cubes `c`. If they are equal, it prints "YES". This is correct because if the number of moves is equal to the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
   
2. **Condition `elif b < c:`**:
   - This condition checks if the number of moves `b` is less than the number of cubes `c`. If so, it prints "NO". This is correct because if there are fewer moves than cubes, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes.
   
3. **Condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:`**:
   - This condition is incorrect. The variable `a` here is the number of test cases, not the number of moves. The correct condition should check if the number of moves `b` and the number of cubes `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd). If they do, it means Nikita can achieve `m` cubes because he can add and remove cubes in pairs to reach the desired number of cubes.
   
4. **Condition `else:`**:
   - This condition handles all other cases, printing "No". This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the correct parity condition.

### Correct Condition:
The correct condition should be:
- If `b >= c` and `b % 2 == c % 2`, then print "YES".
- Otherwise, print "NO".

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b >= c and b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Example Case Where Original Code Fails:
Input:
```
2
4 2
3 1
```
Expected Output:
```
YES
YES
```
Actual Output (from original code):
```
NO
NO
```
Explanation:
- For `b = 4` and `c = 2`: Since `4 >= 2` and `4 % 2 == 2 % 2`, the output should be "YES".
- For `b = 3` and `c = 1`: Since `3 >= 1` and `3 % 2 == 1 % 2`, the output should be "YES".

Thus, the original code is incorrect.
