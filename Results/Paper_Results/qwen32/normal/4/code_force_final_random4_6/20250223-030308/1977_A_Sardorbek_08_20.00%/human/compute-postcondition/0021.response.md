The `print('NO')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, or `q`. It simply prints the string 'NO'.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `a` is described as being greater than or equal to 1.
2. The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1.
3. The variables `b` and `c` are defined as the first and second new input integers, respectively.
4. The variable `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print('NO')` statement. The statement directly prints the string 'NO' without referencing any of the variables.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
