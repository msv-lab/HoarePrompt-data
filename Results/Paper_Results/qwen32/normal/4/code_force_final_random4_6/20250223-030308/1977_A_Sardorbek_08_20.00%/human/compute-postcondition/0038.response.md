Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`. `n` represents the number of moves Nikita can make, and `m` is the desired number of cubes in the tower after those moves. For each test case, the function returns a result indicating whether it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes in the tower with `n` moves.**
