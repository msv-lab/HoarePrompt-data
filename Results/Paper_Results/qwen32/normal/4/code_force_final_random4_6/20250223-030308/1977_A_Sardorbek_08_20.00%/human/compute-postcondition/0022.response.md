The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes several variables (`a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, `q`) and their relationships, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` function.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `a` is described as being greater than or equal to 1, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
2. The variable `i` is set to 1, but it is also not used in the `print` statement.
3. The variables `b` and `c` are described as the first and second new input integers, respectively, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
4. The variable `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
5. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Since none of the variables affect the `print` statement, the output is simply the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
