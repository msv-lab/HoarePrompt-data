You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100), where n is the number of moves Nikita can make, and m is the desired number of cubes in the tower after those moves.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `i` is equal to `a`, and `b`, `c`, and `q` hold the values from the last test case. The values of `a` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`. It determines for each test case whether it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes in a tower using `n` moves, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The problem requires us to determine if, given `n` moves and a desired number of cubes `m` in the tower, it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes in the tower. In each move, we can either add or remove exactly one cube from the tower. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Conditions**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Moves**: Each move can either increase or decrease the number of cubes by 1.
3. **Final Condition**: After `n` moves, the tower should have exactly `m` cubes.

From this, we can derive the following:
- If `m` is greater than `n`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes because we can only add a maximum of `n` cubes.
- If `m` is less than 0, it is impossible to have `m` cubes because we can only remove a maximum of `n` cubes, starting from 0.
- The parity (odd or even nature) of the final number of cubes `m` should match the parity of the number of moves `n` because each move changes the parity of the number of cubes. For example, if we start with 0 cubes (even), after an odd number of moves, we will have an odd number of cubes, and after an even number of moves, we will have an even number of cubes.

Now let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly implements the above logic:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line is unnecessary and does not affect the logic.
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

- The first `if` statement checks if `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (desired number of cubes). If they are equal, it prints 'YES'. This is correct only when `n` is equal to `m` and `n` is even (since we start from 0 cubes, an even number).
- The second `elif` statement checks if `b` is less than `c`. If true, it prints 'NO'. This is incorrect because it should check if `c` is greater than `b` (more cubes than moves is impossible).
- The third `elif` statement checks the parity of `a` (number of test cases) and `b` (number of moves). This is incorrect because it should check the parity of `b` and `c`.
- The `else` statement prints 'No' which is not always correct.

The correct logic should be:
- If `m` is greater than `n`, print 'NO'.
- If `m` is less than 0, print 'NO'.
- If the parity of `n` and `m` match, print 'YES'.
- Otherwise, print 'NO'.

The provided code does not correctly implement the above logic. Specifically, it incorrectly checks the parity against the number of test cases `a` instead of the number of moves `b`.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
