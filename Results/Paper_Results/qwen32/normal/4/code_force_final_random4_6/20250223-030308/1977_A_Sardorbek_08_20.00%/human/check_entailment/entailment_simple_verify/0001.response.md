### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis

Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. The goal is to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, starting from zero cubes.

Key points:
1. **Parity Check**: The parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes after `n` moves must match the parity of `n` because each move changes the parity.
2. **Range Check**: The number of cubes `m` must be within the range `[0, n]` because the maximum number of cubes we can have is `n` (all moves are additions) and the minimum number of cubes is `0` (all moves are removals, starting from 0).

#### Provided Code Analysis

Here is the provided code with annotations:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())  # Read the number of moves (b) and desired cubes (c)
        q = (b, c)  # This line is unnecessary and does not affect the logic.
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

Let's break down the logic:
1. **First Condition (`if b == c`)**: This checks if the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes. This is only correct if `b` (moves) is even and `c` (desired cubes) equals `b` because starting from 0, an even number of moves can result in an even number of cubes equal to the number of moves.
2. **Second Condition (`elif b < c`)**: This checks if the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes. This is incorrect because the correct check should be if `c` (desired cubes) is greater than `b` (moves), which is impossible since we can't have more cubes than moves.
3. **Third Condition (`elif a % 2 == b % 2`)**: This checks if the parity of the number of test cases `a` matches the parity of the number of moves `b`. This is incorrect because it should check if the parity of `b` (moves) matches the parity of `c` (desired cubes).
4. **Fourth Condition (`else`)**: This prints 'No' which is not always correct.

#### Correct Logic

The correct logic should be:
1. **Range Check**: If `m > n` or `m < 0`, print 'NO'.
2. **Parity Check**: If the parity of `n` matches the parity of `m`, print 'YES'. Otherwise, print 'NO'.

#### Conclusion

The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic. Specifically:
- It incorrectly checks the parity against the number of test cases `a` instead of the number of moves `b`.
- It incorrectly handles the range check for `m` and `n`.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
