#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2`, along with two lists of distinct integers `L` and `R` in increasing order. It checks specific conditions and returns 0 if any of these conditions are met. If none of the conditions are met, it calculates and returns a value `ans` based on combinatorial logic.
