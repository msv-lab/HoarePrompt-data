### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine if the program is correct.

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `N`, `M1`, and `M2`, and two lists `L` and `R`.

2. **Validation Checks:**
   - The program first checks if the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. If not, it returns 0 because the maximum prefix and suffix cannot overlap at different positions.
   - It then checks if the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`. If not, it returns 0 because the smallest element should be the first prefix maximum and the largest element should be the first suffix maximum.
   - It also checks if both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1 and if the second last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If this condition holds, it returns 0 because it implies an invalid configuration where the second largest prefix maximum and the second largest suffix maximum overlap inappropriately.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation:**
   - If the above conditions are not violated, the program calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial logic.
   - It first calculates the binomial coefficient `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` which represents the number of ways to choose `L[-1] - 1` elements from the remaining `N - 1` elements to place before the last prefix maximum.
   - It then iterates from the second last element of `L` to the second element of `L`, multiplying the current answer by the number of available slots for each prefix maximum, adjusting the count of available slots accordingly.
   - Similarly, it iterates from the second element of `R` to the second last element of `R`, multiplying the current answer by the number of available slots for each suffix maximum, adjusting the count of available slots accordingly.

4. **Output:**
   - The final result is the number of valid permutations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Issues in the Code:
- The code has a logical error in the final loop for `M2`. The loop iterates from `R[0] + 1` to `N`, but it should iterate from `R[1]` to `N - 1` if `M2 > 1`. The current implementation incorrectly sets `nums_left` to `N - R[0] - 1` and then starts the loop from `R[0] + 1`, which is incorrect because `R[0]` is already fixed as `N`.
- The loop for `M2` should also correctly update the `cur` variable and `nums_left` variable similarly to the loop for `M1`.

### Corrected Loop for `M2`:
```python
if (M2 > 1) :
    cur = 1
    nums_left = N - R[1]  # Corrected to start from the second element of R
    i = R[1] + 1
    while i < N:
        if i == R[cur]:
            cur += 1
        else:
            ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
        
        nums_left -= 1
        
        i += 1
```

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, the program is currently incorrect due to the flawed loop for `M2`. The corrected loop should be implemented to ensure the program calculates the number of valid permutations accurately.

Correctness: **False**
