The code provided reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `L`. The initial state describes `t`, `n`, `m_1`, `m_2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}`, and `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` as given, but these are not directly affected by the execution of the provided code snippet. The only variable that is changed is `L`, which is assigned the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= p_i <= n. `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= s_i <= n. `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input. `L` is a list of integers read from the input.**
