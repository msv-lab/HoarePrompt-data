To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the loop and its behavior step-by-step.

The loop starts with:
- `cur` initialized to `M1 - 2`
- `nums_left` initialized to `L[-1] - 2`
- `i` initialized to `L[-1] - 1`

The loop runs as long as `i > 1`. In each iteration, the loop either decrements `cur` if `i` matches `L[cur]`, or it multiplies `ans` by `nums_left` and then takes modulo `MOD`. The value of `nums_left` is decremented by 1 in every iteration, and `i` is also decremented by 1 in every iteration.

The loop will terminate when `i` becomes 2. At this point, we need to consider the state of `cur` and `nums_left`.

The final output state will be:
- `cur` will be decremented each time `i` matches an element in `L` starting from `L[cur]` down to `L[1]` (if any such elements exist).
- `nums_left` will be decremented by 1 in each iteration, so it will be `L[-1] - i - 1` when the loop terminates.
- `i` will be 2 when the loop terminates.
- `ans` will have been updated according to the conditions specified in the loop.

Given that the loop terminates when `i` is 2, the final state of `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - 3` (since it starts at `L[-1] - 2` and is decremented `L[-1] - 3` times).

The final state of `cur` depends on how many times `i` matched an element in `L` during the loop's execution. If `i` matched `L[cur]` in the last iteration where `i` was 3, then `cur` will be `M1 - 3`. Otherwise, `cur` will be `M1 - 2`.

The final value of `ans` will be the product of all `nums_left` values encountered during the loop, taken modulo `MOD`.

Thus, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`cur` is `M1 - 3` if `L[-1] - 3` was in `L` during the loop, otherwise `cur` is `M1 - 2`; `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`; `i` is `2`; `ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values encountered during the loop, taken modulo `MOD`.**

In simpler terms, the loop continues until `i` reaches 2, updating `ans` and `nums_left` as it goes. The final state depends on whether `L[-1] - 3` was one of the values in `L` during the loop, which would decrement `cur` one last time.
