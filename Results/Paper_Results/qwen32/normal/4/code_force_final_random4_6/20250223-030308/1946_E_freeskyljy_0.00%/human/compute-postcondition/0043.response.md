To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement. The loop condition is `i < N`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `i` is `N + 1`
- `N` is assigned the value from the input (and `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5)

Since `i` is currently `N + 1`, the condition `i < N` will be false, and the loop will not execute. To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust `i` so that `i < N`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Condition**: The only variable in the loop condition `i < N` is `i`.
2. **Adjust `i`**: To make the condition true, `i` must be less than `N`. Since `i` is currently `N + 1`, we need to change `i` to a value less than `N`. The simplest adjustment is to set `i` to `N - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` should be `N - 1` instead of `N + 1`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged because they do not affect the loop condition `i < N`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; The sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= p_i <= n; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= s_i <= n; `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input; The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`; Additionally, `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`; At least one of the following conditions is true: `M1` is not greater than 1, `M2` is not greater than 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`; `nums_left` is -1; and `M2` is greater than 1; `cur` is 1; `i` is `N - 1`**
