For the given `while` loop to execute at least once, the condition `i > 1` must be true. This means that the variable `i` must be greater than 1 right before the loop starts.

Let's analyze the given state and identify which variables can be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= p_i <= n.
- `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= s_i <= n.
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input.
- `L` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `R` is a list of integers read from the input.
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`.
- Additionally, `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`.
- At least one of the following conditions is true: `M1` is not greater than 1, `M2` is not greater than 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`.
- `ans` is the binomial coefficient `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
- `M1` is greater than 1.
- `cur` is `M1 - 2`.
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`.
- `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.

The only variable in the loop head is `i`. To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `i` must be greater than 1. Right before the loop, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`. Therefore, `L[-1] - 1` must be greater than 1, which means `L[-1]` must be greater than 2.

No other variables need to be adjusted since the loop condition only involves `i`.
