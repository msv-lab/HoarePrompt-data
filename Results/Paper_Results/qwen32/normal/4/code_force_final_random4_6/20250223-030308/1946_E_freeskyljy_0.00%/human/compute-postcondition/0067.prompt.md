You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2`, along with two lists of distinct integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` and `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` in increasing order. For each test case, the function evaluates certain conditions and returns 0 in three specific cases. If none of these cases are met, it returns a value `ans`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns 0.

Case_3: The program returns 0

Case_4: The program returns `ans`
