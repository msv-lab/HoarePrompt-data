The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer and provides constraints for `n`, `m_1`, `m_2`, `p_i`, and `s_i` for each test case. Since the code only reads the first three values for a test case, the values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= p_i <= n. `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= s_i <= n. `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input.**
