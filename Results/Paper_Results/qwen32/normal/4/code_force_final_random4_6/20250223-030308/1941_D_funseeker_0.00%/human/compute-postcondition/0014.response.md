The code snippet `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds a new element to the set `temp`. Given the initial state, we know that `temp` already contains the tuple `((q + r) % n)` and potentially `((q - r) % n)`. After executing the code, `temp` will definitely include the element `((q + r) % n)`, and if it was not already present, it will be added.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the values `x` and potentially other values, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the tuples `((q + r) % n)` and `((q - r) % n)`, otherwise `temp` remains an empty set. `q` is the next element in the set `ans` that hasn't been processed yet. `temp` now definitely contains the element `((q + r) % n)` and potentially `((q - r) % n)` if it was not already present.**
