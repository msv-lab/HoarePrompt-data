Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of players, where 2 <= n <= 1000), `m` (the number of throws, where 1 <= m <= 1000), and `x` (the starting player, where 1 <= x <= n). The function returns the player number who will end up with the item after `m` throws, given that the throws are passed in a circular manner starting from player `x`.**
