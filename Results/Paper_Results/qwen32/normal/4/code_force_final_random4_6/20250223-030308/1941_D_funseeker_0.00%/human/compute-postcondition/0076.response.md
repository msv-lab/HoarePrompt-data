To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, we need to break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **Function Calls and Variable Assignments:**
   - `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. Since we don't have the definition of `func_3()`, we don't know the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `x`. However, we know they are specific values returned by this function.
   
2. **Set `ans` Generation:**
   - `ans` is a set that is generated through a series of operations on `x` for `m` iterations. The exact operations are not specified, so we can't determine the exact elements of `ans`. However, we know `ans` is a set, which means it will contain unique values only.
   
3. **Condition and Modification of `ans`:**
   - If `0` is in `ans`, no additional changes are made to `ans`.
   - If `0` is not in `ans`, then `n` is added to `ans`.

### Analysis

- **Set `ans` Length:**
  - The length of `ans` depends on the operations performed on `x` for `m` iterations and whether `0` is already in `ans`.
  - After the operations, if `0` is not in `ans`, `n` is added, increasing the length of `ans` by 1.

### Output Determination

Since the exact operations and values are not specified, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `len(ans)`. However, we can provide a precise description based on the given conditions:

- If `0` is not in the set `ans` after the operations, `n` is added, and the length of `ans` increases by 1.
- If `0` is in the set `ans`, no additional elements are added, and the length remains the same.

### Final Output

Given the information provided, the most precise description of what will be printed is:

Output: **len(ans) (where len(ans) is the number of unique elements in the set `ans` after the operations, possibly increased by 1 if `0` was not initially in `ans`)**
