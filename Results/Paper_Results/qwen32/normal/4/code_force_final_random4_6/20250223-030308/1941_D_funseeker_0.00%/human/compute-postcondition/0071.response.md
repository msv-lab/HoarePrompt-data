To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the set `ans` evolves with each iteration. The loop runs `m` times, and in each iteration, the set `ans` is updated based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1()`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
   - `ans` is a set containing the value `x`.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each iteration, `r` and `c` are obtained from `func_1()`.
   - A temporary set `temp` is created.
   - For each element `q` in `ans`:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', `(q + r) % n` is added to `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', `(q - r) % n` is added to `temp`.
   - After processing all elements in `ans`, `ans` is updated to be `temp`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After `m` iterations, `ans` will contain all possible values that can be reached from the initial value `x` by performing the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` as dictated by the values of `c` in each iteration.

Given the nature of the operations and the fact that `ans` is updated iteratively, the final state will be:

- `n`, `m`, and `x` remain the same as they were initially.
- `ans` will be a set containing all the values that can be generated from `x` through the specified operations for `m` iterations.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `ans` is a set containing all values generated from `x` through the specified operations for `m` iterations.**

In simpler terms, `ans` will contain all possible results of adding and subtracting the `r` values (modulo `n`) from the initial value `x` based on the conditions specified by `c` for each of the `m` iterations.
