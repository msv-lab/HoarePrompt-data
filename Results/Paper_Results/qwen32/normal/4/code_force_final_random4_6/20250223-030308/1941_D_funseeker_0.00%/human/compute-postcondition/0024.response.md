The code snippet `ans = temp` assigns the value of `temp` to `ans`. Given that `temp` is an empty set, `ans` will also become an empty set. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is an empty set, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`.**
