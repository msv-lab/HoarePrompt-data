The code snippet adds the value of `n` to the set `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` is a set containing values generated from `x` through specified operations for `m` iterations, and `0` is not an element of `ans`. The only change here is that `n` is added to this set.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `ans` is a set containing all values generated from `x` through the specified operations for `m` iterations, `0` is not an element of `ans`, and `n` has been added to `ans`.**
