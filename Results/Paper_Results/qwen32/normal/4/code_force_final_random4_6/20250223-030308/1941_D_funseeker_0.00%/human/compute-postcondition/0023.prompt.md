Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the value `x`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the value `x`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the tuples `((q + r) % n)` and `((q - r) % n)`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the values `x` and potentially other values, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. `q` is the next element in the set `ans` that hasn't been processed yet. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the elements `((q + r) % n)` and `((q - r) % n)`. If `c` is '0', `temp` contains the elements `((q + r) % n)` and `((q - r) % n)`. If `c` is neither '0' nor '1' nor '?', `temp` remains an empty set.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the values `x` and potentially other values, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. `q` is the next element in the set `ans` that hasn't been processed yet. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the element `((q - r) % n)` and potentially other elements based on the value of `c`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
