The code snippet `r, c = func_1().split()` splits the string returned by `func_1()` into two parts and assigns them to `r` and `c`. Since `r` was previously the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()` and `c` was the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, executing this line of code will not change the values of `r` and `c` because they are already assigned based on the split result of `func_1()`.

The other variables `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans` remain unchanged by this code snippet. `n` and `m` are one less than their previous values, `x` holds the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is an empty set, and `m` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`n`, `m` is one less than the previous value, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is an empty set, `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`**
