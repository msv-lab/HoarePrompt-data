To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `ans` is a set that contains all values generated from `x` through a series of operations for `m` iterations.
- If `0` is in `ans`, no additional changes are made.
- If `0` is not in `ans`, `n` is added to `ans`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*ans)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Values of `n`, `m`, and `x`**:
   - These values are determined by the function `func_3()`. Since the function `func_3()` is not provided, we cannot know the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `x`. However, we can represent them symbolically as `n`, `m`, and `x`.

2. **Set `ans`**:
   - `ans` is generated through a series of operations on `x` for `m` iterations. The exact nature of these operations is not provided, so we can't determine the exact elements of `ans`.
   - The only condition given is that if `0` is in `ans`, no additional changes are made. If `0` is not in `ans`, then `n` is added to `ans`.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: `0` is in `ans`.
  - In this case, no additional changes are made to `ans`.
  - The output will be the elements of `ans` as they are.
- **Scenario 2**: `0` is not in `ans`.
  - In this case, `n` is added to `ans`.
  - The output will be the elements of `ans` including `n`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are not provided, and the operations to generate `ans` are not detailed, we can only describe the output in terms of `ans` and `n`.

**Output Description**:
- If `0` is in `ans`, the output will be the elements of `ans`.
- If `0` is not in `ans`, the output will be the elements of `ans` with `n` added to it.

Given this, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **elements of `ans` (where `ans` is a set containing all values generated from `x` through the specified operations for `m` iterations, and `n` is added to `ans` if `0` is not in `ans`)**
