To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the `ans` and `temp` sets.

### Analysis of the Loop:
- **Initialization**: 
  - `ans` starts as a set containing the initial value `x`.
  - `temp` starts as an empty set.
- **Loop Execution**:
  - The loop iterates over each element `q` in `ans`.
  - Depending on the value of `c`:
    - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
    - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
  - After processing each `q`, `temp` will contain new values that are added to `ans`.

### Key Points:
1. **Set Expansion**: Each element `q` in `ans` can potentially generate new elements that are added back to `ans` in the next iteration.
2. **Termination**: The loop terminates when there are no new elements to process in `ans`.

### Final Output State:
- **`ans`**: This set will contain all unique values generated by the loop until no new values can be added.
- **`temp`**: This set will be empty at the end of the loop since it is cleared and repopulated in each iteration.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations, `ans` will contain all unique values generated by the loop, and `temp` will be empty.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing all unique values generated by the loop, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. `temp` is an empty set.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes executing, `ans` will contain all unique values that were generated by adding or subtracting `r` from each element in `ans` and taking the result modulo `n`, based on the value of `c`. The `temp` set will be empty because it is cleared and repopulated in each iteration of the loop.
