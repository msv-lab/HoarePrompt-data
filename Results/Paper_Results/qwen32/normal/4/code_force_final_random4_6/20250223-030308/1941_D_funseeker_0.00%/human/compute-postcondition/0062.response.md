The code snippet adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. 

Given the initial state, `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?'. Since the code snippet specifically adds `(q - r) % n` to `temp`, `temp` will definitely contain `(q - r) % n` after the execution.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, `_`, `q`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0; `ans` is a set containing at least one element; `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()` as an integer; `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`; `_` is incremented by 1; `q` is the next element in the set `ans` after the current one; `temp` is a set containing `(q - r) % n` and possibly `(q + r) % n` depending on the value of `c`.**
