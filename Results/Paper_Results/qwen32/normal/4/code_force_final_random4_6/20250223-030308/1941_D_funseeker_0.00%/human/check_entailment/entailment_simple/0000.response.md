### Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's functionality and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`, which reads an integer from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`, which reads a line of input, splits it, and converts each part to an integer.
   - For each of the `m` throws, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c` using `func_1()`, which reads a line of input and splits it into two parts: the integer `r` and the character `c`.

2. **Processing Throws:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` with the possible positions the ball could be in after the throw, considering the direction `c`:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp` (clockwise move).
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp` (counterclockwise move).
   - After processing each throw, `ans` is updated to the new set `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program ensures that if `0` is in `ans`, it is replaced with `n` to account for the circular nature of the players.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of unique players who could have the ball after `m` throws.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.

### Correctness:

The program correctly handles all the specified cases and edge conditions, including:
- The circular nature of the players.
- The possibility of the ball being thrown in either direction when the direction is unknown.
- The correct updating and handling of the set of possible positions.

Thus, based on the provided reasoning and the alignment with the problem requirements, the program is correct.

### Response:

Correctness: **True**
