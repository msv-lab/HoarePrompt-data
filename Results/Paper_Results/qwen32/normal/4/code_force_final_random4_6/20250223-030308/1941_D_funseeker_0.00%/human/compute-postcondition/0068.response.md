Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0; `ans` is a set containing at least one element; `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()` as an integer; `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`; `_` is incremented by 1; `q` is the next element in the set `ans` after the current one; `temp` is a set containing `(q - r) % n` and `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?'. Otherwise, `temp` contains only `(q - r) % n`. Since the else part is not specified, the behavior described in the if part is the only one that applies.**
