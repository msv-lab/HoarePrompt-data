The code snippet `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `m`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0.
- `ans` is a set containing at least one element.
- `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()` as an integer.
- `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `q` is the next element in the set `ans` after the current one.
- `temp` is a set containing `(q - r) % n` and `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?'. Otherwise, `temp` contains only `(q - r) % n`.

The code snippet will add `(q - r) % n` to `temp`. Since `temp` already contains `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', or only `(q - r) % n` if `c` is anything else, adding `(q - r) % n` again will not change the set `temp` because sets do not allow duplicate elements.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state for `temp` in terms of its contents.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0; `ans` is a set containing at least one element; `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()` as an integer; `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`; `_` is incremented by 1; `q` is the next element in the set `ans` after the current one; `temp` is a set containing `(q - r) % n` and `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?'. Otherwise, `temp` contains only `(q - r) % n`.**
