The given code snippet adds a new value to the set `temp`. Specifically, it adds the value `(q + r) % n` to `temp`. Since `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n` and possibly `(q - r) % n` (if `c` is '1' or '?'), adding `(q + r) % n` again does not change the set as sets do not allow duplicate values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0. `ans` is a set containing at least two elements. `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` and, if `c` is '1' or '?', also contains the value `(q - r) % n`. `q` is the next element in the set `ans`.**
