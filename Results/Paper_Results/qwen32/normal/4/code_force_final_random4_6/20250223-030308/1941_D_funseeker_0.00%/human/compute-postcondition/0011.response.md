The code adds a new element to the set `temp`. The new element is calculated as `(q - r) % n`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the value `x`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?', and `temp` is a set containing the tuples `((q + r) % n)` and `((q - r) % n)`**.
