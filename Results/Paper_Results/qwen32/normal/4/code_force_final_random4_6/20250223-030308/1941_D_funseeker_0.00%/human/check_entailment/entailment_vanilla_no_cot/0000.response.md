Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Reading**:
    - The program reads input using custom functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`).
    - `func_1` reads a line of input.
    - `func_2` reads a single integer.
    - `func_3` reads a line of input and converts it to a list of integers.
    - `func_4` processes each test case. It reads `n`, `m`, and `x` and initializes the set `ans` with `x`.

2. **Processing Each Throw**:
    - For each throw (reading `r` and `c`), it calculates the possible new positions based on the direction (`c`).
    - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
    - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
    - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.

3. **Handling the Modulo Operation**:
    - The program uses `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` to determine the new positions.
    - The modulo operation ensures that the positions wrap around the circle correctly.
    - The program also handles the case where the result of `(q - r) % n` might be zero by checking for `0` and converting it to `n`.

4. **Output**:
    - After processing all throws, the program prints the number of possible positions and the positions themselves in increasing order.

### Correctness of the Program:

- The program correctly processes each throw and calculates the possible positions based on the given direction.
- It uses a set to keep track of all possible positions, ensuring that each position is unique.
- The modulo operation is correctly applied to handle the circular nature of the problem.
- The conversion from `0` to `n` is correctly handled to ensure that positions are within the valid range `[1, n]`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output based on the input.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
