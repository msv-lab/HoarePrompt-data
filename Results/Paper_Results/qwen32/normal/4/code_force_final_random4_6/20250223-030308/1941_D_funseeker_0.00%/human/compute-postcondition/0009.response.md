Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the value `x`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the tuple `((q + r) % n)`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.**
