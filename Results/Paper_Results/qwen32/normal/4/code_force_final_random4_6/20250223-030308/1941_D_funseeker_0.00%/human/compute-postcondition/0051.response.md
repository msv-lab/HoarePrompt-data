The code snippet provided simply initializes a new set named `temp`. This operation does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, `_`). Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0; `ans` is a set containing all the values `(q + r) % n` and, if `c` is '1' or '?', also contains the value `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`; `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()` as an integer; `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `_` is incremented by 1; `temp` is an empty set.**
