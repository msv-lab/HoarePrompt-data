To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the functions `func_10()` and `func_15()`.

From the information provided:
- The loop runs for `func_10()` iterations.
- In each iteration, `func_15()` is called, and its return value is printed.

Given the output states for the first 3 iterations, we can infer that:
- The loop runs at least as many times as the value returned by `func_10()`.
- After each iteration, a positive integer value from `func_15()` is printed.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the following will be true:
- The loop will have run exactly `func_10()` times.
- A positive integer value from `func_15()` will have been printed for each of these iterations.

The state of `n` and `m` will remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head or body.

Thus, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **The loop has executed `func_10()` times, and a positive integer value from `func_15()` has been printed for each iteration. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.**

In simpler terms: The loop has completed all its iterations, printing a positive integer from `func_15()` each time, and `n` and `m` are still the same as they were initially.
