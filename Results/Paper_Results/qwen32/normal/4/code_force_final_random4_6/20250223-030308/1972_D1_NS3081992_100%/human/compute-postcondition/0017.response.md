Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `d[da]` has at least 3 elements, `processing` is a list of integers where `processing[di - 1]` is now 1, `da` is an integer, `rank` is a list of integers, and `tmp` is the minimum of its previous value and `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. `di` is the next element in `d[da]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `tmp` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the result of the function `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. All other variables retain their previous states.
