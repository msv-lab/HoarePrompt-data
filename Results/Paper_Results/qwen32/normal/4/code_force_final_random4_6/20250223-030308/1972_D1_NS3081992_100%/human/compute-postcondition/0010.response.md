To solve this, we need to calculate the new value of `ans` after the given operation. We start by noting that the initial value of `ans` is `n + 2`. The operation to be performed is `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)`.

Given:
- `i` is 3
- `n` must be at least 6
- `m` must be at least 3

First, we substitute the value of `i` into the expression `(n + i) // (i * i)`:
- `(n + 3) // (3 * 3) = (n + 3) // 9`

The integer division `//` means that we divide `(n + 3)` by 9 and take the floor of the result.

Next, we add this result to the initial value of `ans`:
- `ans = (n + 2) + ((n + 3) // 9)`

Since `n` must be at least 6, the minimum value of `ans` can be calculated by substituting `n = 6`:
- `ans = (6 + 2) + ((6 + 3) // 9) = 8 + (9 // 9) = 8 + 1 = 9`

However, since `n` can be any value greater than or equal to 6, the exact value of `ans` will depend on the specific value of `n`. But the formula `(n + 2) + ((n + 3) // 9)` gives the updated value of `ans` for any valid `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `ans` is `(n + 2) + ((n + 3) // 9)`**

In natural language, the output state means that the value of `ans` is updated to be the initial value of `n + 2` plus the integer division of `(n + 3)` by 9, while the values of `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged as per their initial conditions.
