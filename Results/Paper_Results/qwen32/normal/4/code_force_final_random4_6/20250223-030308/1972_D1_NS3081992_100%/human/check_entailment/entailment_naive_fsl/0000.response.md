Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem. The main function responsible for solving the problem is `func_15`, which calculates the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions specified in the problem description. However, the logic within `func_15` is not correct for the given problem.

The condition to be satisfied is that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided function `func_15` uses a loop that iterates up to \(\sqrt{n + i}\) and counts pairs based on a specific formula, which does not directly address the condition given in the problem.

To verify the correctness, let's consider the first test case provided in the problem description:

- Input: \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)
- Expected Output: 1 (since the only pair is \((1, 1)\) and \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\))

The function `func_15` will return `0` for this input, which is incorrect.

Let's consider another test case:

- Input: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)
- Expected Output: 3 (pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\))

The function `func_15` will not correctly count these pairs.

The logic in `func_15` does not properly iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To make the program correct, we would need to iterate through all pairs \((a, b)\) and check the given condition directly. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    return ans

def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if the condition is satisfied, ensuring that the output is correct for all cases.
