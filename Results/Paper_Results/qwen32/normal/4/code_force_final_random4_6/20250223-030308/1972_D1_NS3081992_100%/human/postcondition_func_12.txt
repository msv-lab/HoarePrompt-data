The function `func_13` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and finds coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. If `b` is 0, it returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it returns the coefficients `x` and `y` along with the GCD `g` that satisfy the equation.
