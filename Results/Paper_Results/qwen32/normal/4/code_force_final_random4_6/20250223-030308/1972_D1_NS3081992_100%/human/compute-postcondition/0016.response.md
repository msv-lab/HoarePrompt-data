Functionality: ** The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` representing the length of `a`, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It adjusts `k` by subtracting the sum of `(m - a[i])` for each element `a[i]` in `a` that is less than `m`. The function returns 1 if the adjusted `k` is non-negative, otherwise it returns -1. **
