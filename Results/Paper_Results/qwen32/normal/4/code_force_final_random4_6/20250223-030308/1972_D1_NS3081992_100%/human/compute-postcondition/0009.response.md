To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition `i <= m and i * i <= n + i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is at least 2
- `m` is at least 2
- `i` is 3
- `ans` is `n + 2`

Let's break down the conditions:
1. `i <= m`: Since `i` is 3, `m` must be at least 3 for this condition to be true.
2. `i * i <= n + i`: Substituting `i = 3` into the inequality, we get `3 * 3 <= n + 3`, which simplifies to `9 <= n + 3` or `6 <= n`. Since `n` is already at least 2, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 6 for this condition to be true.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `m` to be at least 3 and `n` to be at least 6.

State: **`n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `ans` is `n + 2`**
