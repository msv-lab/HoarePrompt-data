Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and a positive integer value from `func_15()` has been returned and printed, and `func_10()` must return a value of at least 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` does not affect the values of `n` and `m`. It only prints the return value of `func_15()` followed by a newline. The precondition that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range remains valid, and the requirement that `func_10()` must return a value of at least 1 is also unchanged.
