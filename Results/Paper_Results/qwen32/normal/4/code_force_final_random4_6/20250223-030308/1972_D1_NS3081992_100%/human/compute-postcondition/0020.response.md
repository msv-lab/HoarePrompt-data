Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `d[da]` has `n` elements, `processing` is a list of integers, `da` is an integer, `rank` is a list of integers, and `tmp` is the minimum of its previous value and `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all elements `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all iterations, the variable `tmp` will hold the smallest value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each element `di` in the list `d[da]` where the corresponding `processing[di - 1]` was 0 at the time of the function call. The other variables (`d`, `processing`, `da`, and `rank`) remain unchanged in structure, but `processing[di - 1]` for the elements that were processed will be reset to 0 after the function call.
