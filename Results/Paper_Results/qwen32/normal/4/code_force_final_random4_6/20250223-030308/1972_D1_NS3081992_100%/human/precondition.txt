d, processing, da, and rank are lists of integers. However, based on the problem description provided, the function definition seems incorrect. The function should take two integers n and m as input for each test case. Therefore, a correct function definition would be def count_valid_pairs(n, m):, where n and m are positive integers representing the constraints given in the problem.
