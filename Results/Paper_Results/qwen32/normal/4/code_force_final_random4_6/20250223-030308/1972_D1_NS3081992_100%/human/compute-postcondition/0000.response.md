In the given task, the loop will execute based on the return value of the function `func_10()`. The loop head only includes the underscore `_` and the result of `func_10()`. Since the underscore `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect whether the loop executes, we only need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer.

However, since we are not given any information about the implementation of `func_10()`, we can only assume that it will return a value that determines whether the loop executes. For the loop to execute at least once, `func_10()` must return a positive integer.

Given the state before the loop starts is that `n` and `m` are positive integers, we can't directly adjust `n` and `m` to make the loop execute because they are not part of the loop head. The only thing we can state is the requirement for `func_10()` to return a positive integer.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` must return a positive integer**
