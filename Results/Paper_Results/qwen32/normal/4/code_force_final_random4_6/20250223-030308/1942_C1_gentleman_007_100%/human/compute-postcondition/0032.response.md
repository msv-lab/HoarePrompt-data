The only object in the loop head is the variable `node`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `graph[ver]`. If there are more unprocessed nodes in `graph[ver]`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `node` was the last unprocessed node in `graph[ver]` that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another unprocessed node in `graph[ver]`.

Let's denote this new unprocessed node as `next_node`.

State: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` has the first element `ver` followed by the previous elements of `q` and now includes `node` at the end if `vis[node]` was 0, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `vis[node]` is 1 after the execution if `vis[node]` was 0, `graph[ver]` must have at least one unprocessed node, and `node` is `next_node` which is the next unprocessed node in `graph[ver]`**.

However, to maintain consistency with the previous state description, we should clarify that `node` is now the next unprocessed node, not `next_node`.

State: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` has the first element `ver` followed by the previous elements of `q` and now includes `node` at the end if `vis[node]` was 0, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `vis[node]` is 1 after the execution if `vis[node]` was 0, `graph[ver]` must have at least one unprocessed node, and `node` is the next unprocessed node in `graph[ver]`**.
