Postcondition: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of `q`, `q` has one less element initially. If `not vis[node]`, then `q` has one more element which is `node`, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` including `node`, and `vis[node]` is 1. Otherwise, `q` has one less element and `vis` remains unchanged. `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element.**
