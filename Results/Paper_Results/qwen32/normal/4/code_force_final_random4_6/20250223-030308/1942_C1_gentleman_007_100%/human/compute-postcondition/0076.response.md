Output State: **`i` is `i - 1` and must be greater than 0; `j` is `j - 1` and must be greater than 0.**

Natural language: The value of `j` is decremented by 1, while the value of `i` remains `i - 1` and still must be greater than 0. The condition that `j` must be greater than 0 is still valid after the decrement.
