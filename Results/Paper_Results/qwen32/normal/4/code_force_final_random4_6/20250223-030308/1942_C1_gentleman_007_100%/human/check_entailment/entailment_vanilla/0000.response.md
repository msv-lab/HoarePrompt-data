To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem described. The problem involves calculating the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed given a regular polygon with `n` sides, where `x` vertices are already chosen and `y` additional vertices can be chosen (with `y = 0` in this version). 

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Vertices and Diagonals**: The vertices of the polygon are numbered from 1 to `n`. The problem requires forming non-intersecting diagonals using vertices to create triangles.
2. **Constraints**: We can only use the `x` vertices provided and cannot add any more vertices (`y = 0`), so we must work within the given vertices.
3. **Objective**: Maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles formed by the chosen vertices.

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided Python program includes a variety of functions that seem to be unrelated to solving the specific problem at hand. The functions range from basic utilities like reading input and counting elements to more complex operations like prime factorization and dynamic programming.

#### Relevant Functions for the Problem:
- **Input Reading**: Functions `func_1` and `func_2` read integers from input.
- **Graph Representation**: Functions like `func_5` and `func_6` create adjacency lists and adjacency matrices, which might be useful if we were considering the vertices and edges as a graph. However, this problem is more about combinatorial geometry rather than graph theory.
- **Utility Functions**: Other functions like `gcd`, `bisect_left`, and various mathematical utilities do not directly contribute to solving the specific problem.

#### Approach to Solve the Problem:
To maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles, we need to consider the following:
- **Choosing Vertices**: Since `y = 0`, we can only use the `x` vertices provided.
- **Forming Triangles**: We need to form triangles using these vertices such that no two diagonals intersect.
- **Maximizing Triangles**: The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices is `x - 2` if the vertices form a convex polygon (which they do, as the vertices are part of a regular polygon).

#### Implementation:
The program does not contain any implementation that directly calculates the maximum number of triangles based on the given vertices. It lacks a function that takes the list of vertices and computes the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles.

### Conclusion:
The provided program includes several utility functions but does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem as described. The program does not compute the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using the given vertices.

**Correctness: False**

The program is incorrect because it lacks the specific logic required to solve the problem of maximizing non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake given the constraints.
