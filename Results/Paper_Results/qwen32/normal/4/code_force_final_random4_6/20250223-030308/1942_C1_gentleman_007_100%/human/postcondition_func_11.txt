The function accepts an integer `num` greater than 1 and a list or array `Prime_array` where `Prime_array[i]` is the smallest prime factor of `i` for all `i` from 2 to `num`. It returns a dictionary `d` containing the prime factorization of `num` with each prime factor as keys and their respective counts as values.
