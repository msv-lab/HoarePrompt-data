Output State: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of `q`, `q` has one more element which is `node`, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` including `node`, and `vis[node]` is 1, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element.**

In simple terms, after the code execution, `vis[node]` is now set to 1, indicating that `node` is now considered reachable from the initial `ver`. All other conditions and states remain unchanged.
