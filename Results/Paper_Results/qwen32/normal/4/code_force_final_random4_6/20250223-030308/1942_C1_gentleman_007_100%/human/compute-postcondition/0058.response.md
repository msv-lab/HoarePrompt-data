Postcondition: **The `dp` matrix is fully populated with the lengths of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between all prefixes of `a` and `b`. The value at `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the LCS between the entire lists `a` and `b`. `i` is 1, and `j` is 1. `l` is an empty list. The value at `dp[i][j]` is not equal to the value at `dp[i][j - 1]`, and the value at `dp[i][j]` is not equal to the value at `dp[i - 1][j]`.**
