Postcondition: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` has had its first element removed, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `vis[node]` is 1 for each `node` in `q`, `graph[ver]` must have at least one node, and `vis[node]` is 0 for the current `node` being considered.**
