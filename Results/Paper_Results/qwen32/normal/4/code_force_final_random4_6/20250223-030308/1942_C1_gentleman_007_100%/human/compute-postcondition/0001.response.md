The code snippet `q.append(ver)` adds the value of `ver` to the end of the deque `q`. Given that `q` was initially empty, after this operation, `q` will contain one element, which is `ver`. The values of `ver`, `graph`, `vis`, and the precondition that `q` was initially empty remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where each key (or index) is a vertex and its value is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is a deque containing the single element `ver`.**
