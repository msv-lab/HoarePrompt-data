Postcondition: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of `q`, `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`, `q` includes `node` if it was not already visited, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` including `node`, and `vis[node]` is 1 if `node` was not already visited.**
