The given code snippet sets `vis[node]` to 1. However, the initial state already specifies that `vis[node]` is 1. Therefore, executing this line does not change the value of `vis[node]` or any other variable in the system.

Output State: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of `q`, `q` has one more element which is `node`, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` including `node`, and `vis[node]` is 1. `graph[ver]` must contain at least one more element, and `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`.**
