Output State: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of `q`, `q` is empty, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` and 0 for all other vertices.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the queue `q` is empty because all reachable vertices from the initial `ver` have been processed. The variable `vis` indicates that all vertices reachable from the starting vertex `ver` have been visited (marked as 1), while all other vertices remain unvisited (marked as 0). The variable `ver` retains its value as the vertex that was initially at the front of the queue `q`.
