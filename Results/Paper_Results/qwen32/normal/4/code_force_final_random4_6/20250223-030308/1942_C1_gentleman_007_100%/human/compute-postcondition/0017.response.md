Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `graph[ver]` must contain at least one more adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `vis[node]` is now 1, `q` is a deque with `node` appended to it, `node` is the next adjacent vertex in `graph[ver]` that has not yet been processed.**

In natural language: The vertex `node` has been marked as visited by setting `vis[node]` to 1. All other variables retain their previous states.
