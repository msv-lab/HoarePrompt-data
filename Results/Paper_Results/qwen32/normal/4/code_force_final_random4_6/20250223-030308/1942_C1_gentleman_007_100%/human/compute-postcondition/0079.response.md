Postcondition: **`i` and `j` are both greater than 0. If `dp[i][j]` was equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `j` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is decreased by 1, and if `dp[i][j]` was equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, `j` remains unchanged; otherwise, `j` is decreased by 1 and `l` has an additional element `a[i]` appended to it.**
