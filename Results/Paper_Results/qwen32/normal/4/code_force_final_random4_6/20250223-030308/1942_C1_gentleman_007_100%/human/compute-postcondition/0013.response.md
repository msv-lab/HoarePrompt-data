The code sets `vis[node]` to 1, marking the `node` as visited. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `graph[ver]` must contain at least one more adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is a deque with `node` appended to it, and `vis[ver]` is 1, `vis[node]` is 1.**
