Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` has had its first element removed, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, and `vis[node]` is 1 for each `node` in `q`.
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ver` is the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` has the first element `ver` followed by the previous elements of `q` and now includes `node` at the end if `vis[node]` was 0. `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, and `vis[node]` is 1 after the execution if `vis[node]` was 0. `graph[ver]` must have at least one node. If `vis[node]` was already 1, `q` and `vis` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ver` is the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` has the first element `ver` followed by the previous elements of `q` and now includes `node` at the end if `vis[node]` was 0, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `vis[node]` is 1 after the execution if `vis[node]` was 0, `graph[ver]` must have at least one unprocessed node, and `node` is the next unprocessed node in `graph[ver]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ver` is the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` has the first element `ver` followed by the previous elements of `q` and now includes `node` at the end if `vis[node]` was 0, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `vis[node]` is 1 after the execution if `vis[node]` was 0, `graph[ver]` must have at least one unprocessed node, and `node` is the next unprocessed node in `graph[ver]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
