Output State: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` has the first element `ver` followed by the previous elements of `q` and now includes `node` at the end, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `vis[node]` is 1, `graph[ver]` must have at least one unprocessed node, and `node` is the next unprocessed node in `graph[ver]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `vis[node]` has been set to 1, indicating that the vertex `node` has been visited. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
