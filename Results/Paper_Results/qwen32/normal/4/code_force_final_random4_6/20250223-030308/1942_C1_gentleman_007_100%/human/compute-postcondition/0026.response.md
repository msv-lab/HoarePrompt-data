The code sets `vis[node]` to 1, indicating that the vertex `node` has been visited. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` has the first element `ver` followed by the previous elements of `q` and now includes `node` at the end, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `vis[node]` is 1, `graph[ver]` must have at least one node, and `vis[node]` is 0 for the current `node` being considered except now `vis[node]` is 1.**
