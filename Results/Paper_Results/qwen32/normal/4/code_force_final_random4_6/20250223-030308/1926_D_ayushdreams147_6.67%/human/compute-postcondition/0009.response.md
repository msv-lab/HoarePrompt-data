The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which is used to iterate over the list `a`. Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider what `num` should be next.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31.
- The behavior of `res` and `count` dictionary depends on whether `num` is in `count` or not, but these do not affect the loop iteration itself.

Since `num` is the current element being processed in the list `a`, at the start of the next iteration, `num` should be the next element in the list.

Let's denote the current index of `num` in the list `a` as `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was `a[k]`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `num` should be `a[k+1]`.

However, we don't have the exact value of `k` from the given state, but we can infer that `num` should be the next element in the list `a` that hasn't been processed yet.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `num` is the next element in the list `a` that hasn't been processed yet.**
