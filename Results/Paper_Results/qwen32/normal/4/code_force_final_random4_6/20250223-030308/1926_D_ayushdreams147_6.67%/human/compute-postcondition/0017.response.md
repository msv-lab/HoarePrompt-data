The code snippet `count[num] -= 1` decrements the value associated with the key `num` in the dictionary `count` by 1. The initial state provides the precondition that `n` is an integer within a specific range, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` is within a specific range, and `num` is the next element in the list `a` that hasn't been processed yet. 

Since `num` is the next element in the list `a`, and `count[num]` is being decremented, the value of `count[num]` is reduced by 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and any other elements in `count` that are not `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `num` is the next element in the list `a` that hasn't been processed yet, `count[num]` is decreased by 1.**
