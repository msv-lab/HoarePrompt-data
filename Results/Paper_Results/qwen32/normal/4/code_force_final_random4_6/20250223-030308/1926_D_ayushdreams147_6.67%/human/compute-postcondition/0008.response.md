Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31. If `num` is not in the `count` dictionary, then `res` is set to 1 and `count` is updated to include the key `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` with the value 1. If `num` is already in the `count` dictionary, then `res` remains 0 and the value associated with the key `num` in `count` is decreased by 1.**
