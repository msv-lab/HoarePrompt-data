The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of the variable `res` by 1. The values of `n`, `a`, `num`, and `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `num` is the next element in the list `a` that hasn't been processed yet, `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1, `res` is incremented by 1.**
