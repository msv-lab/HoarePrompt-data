The code snippet initializes a variable `res` to 0. The values of `n` and the list `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31; `res` is 0.**
