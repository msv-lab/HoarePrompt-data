To determine what will be printed by the `print(start_year)` statement, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables involved. Let's break it down step by step based on the provided initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. This indicates the number of test cases.
- `num_tests` is greater than 0 or `num_tests` is 0 if it was initially 1. This variable seems to be related to the number of tests but its exact role isn't clear from the provided context.
- `n` is an input integer, presumably related to the number of elements in the `nums` list.
- `nums` is a list of integers. The exact contents of this list are not provided.
- `start_year` is the result of the loop's final calculation. However, no loop is shown in the provided code snippet, so we can only infer that `start_year` is set somewhere in the code that isn't provided.

Since the exact value of `start_year` is not provided and the loop that calculates it is not shown, we can only describe `start_year` in terms of the final result of that calculation.

Given the information, the output will be the final value of `start_year` after whatever calculations or logic are applied to it within the loop or other parts of the code.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the result of the loop's final calculation)**
