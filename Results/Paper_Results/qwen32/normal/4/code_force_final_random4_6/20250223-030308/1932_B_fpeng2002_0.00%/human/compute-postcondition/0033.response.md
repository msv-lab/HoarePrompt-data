To determine the output state, we'll evaluate the impact of the provided code snippet on the variables given in the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `start_year` is 0
- `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `nums` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element

The code snippet:
```python
start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
```

Let's break down the expression:
- `start_year + 1` evaluates to `0 + 1` which is `1`.
- `1 // nums[x]` performs integer division of `1` by the `x`-th element of `nums`. The result will be `0` if `nums[x]` is greater than `1`, and `1` if `nums[x]` is `1`.
- Adding `1` to the result of the integer division will yield `1` if `nums[x]` is greater than `1`, and `2` if `nums[x]` is `1`.
- Multiplying this result by `nums[x]` will give `nums[x]` if `nums[x]` is greater than `1`, and `2 * nums[x]` if `nums[x]` is `1`.

Thus, `start_year` will be updated to `nums[x]` if `nums[x]` is greater than `1`, and `2 * nums[x]` if `nums[x]` is `1`.

The values of `num_tests`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`start_year` is `nums[x]` if `nums[x]` is greater than `1`, otherwise `start_year` is `2 * nums[x]`; `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element.**
