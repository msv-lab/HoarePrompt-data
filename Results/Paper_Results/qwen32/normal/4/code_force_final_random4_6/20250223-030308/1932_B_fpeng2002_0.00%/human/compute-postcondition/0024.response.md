The given code snippet updates the value of `start_year` based on the current value of `start_year` and the value at the index `x` of the list `nums`. 

Given the initial state, the value of `start_year` is recalculated using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula ensures that `start_year` is adjusted to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`.

The other variables (`t`, `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `x`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `num_tests` is greater than 0 minus 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, `x` is `x + 1`**.
