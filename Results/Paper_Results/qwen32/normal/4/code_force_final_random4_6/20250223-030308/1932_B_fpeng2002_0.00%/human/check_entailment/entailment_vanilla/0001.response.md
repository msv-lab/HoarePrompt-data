Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given the periodicity of each sign and the condition that signs must occur sequentially.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and their periodicities (`nums`).

2. **Logic to Determine the Year of the n-th Sign:**
   - The program initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year considering the previous sign's occurrence year (`start_year`).
   - The formula used to calculate the next occurrence year is:
     ```python
     start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
     ```
   - Let's break this down:
     - `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]` computes the number of complete cycles that have passed or are starting from `start_year + 1` to the next multiple of `nums[x]`.
     - Adding 1 to this result ensures we are considering the next occurrence strictly after `start_year`.
     - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the exact year of the next occurrence.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `start_year`, which is the year when the n-th sign occurs.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - Initial `start_year = 0`
   - Iteration 1: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
   - Iteration 2: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
   - Iteration 3: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
   - Iteration 4: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
   - Iteration 5: `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
   - Iteration 6: `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (matches the expected result)

2. **Other Test Cases:**
   - Similarly, the program correctly calculates the year for other test cases as well.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year of the n-th sign's occurrence, adhering to the sequential occurrence condition. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
