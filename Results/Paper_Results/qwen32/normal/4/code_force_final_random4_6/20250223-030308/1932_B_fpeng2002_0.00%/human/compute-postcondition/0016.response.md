`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`t`, `num_tests`, `nums`, `start_year`) are not affected, so their states remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `num_tests` is greater than 0 minus 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers, `start_year` is the result of the loop's final calculation.**
