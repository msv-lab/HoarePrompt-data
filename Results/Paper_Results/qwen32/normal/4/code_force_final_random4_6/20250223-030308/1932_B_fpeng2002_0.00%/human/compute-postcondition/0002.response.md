The value of `num_tests` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `num_tests` must be greater than 0, after this operation, `num_tests` will still be greater than 0 unless it was exactly 1 before the decrement, in which case it will be 0. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is greater than 0 or `num_tests` is 0 if it was initially 1.**
