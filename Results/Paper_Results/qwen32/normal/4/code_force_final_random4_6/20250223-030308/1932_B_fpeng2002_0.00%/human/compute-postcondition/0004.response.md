The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The values of `t` and `num_tests` remain unchanged. The variable `n` is an input integer, but its value is not used in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is greater than 0 or `num_tests` is 0 if it was initially 1; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting space-separated input values to integers.**
