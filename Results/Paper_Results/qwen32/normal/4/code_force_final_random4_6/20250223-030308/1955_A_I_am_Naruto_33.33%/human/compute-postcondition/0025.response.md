Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given conditions. Specifically, it computes two possible values: `ans1` as `a * n` and `ans2` as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` when `n` is greater than 1, and directly prints `a` when `n` is 1. The function prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case.**
