Based on the initial state provided, we know that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers that are read from the input. However, the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not explicitly provided in the precondition.

The `print(a)` statement will output the value of the variable `a`, which is the second integer read from the input.

Since the exact value of `a` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `a`.

Output: **a (where a is the second integer from the input)**
