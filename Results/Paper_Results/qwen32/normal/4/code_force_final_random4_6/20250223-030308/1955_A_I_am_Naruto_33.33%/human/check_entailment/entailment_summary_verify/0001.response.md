### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts.
   - The price for one yogurt is `a` burles.
   - The price for two yogurts is `b` burles.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1`: Cost if all yogurts are bought individually, which is `a * n`.
     - `ans2`: Cost if yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible, which is `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
   - It prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function correctly computes `ans1` as `a * n`.
   - The function correctly computes `ans2` as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
   - The function handles the case when `n == 1` by printing `a`.

4. **Example Validation**:
   - **Test Case 1:** `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
     - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9`
     - Minimum cost is `9`.

   - **Test Case 2:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 18 + 5 = 23`
     - Minimum cost is `15`.

   - **Test Case 3:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 22 + 5 = 27`
     - Minimum cost is `15`.

   - **Test Case 4:** `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
     - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 22`
     - Minimum cost is `20`.

The original assessment is correct. The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case by comparing the cost of buying yogurts individually (`ans1`) and the cost of buying them in pairs (`ans2`).

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts.

Final: **True**
