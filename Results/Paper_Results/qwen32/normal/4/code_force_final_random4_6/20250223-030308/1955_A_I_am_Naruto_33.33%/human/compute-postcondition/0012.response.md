Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input, `ans1` is `a * n`, `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `ans1` remain unchanged.
