Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, given the price `a` for one yogurt and the price `b` for two yogurts on promotion.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then for each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**:
    - If `n > 1`, the program calculates two potential costs:
        - `ans1`: The cost if all yogurts are bought individually, which is `a * n`.
        - `ans2`: The cost if yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible, with any remaining yogurt bought individually. This is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
    - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs.
    - If `n == 1`, the program correctly prints `a` because there's no discount for buying two yogurts in such a case.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**:
    - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
    - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
    - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
    - Minimum cost is `9`.
    - **Correct**.

2. **Second Test Case**:
    - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
    - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
    - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
    - Minimum cost is `14`.
    - **Correct**.

3. **Third Test Case**:
    - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
    - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
    - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
    - Minimum cost is `15`.
    - **Correct**.

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
    - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
    - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
    - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
    - Minimum cost is `20`.
    - **Correct**.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case based on the given conditions.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
