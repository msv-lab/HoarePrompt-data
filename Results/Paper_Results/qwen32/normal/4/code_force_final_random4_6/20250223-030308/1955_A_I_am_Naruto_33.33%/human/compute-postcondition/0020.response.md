To determine what will be printed, we need to evaluate the expressions for `ans1` and `ans2` based on the given initial state.

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `a` is the second integer from the input.
   - `b` is the third integer from the input.
   - `ans1` is calculated as `a * n`.
   - `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

2. **Expressions:**
   - `ans1` is straightforward: it is the product of `a` and `n`.
   - `ans2` is a bit more complex:
     - `b * n // 2` calculates half of the product of `b` and `n` (integer division).
     - `a * n % 2` calculates the remainder when the product of `a` and `n` is divided by 2 (i.e., it checks if `a * n` is odd or even).
     - The two results are then added together.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the minimum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.

Given the expressions, the output will depend on the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, we can describe the final output in terms of these variables.

Output: **min(a * n, b * n // 2 + a * n % 2) (where `a`, `b`, and `n` are integers provided as input)**
