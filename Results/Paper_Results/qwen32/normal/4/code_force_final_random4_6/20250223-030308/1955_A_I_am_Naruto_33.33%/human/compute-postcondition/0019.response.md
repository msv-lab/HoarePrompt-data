The code assigns the value of `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` to `ans2`. Given the initial state, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, and `b` is the third integer from the input. The value of `ans1` is `a * n` and is not affected by the code snippet provided. The condition `if n > 1` is not checked in this code snippet, so `ans2` is always calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` regardless of the value of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input, `ans1` is `a * n`, `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.**
