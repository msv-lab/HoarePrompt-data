To determine what will be printed by the `print(a)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `a` is the second integer from the input.
- `b` is the third integer from the input.
- If `n` > 1, then `ans1` is `a * n` and `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. Otherwise, `ans1` and `ans2` are not defined.

The `print(a)` statement is straightforward. It simply prints the value of the variable `a`, which is the second integer from the input.

Since the exact value of `a` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it as the second integer from the input.

Output: **a (where a is the second integer from the input)**
