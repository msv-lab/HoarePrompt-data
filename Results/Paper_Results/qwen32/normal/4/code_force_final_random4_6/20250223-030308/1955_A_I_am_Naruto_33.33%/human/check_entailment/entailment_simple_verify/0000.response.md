### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code to ensure the correctness of the solution based on the problem description.

#### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (the number of yogurts), `a` (the price for one yogurt), and `b` (the price for two yogurts on promotion). The goal is to determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

The logic used in the program is as follows:
- If `n > 1`:
  - `ans1` is calculated as the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price: `a * n`.
  - `ans2` is calculated as the cost if as many yogurts as possible are bought in pairs at the promotion price, and the remaining yogurt (if any) is bought at the regular price: `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
  - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
- If `n == 1`, it simply prints the cost of one yogurt, i.e., `a`.

#### Correctness Check

Let's verify if this logic covers all potential cases and edge cases:

1. **Case 1: `n == 1`**
   - The program correctly prints `a` since there's only one yogurt to buy.
   - Example: `n = 1, a = 5, b = 9` → Output: `5`.

2. **Case 2: `n` is even**
   - The program calculates the cost if all yogurts are bought in pairs at the promotion price.
   - Example: `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11` → `ans1 = 20`, `ans2 = 22` → Output: `20`.

3. **Case 3: `n` is odd**
   - The program calculates the cost if all but one yogurt are bought in pairs at the promotion price, and the remaining yogurt is bought at the regular price.
   - Example: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9` → `ans1 = 15`, `ans2 = 14` → Output: `14`.

4. **Case 4: `b >= 2 * a`**
   - If the promotion price is not cheaper than buying two yogurts at the regular price, the program should fall back to buying all yogurts at the regular price.
   - Example: `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11` → `ans1 = 20`, `ans2 = 22` → Output: `20`.

5. **Case 5: `b < 2 * a`**
   - If the promotion price is cheaper, the program should use the promotion as much as possible.
   - Example: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9` → `ans1 = 15`, `ans2 = 14` → Output: `14`.

#### Edge Cases

- **Minimum Values**: `n = 1, a = 1, b = 1`
  - Output: `1` (correct).
  
- **Maximum Values**: `n = 100, a = 30, b = 30`
  - `ans1 = 3000`, `ans2 = 1500` → Output: `1500` (correct).

- **Promotion is not beneficial**: `n = 2, a = 5, b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 10`, `ans2 = 11` → Output: `10` (correct).

- **Promotion is beneficial**: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 15`, `ans2 = 14` → Output: `14` (correct).

The annotated code confirms that the program correctly handles the logic for different values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. The annotations show the state of the program at key points, which align with the expected behavior.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all scenarios described in the problem statement. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to produce incorrect results.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**
