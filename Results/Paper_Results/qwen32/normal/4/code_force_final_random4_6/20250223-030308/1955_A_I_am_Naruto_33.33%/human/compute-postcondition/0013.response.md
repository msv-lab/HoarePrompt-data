To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given variables and the formula used in the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly used in the print statement.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `a` is the second integer from the input.
- `b` is the third integer from the input.
- `ans1` is calculated as `a * n`.
- `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(min(ans1, ans2))
```
This means the code will print the smaller value between `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Calculations:
1. **`ans1` Calculation:**
   \[
   ans1 = a \times n
   \]
   This is simply the product of `a` and `n`.

2. **`ans2` Calculation:**
   \[
   ans2 = b \times \left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + a \times (n \mod 2)
   \]
   - `b * (n // 2)` gives the product of `b` and the integer division of `n` by 2.
   - `a * (n % 2)` gives the product of `a` and the remainder when `n` is divided by 2. This term will be `a` if `n` is odd, and `0` if `n` is even.

### Output Description:
The output will be the minimum value between `ans1` and `ans2`. Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

- If `n` is even:
  - `ans2` simplifies to `b * (n // 2)`.
  - The output will be the smaller value between `a * n` and `b * (n // 2)`.

- If `n` is odd:
  - `ans2` simplifies to `b * (n // 2) + a`.
  - The output will be the smaller value between `a * n` and `b * (n // 2) + a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **min(a * n, b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)) (where a, b, and n are the second, third, and first integers from the input respectively)**
