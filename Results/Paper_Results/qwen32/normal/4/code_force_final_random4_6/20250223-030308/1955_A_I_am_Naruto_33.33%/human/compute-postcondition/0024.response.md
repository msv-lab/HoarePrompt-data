Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function returns a value based on these inputs for each test case. The specific return value is not detailed in the provided constraints and relationships, but it operates under the conditions that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 30`, and `1 ≤ b ≤ 30`.**
