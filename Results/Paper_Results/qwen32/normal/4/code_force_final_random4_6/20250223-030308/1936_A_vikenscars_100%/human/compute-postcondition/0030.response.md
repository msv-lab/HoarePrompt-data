The code snippet `pair_idx = i` sets the value of `pair_idx` to the current value of `i`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`max_item_idx` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns `'<'`. If `ans1` is `'<'`, `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`. If `ans1` is `'='`, then `pair_idx` is set to `i` if `ans2` is `'>'`; otherwise, `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx`. `n` is greater than 0, and `ans1` is now the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`. If `ans1` was `'='`, `ans2` retains its original value. `i` is incremented by 1. `pair_idx` is equal to `i`.**
