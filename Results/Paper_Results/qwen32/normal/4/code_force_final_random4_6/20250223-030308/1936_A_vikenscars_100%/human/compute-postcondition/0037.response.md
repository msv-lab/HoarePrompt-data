The code snippet updates the value of `ans1` by calling the function `func_1` with the arguments `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, `max_item_idx`, and `i`. The values of `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, and `i` remain unchanged, but `ans1` is now the result of the function call.

Based on the initial state, `ans1` was previously the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)` before the current execution of the line. After executing the line, `ans1` gets a new value, which is the result of the function call with the same arguments.

The rest of the variables (`n`, `ans2`, `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_item_idx` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns `'<'`. If `ans1` is `'<'`, `pair_idx` is set to `i`. If `ans1` is `'='` and `ans2` is `'>'`, then `pair_idx` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx`. `n` is greater than 0, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`. If `ans1` was `'='`, `ans2` retains its original value unless `ans1` is `'='` and `ans2` is `'>'`, in which case `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`. `i` is incremented by 1.**
