The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `max_item_idx`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is only mentioned in the precondition and not altered by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4; `max_item_idx` is 0.**
