Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **max_item_idx**: This is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the function `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns `'<'`. This suggests that `max_item_idx` is an index where the comparison function `func_1` indicates a certain relationship with other indices.

2. **pair_idx**: This is the index of the item that is considered greater than all other items when compared using the function `func_1`. This implies that `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum or dominant item based on the criteria defined by `func_1`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}')
```

### Analysis:
- **max_item_idx**: This variable holds the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the comparison `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` results in `'<'`. This means that at this index, the function indicates a specific relationship, possibly that the element at `max_item_idx` is less than the element at index `i`.

- **pair_idx**: This variable holds the index of the item that is greater than all other items when compared using `func_1`. This means that the element at `pair_idx` is the maximum or dominant element according to the comparison function `func_1`.

### Output:
The print statement will output a formatted string that includes the values of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`.

Output: **! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx] (where max_item_idx is the largest index i (from 1 to n-1) for which func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i) returns '<', and pair_idx is the index of the item that is greater than all other items when compared using func_1)**
