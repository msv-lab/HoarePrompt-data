The code snippet provided updates the value of `max_item_idx` to `i`. The other variables (`n`, `ans`) are not modified by this code.

Given that `max_item_idx` is initially set to 0, after the execution of the code, `max_item_idx` will hold the value of `i`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state but is used to update `max_item_idx`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4; `max_item_idx` is `i`; `ans` is the result of `func_1(0, 0, i, i)` and `ans` is equal to '<'.**
