The code snippet provided assigns the value of `i` to `pair_idx`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the value of `pair_idx` changes from its previous value (`max_item_idx`) to the value of `i`. The other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`max_item_idx` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns `'<'`; `pair_idx` is equal to `i`; `n` is greater than 0; `ans1` is `'='`; `ans2` is `'>'`.**

In natural language: The value of `pair_idx` is now equal to `i`, while `max_item_idx`, `n`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.
