Postcondition: **`max_item_idx` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns `'<'`. If `ans1` is `'<'`, `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`. If `ans1` is `'='`, then `pair_idx` is set to `i` if `ans2` is `'>'`; otherwise, `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx`. `n` is greater than 0, and `ans1` retains its value as either `'<'` or `'='`. If `ans1` is `'='`, `ans2` retains its original value.**
