Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`. It simply continues to the next iteration of the loop (if inside a loop), but since no loop is specified in the provided context, the state remains unchanged.
