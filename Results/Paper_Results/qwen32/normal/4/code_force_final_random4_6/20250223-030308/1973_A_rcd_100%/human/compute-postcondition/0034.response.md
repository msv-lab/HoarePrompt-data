The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common placeholder for a loop variable when the loop variable is not used in the loop body. The loop will execute `t` times. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `t`.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and the loop will execute `t` times, at the start of each iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the number of remaining iterations.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program does not perform any additional actions. Otherwise, the loop terminates either by printing `p1 - x + p3` if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, or by printing `p3` if `y` is less than `x`.

Since the loop head only involves `_`, and the loop will run `t` times, we decrement `t` by 1 to prepare for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program does not perform any additional actions. Otherwise, the loop terminates either by printing `p1 - x + p3` if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, or by printing `p3` if `y` is less than `x`.**
