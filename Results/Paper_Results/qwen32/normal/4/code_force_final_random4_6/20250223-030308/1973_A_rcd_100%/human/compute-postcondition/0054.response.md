The code snippet `y -= 1` decreases the value of `y` by 1. Given the initial state, `y` is either `p3` or `max(1, p3 - 1)` depending on the value of `x`. Since `x` is either 1 or 2, `y` is `max(1, p3 - 1)`.

- If `p3` is 1, `y` is `max(1, 1 - 1)`, which is `1`. After `y -= 1`, `y` becomes `0`.
- If `p3` is greater than 1, `y` is `p3 - 1`. After `y -= 1`, `y` becomes `p3 - 2`.

Therefore, `y` becomes either `0` if `p3` was `1`, or `p3 - 2` if `p3` was greater than `1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `x` is either 1 or 2; `y` is `0` if `p3` was `1`, or `p3 - 2` if `p3` was greater than `1`.**
