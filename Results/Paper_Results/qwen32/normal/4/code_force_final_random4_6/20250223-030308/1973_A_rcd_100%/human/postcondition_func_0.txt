The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` such that `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`. For each test case, it prints a value based on the conditions: if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, it prints `-1`. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a value determined by the conditions `p1 - x ≤ p2 - y` within a nested loop.
