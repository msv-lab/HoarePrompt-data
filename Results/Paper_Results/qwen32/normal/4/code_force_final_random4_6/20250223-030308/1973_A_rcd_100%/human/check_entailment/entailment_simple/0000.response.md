### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program to understand if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Total Points Check**:
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because in a valid set of games, the total points should always be even (since each game awards either 2 points in total or 2 points distributed as 1+1 in case of a draw).

2. **Max Draws When p3 >= p1 + p2**:
   - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2`. This is because the maximum number of draws possible is when the highest-scoring player (with `p3` points) has won all the games against the other two players, and the other two players have drawn all the games among themselves. In this scenario, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`.

3. **Calculating Draws When p3 < p1 + p2**:
   - If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws. It initializes `x` and `y` to `0` and `p3` respectively and iterates while `y` is greater than or equal to `x`. During each iteration, it checks if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. If this condition is met, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop. If the loop completes without finding such `x` and `y`, it prints `p3`.

   - The logic here is to find a valid distribution of wins and draws such that the total points add up correctly. The loop is trying to balance the points between the players in a way that maximizes the number of draws.

### Correctness Verification:

- **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0` → No games played, so no draws. The program correctly prints `0`.
- **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1` → One draw between the second and third player. The program correctly prints `1`.
- **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1` → Impossible to achieve with the given rules. The program correctly prints `-1`.
- **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2` → Two draws between the players. The program correctly prints `2`.
- **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3` → Impossible to achieve with the given rules. The program correctly prints `-1`.
- **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5` → Six draws among the players. The program correctly prints `6`.
- **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10` → Impossible to achieve with the given rules. The program correctly prints `2`.

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to correctly handle the given problem and the provided test cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
