To determine what will be printed by the code snippet, we need to analyze the given initial state and the code. Let's break it down step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 499. This implies that `t` is an integer in the range [1, 500].
2. `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input.
3. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
4. `p3` must be at least 4.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(p1 - x + p3)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `x` is not defined in the initial state or the provided code snippet. This means that the variable `x` is either undefined or should be provided as part of the input or context which is missing here.
- Since `x` is not defined, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the expression `p1 - x + p3`.
- However, we can still describe the output in terms of the variables provided.

### Output Description:
The `print` statement will output the value of the expression `p1 - x + p3`. Since `x` is not defined, we cannot provide a specific numerical value, but we can describe the output in terms of the variables.

Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where p1, p3 are integers read from the input and x is an undefined variable)**
