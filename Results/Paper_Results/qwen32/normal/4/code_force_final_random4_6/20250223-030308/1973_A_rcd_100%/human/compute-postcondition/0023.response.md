Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is less than `p1 + p2` and `p3` must be at least 2 if `x` is 2 and `y` is `p3 - 1`; `x` is increased by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `x` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and values remain the same.
