The code snippet provided initializes a variable `tmp` as an empty string. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the new variable `tmp` being introduced.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was encountered in `s`, `cur` is the bitmask of characters encountered in the final segment of `s` that did not complete a sequence of `k` distinct characters, and `cnt` is less than `n`; `tmp` is an empty string.**
