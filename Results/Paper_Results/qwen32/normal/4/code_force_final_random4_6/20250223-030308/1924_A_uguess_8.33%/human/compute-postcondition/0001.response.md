In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable, and `t`, which is the range limit. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1, because `range(t)` will generate at least one value (0) if `t` is greater than 0.

The other variables `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute. Their values are given as part of the problem statement and do not affect whether the loop executes or not.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure that the loop can execute. Since `t` is already given to be an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. However, to be explicit in the state, we can confirm that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, 1 <= `k` <= 26, and 1 <= `m` <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets**
