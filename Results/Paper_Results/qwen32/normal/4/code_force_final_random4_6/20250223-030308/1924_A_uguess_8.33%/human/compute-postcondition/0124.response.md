The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` modifies the value of `cur` by adding to it the result of `1` left-shifted by `cur_ss` bits. This operation effectively sets the `cur_ss`-th bit of `cur` to 1.

Given the initial state, the value of `cur` is not specified, but we know `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.). Therefore, the value of `cur` will be updated based on this bit operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.), `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`**.
