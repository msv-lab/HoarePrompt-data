The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss`, which iterates over the string `s`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `ss` and how it will change as the loop progresses.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5.
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers.
- `s` is a non-empty input string.
- `cur_ss` is `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')`.
- If `cur` was originally equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.
- If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`.
- `ss` is the second character of `s`.
- If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` before the if statement, then `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, the values of `cnt` and `cur` remain as per the conditions described.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` was the current character of the string `s` that was processed. For the next iteration, `ss` will be the next character in the string `s`.

Since the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `ss` will be the next character in the string after the current character `ss`.

Let's denote the current character at the end of the previous iteration as `s[i]`. At the start of the next iteration, `ss` will be `s[i + 1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current character, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[i + 1]) - ord('a')` if `ss` was `s[i]`, `cnt` and `cur` remain as per the conditions described**.

To be more specific, if `ss` was `s[i]` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `ss` will be `s[i + 1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current character, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cnt` and `cur` remain as per the conditions described**.
