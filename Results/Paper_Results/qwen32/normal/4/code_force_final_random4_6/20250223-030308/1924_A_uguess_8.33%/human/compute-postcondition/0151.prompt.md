Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, 1 <= `k` <= 26, and 1 <= `m` <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was encountered in `s`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `cur` is the bitmask of characters encountered in the final segment of `s` that did not complete a sequence of `k` distinct characters. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is the bitmask of characters encountered in the final segment of `s` that did not complete a sequence of `k` distinct characters, `i` is `k-1`, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet if the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains the last valid character assigned, and `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet if `cnt` is 0, otherwise the last valid character assigned, and `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` remains unchanged, `tmp` is the last letter in the alphabet corresponding to a 0 bit in `cur` if any, otherwise it remains as the initial value, and `ans` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then concatenated with 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are the input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times. Otherwise, `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt + 1` times followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
