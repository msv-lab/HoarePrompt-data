The code snippet provided sets the variable `cur` to 0. This assignment does not affect any other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this change while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current character, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, and `cur` is 0.**
