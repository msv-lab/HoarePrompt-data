Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current character, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged and `cnt` remains unchanged.**
