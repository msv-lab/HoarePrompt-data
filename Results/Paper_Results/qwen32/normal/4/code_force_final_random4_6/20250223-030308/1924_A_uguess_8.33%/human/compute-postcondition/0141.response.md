The code snippet `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` changes the value of `tmp` based on the current value of `i`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, the value of `tmp` will be the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the value of `i`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1, if `i` was initially 0, it would now be 1. Therefore, `tmp` would be `chr(ord('a') + 1)`, which is `b`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` are the input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'b', and `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, `i` is 1**.
