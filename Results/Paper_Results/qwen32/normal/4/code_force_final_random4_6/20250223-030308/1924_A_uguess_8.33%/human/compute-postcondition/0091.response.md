The code snippet `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` calculates the character corresponding to the ASCII value of 'a' plus the value of `i`. This means `tmp` will hold a character from the alphabet based on the value of `i`.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the new variable `tmp` which is introduced.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is `i + 1`, `tmp` is the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + i)`**
