You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: After processing all `t` test cases, for each test case, the output is either "YES" if `cnt` (the number of sequences of `k` distinct characters) is greater than or equal to `n`, or "NO" followed by a constructed string `ans` if `cnt` is less than `n`. The constructed string `ans` consists of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, concatenated with `tmp` (the last valid character assigned based on `cur`), and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the string `s`. If not, we need to provide a counterexample, i.e., a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.

2. **Checking Subsequences:**
   - The program initializes `cnt` to 0 and `cur` to 0. 
   - It then iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - For each character, it calculates `cur_ss` as the zero-based index of the character in the alphabet.
   - If the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is not set, it sets the bit.
   - If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen in the correct order, so `cnt` is incremented and `cur` is reset to 0.

3. **Determining Output:**
   - If `cnt` is at least `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans` that is not a subsequence of `s`:
     - It initializes `tmp` to an empty string.
     - It constructs `ans` as the string of the `k`-th character repeated `cnt` times.
     - It finds the first character that has not been seen in `cur` and appends it to `tmp`.
     - It appends `tmp` to `ans`.
     - It appends 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times to `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

### Issues in the Program
- **Incorrect Approach to Counting Subsequences:** The program attempts to count how many times all `k` characters have appeared in order in the string `s`, but this does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.
- **Incorrect Construction of Counterexample:** The construction of the counterexample string `ans` is flawed. The program does not ensure that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Correctness
Given the above analysis, the program is not correct because it does not properly check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s` and it does not correctly construct a counterexample string.

**Correctness: False**
