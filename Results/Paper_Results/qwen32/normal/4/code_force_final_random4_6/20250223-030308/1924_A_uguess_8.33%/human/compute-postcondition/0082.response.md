Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet if `cnt` is 0, otherwise the last valid character assigned, and `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.**
