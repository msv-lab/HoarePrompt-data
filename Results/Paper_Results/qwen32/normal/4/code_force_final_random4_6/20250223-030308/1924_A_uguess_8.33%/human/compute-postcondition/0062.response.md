The code snippet provided increments the variable `cnt` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `cnt` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of the character `ss` in the alphabet
- `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, indicating that all the first `k` bits are set to 1
- `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet
- `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.

After the execution of `cnt += 1`:
- `cnt` is now 1
- All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 0, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of the character `ss` in the alphabet, `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet, `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.**
