Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is 0. The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` was either originally zero and `cur` was updated to `1 << cur_ss`, or it was already non-zero and `cur` remained unchanged. `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. The current value of `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`.**
