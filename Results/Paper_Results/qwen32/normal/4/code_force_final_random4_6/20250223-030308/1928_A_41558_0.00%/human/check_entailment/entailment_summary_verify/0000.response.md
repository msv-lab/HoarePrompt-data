Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Description Recap
Bob wants to cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and then rearrange these smaller rectangles to form a different rectangle. The rectangles are considered the same if they differ only by a 90-degree rotation. The task is to determine if Bob can form another rectangle or not.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
3. It checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd and if one is exactly half of the other.
4. If both conditions are met, it prints "NO".
5. Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Function Summary Recap
The function summary states that the function prints "YES" if neither dimension is odd and they are not such that one is exactly half of the other; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Original Assessment Recap
The original assessment claims that the provided program is incorrect and provides several counterexamples where the program's logic fails.

### Detailed Analysis
1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - **Both dimensions are odd**: If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and rearrange them into a different rectangle because the resulting smaller rectangles would also have odd dimensions, and there would be no way to form a different rectangle with integer sides.
   - **One dimension is exactly half of the other**: If \(a = 2b\) or \(b = 2a\), cutting the rectangle along the longer side will result in two rectangles of dimensions \(b \times b\) or \(a \times a\), which cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

2. **Counterexamples**:
   - **3x4 Rectangle**: The program prints "YES" because neither dimension is odd and one is not exactly half of the other. Indeed, cutting a 3x4 rectangle into two 3x2 rectangles can form a 2x6 rectangle, which is different from 3x4.
   - **5x4 Rectangle**: The program prints "YES" because neither dimension is odd and one is not exactly half of the other. Indeed, cutting a 5x4 rectangle into two 5x2 rectangles can form a 2x10 rectangle, which is different from 5x4.
   - **6x3 Rectangle**: The program prints "NO" because one dimension is exactly half of the other. Cutting a 6x3 rectangle into two 3x3 rectangles can form a 3x6 rectangle, which is different from 6x3.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct because the provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it incorrectly prints "NO" for cases where one dimension is exactly half of the other, but rearranging the smaller rectangles can still form a different rectangle.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
