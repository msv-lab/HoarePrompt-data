The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The value of `n` does not change.

So, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` is `x`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then `a` and `b` are odd. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even, and either `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a` is true, or neither `a / 2` equals `b` nor `b / 2` equals `a`. `i` is `x + 1` where `x` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

To make this more concrete, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was 2, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then `a` and `b` are odd. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even, and either `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a` is true, or neither `a / 2` equals `b` nor `b / 2` equals `a`. `i` is 3**.

Since we do not have the specific value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then `a` and `b` are odd. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even, and either `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a` is true, or neither `a / 2` equals `b` nor `b / 2` equals `a`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
