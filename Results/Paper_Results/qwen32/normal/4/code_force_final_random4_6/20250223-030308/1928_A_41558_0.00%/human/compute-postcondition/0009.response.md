The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes the conditions and constraints for the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`.

The code is:
```python
print('YES')
```

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
