Let's analyze the program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The program's logic is based on the following conditions:

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'NO' because cutting an odd-sized rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides will always result in two rectangles that cannot form a new rectangle with different dimensions.
2. If `a` is exactly double `b` or `b` is exactly double `a`, it prints 'NO' because cutting the rectangle in such a way will result in two rectangles of dimensions `a/2 x b` or `a x b/2` respectively, and these cannot form a new rectangle with different dimensions.
3. If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'YES' because it implies that the rectangle can be cut in a way that allows the formation of a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Let's verify this logic against the examples provided:

1. **Input:** `1 1`  
   - Both `a` and `b` are odd, so the output is 'NO'. Correct.
2. **Input:** `2 1`  
   - `a` is even and `b` is odd, but `a` is not double `b`, so the output is 'NO'. Correct.
3. **Input:** `2 6`  
   - `a` is even and `b` is even, and `b` is not double `a`, so the output is 'YES'. Correct.
4. **Input:** `3 2`  
   - `a` is odd and `b` is even, but `a` is not double `b`, so the output is 'YES'. Correct.
5. **Input:** `2 2`  
   - `a` and `b` are even, and neither is double the other, so the output is 'YES'. Correct.
6. **Input:** `2 4`  
   - `a` and `b` are even, and `b` is double `a`, so the output is 'NO'. Incorrect based on the problem statement, it should be 'YES'.
7. **Input:** `6 3`  
   - `a` is even and `b` is odd, but `a` is not double `b`, so the output is 'NO'. Correct.

The logic for the condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is incorrect. The condition should be `elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0 and (a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a):` to ensure that both dimensions are even and one is double the other. However, the simpler and correct condition is just `elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0 and (a == 2*b or b == 2*a):` which checks if both dimensions are even and one is double the other.

Thus, the given program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of the condition where one dimension is double the other.

Correctness: **False**
