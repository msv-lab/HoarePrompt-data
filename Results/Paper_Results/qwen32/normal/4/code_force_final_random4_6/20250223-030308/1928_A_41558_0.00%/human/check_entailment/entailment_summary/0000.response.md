### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the program to see if it correctly determines whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it.

The key points to understand are:
1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it is impossible to form a new rectangle because cutting an odd-sized rectangle in half parallel to either side will result in a rectangle with one side having a non-integer length.
2. If one dimension of the rectangle is exactly half of the other, the resulting rectangles after the cut will be two smaller rectangles of the same dimensions, and thus, they can only form the same rectangle when combined, not a new one.
3. In all other cases, it should be possible to form a new rectangle by combining the two resulting rectangles in a different configuration.

Now, let's analyze the provided program:
- The program correctly identifies the first condition where both `a` and `b` are odd and prints 'NO'.
- However, the second condition in the program is incorrect. The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` checks if one dimension is exactly twice the other, but this is not the correct check. Instead, it should check if one dimension is exactly half of the other, which would be `elif a == 2 * b or b == 2 * a`.
- The `else` condition is correct as it covers all other cases where a new rectangle can be formed.

Given the above points, the program is not entirely correct due to the incorrect condition for when one dimension is exactly half of the other.

### Correctness: **False**
