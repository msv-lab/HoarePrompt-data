Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle. Let's analyze the logic:

1. The program checks if both dimensions of the rectangle are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`). If both are odd, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because an odd by odd rectangle can only be cut into two rectangles of size (odd by 1), which cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

2. The program then checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other (`a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a`). If true, it prints 'NO'. This is incorrect. For example, a 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a 4x2 rectangle (which is considered the same as 2x4, but the program should still return 'YES' because the problem asks if he can obtain *some other* rectangle, and 4x2 is indeed a different configuration in terms of cutting and rearranging).

3. If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'YES'. This is generally correct for most cases but fails in the specific cases mentioned above.

To fix the program, we should only consider the case where both dimensions are odd as a 'NO'. For all other cases, the answer should be 'YES' because we can always cut and rearrange the resulting pieces to form a different rectangle.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

This program correctly handles the problem as described.
