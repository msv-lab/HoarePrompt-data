The code snippet `s_a += nums[i]` adds the value of `nums[i]` to `s_a`. Given the initial state, `i` is `i + 1`, meaning `i` has already been incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed. Therefore, the value added to `s_a` is the element at the index `i + 1` in the list `nums`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `s_a` is `s_a + nums[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `i` remains `i + 1` (unchanged from its initial state), and `s_a` is updated to be its previous value plus the value of `nums[i]`.
