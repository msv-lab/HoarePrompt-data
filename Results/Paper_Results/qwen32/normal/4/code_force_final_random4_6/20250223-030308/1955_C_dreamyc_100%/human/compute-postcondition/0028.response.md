The code snippet provided increments the variable `ans` by 1. The values of `i`, `s_a`, `s_b`, `a`, and `nums` are not modified by this code, so they retain their initial state. The only change is the increment in `ans`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `s_a` is `s_a + nums[i]`, `s_b` is `s_b + nums[n - i - 1]`. If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, `ans` is incremented by 1; `ans` is incremented by 1.**
