To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop step by step and how the variables `s_a`, `s_b`, and `ans` evolve.

### Loop Analysis:
- `s_a` accumulates the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `nums`.
- `s_b` accumulates the sum of the last `i+1` elements of `nums`.
- `ans` increments by 1 if `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` (ceiling of `k / 2`).
- `ans` increments by 1 if `s_b` is less than or equal to `b` (floor of `k / 2`).

### Loop Iteration:
- **Iteration 1**: `s_a = nums[0]`, `s_b = nums[n-1]`. `ans` increments based on `s_a <= a` and `s_b <= b`.
- **Iteration 2**: `s_a = nums[0] + nums[1]`, `s_b = nums[n-1] + nums[n-2]`. `ans` increments based on `s_a <= a` and `s_b <= b`.
- **Iteration 3**: `s_a = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2]`, `s_b = nums[n-1] + nums[n-2] + nums[n-3]`. `ans` increments based on `s_a <= a` and `s_b <= b`.

### Final Iteration:
- The loop runs `n` times, so the final iteration will be `i = n-1`.
- `s_a` will be the sum of all elements in `nums` (`sum(nums)`).
- `s_b` will also be the sum of all elements in `nums` (`sum(nums)`).

### Condition Check:
- For `s_a <= a` and `s_b <= b` to be true in the final iteration:
  - `sum(nums) <= a` and `sum(nums) <= b` must hold.
  - However, given that `k < sum(nums)`, it follows that `a < sum(nums)` and `b < sum(nums)`.
  - Therefore, `sum(nums) <= a` and `sum(nums) <= b` will never be true in the final iteration.

### Conclusion:
- In the final iteration, `s_a` and `s_b` will both be `sum(nums)`, which is greater than both `a` and `b`.
- Therefore, `ans` will not increment in the final iteration.

### Output State:
The final value of `ans` will be the sum of all increments from the previous iterations. Since the final iteration does not increment `ans`, the final value of `ans` is the same as after the last iteration where the conditions were met.

Given the initial state and the nature of the loop, the final output state is:

Output State: **ans**

In natural language, the final output state is the value of `ans` after all iterations of the loop have completed, which is the sum of all increments where either `s_a <= a` or `s_b <= b` was true during the iterations.
