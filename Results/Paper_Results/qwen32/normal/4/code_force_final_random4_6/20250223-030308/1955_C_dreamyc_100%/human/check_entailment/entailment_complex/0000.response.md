Reasoning: The given program is not correct based on the problem description and the provided example. The function `func_1` does not correctly determine the number of ships that sink after the Kraken's attack.

The current implementation of `func_1` has several issues:
1. It does not correctly simulate the alternating attack pattern between the first and last ships.
2. The logic for calculating `ans` is flawed. The sums `s_a` and `s_b` are being compared to `a` and `b` respectively, but this comparison does not accurately reflect the number of ships that have been sunk.
3. The function does not account for the fact that once a ship sinks, it is no longer considered in subsequent attacks.

Let's break down the provided example to see why the current implementation fails:

For the first test case:
- `n=4`, `k=5`, `nums=[1, 2, 4, 3]`
- The Kraken attacks as follows:
  1. Attacks the first ship: `nums = [0, 2, 4, 3]` (1 ship sunk)
  2. Attacks the last ship: `nums = [0, 2, 4, 2]` (1 ship sunk)
  3. Attacks the first ship: `nums = [0, 2, 4, 2]` (no additional ship sunk, first ship already sunk)
  4. Attacks the last ship: `nums = [0, 2, 4, 1]` (1 ship sunk)
  5. Attacks the first ship: `nums = [0, 2, 4, 1]` (no additional ship sunk, first ship already sunk)

The correct number of ships sunk is 3, but the function `func_1` does not account for the alternating attack pattern correctly and would likely return an incorrect value.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
