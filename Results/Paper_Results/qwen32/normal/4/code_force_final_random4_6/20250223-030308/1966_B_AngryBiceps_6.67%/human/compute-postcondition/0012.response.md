The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last string in the list `a` to the variable `last_row`. 

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a`, `i` is 1.

After the code execution, `last_row` will be updated to include the last character of the last string in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a`, `i` is 1.**
