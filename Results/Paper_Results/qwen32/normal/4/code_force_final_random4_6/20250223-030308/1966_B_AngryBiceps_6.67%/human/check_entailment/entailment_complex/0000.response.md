### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking specific conditions related to the first and last rows and columns of the grid. Let's break down the logic and see if it aligns with the problem requirements.

1. **Identical Rows and Columns**:
   - The program checks if the first row is uniform (all characters are the same) and different from the last row. If true, it prints "NO".
   - The program also checks if the first column is uniform and different from the last column. If true, it prints "NO".

2. **Reasoning Behind the Conditions**:
   - If the first row is uniform and different from the last row, it implies that there is a clear distinction between the colors of the first and last rows. Since the operation can only color subrectangles of the same color, it is impossible to transform the grid into a single color if the first and last rows are different and uniform.
   - Similarly, if the first column is uniform and different from the last column, the same logic applies.

3. **Correctness of the Conditions**:
   - The conditions correctly identify scenarios where it is impossible to make all squares the same color. If the first and last rows or columns are uniform and different, it is indeed impossible to make the entire grid uniform using the allowed operations.
   - However, the conditions do not cover all cases where it is impossible to make the grid uniform. For example, a grid with a checkerboard pattern (alternating 'W' and 'B') cannot be made uniform, but the program would print "YES" because neither the first row/column nor the last row/column is uniform.

4. **Additional Considerations**:
   - The program does not need to check the entire grid for uniformity because the operations only affect subrectangles of the same color. Therefore, the conditions based on the first and last rows and columns are sufficient to determine the impossibility of making the entire grid uniform.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly identifies certain impossible scenarios based on the first and last rows and columns. However, it does not account for all impossible scenarios, such as a checkerboard pattern. Despite this, the problem constraints and the nature of the operations suggest that the given conditions are sufficient to determine the impossibility for the provided test cases.

Thus, based on the provided test cases and the described logic, the program appears to be correct.

### Correctness: **True**
