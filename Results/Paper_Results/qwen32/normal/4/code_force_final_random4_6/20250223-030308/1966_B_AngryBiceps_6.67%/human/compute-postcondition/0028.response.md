The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This means that the values of `n` and `m` will be updated based on the new input, and the other variables will remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by subsequent code (which is not present in the given snippet).

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i` will remain the same. The only variables that will change are `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string containing the first characters of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together, `last_row` is a string containing the last characters of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`.**
