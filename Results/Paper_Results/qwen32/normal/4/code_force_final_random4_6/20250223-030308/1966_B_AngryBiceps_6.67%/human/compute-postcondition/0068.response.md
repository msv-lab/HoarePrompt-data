The code snippet appends a new input string to the list `a`. This affects the list `a` by increasing its length by one. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing three input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a`, `i` is 2**.
