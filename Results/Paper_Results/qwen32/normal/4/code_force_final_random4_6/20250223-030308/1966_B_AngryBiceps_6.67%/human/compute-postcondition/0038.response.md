The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last string in the list `a` to the `first_row` variable. 

Given the initial state, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, and `a[-1][0]` is the first character of the newly appended string in `a`. 

After executing the code, `first_row` will now be the concatenation of its original value and the first character of the newly appended string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements (the original string and the newly appended string), `first_row` is the concatenation of the original first character of the string in `a` and the first character of the newly appended string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`, `i` is `n`.**
