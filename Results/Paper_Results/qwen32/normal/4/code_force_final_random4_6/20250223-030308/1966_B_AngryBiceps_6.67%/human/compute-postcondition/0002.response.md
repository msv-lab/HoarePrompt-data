The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is an empty list.**
