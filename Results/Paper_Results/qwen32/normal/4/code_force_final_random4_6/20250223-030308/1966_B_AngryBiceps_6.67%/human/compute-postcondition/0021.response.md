Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string containing the first characters of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together, `last_row` is a string containing the last characters of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`. The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is equal to 1 and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`. Either the length of the set of characters in `a[0]` is not equal to 1, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.**
