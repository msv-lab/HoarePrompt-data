The code snippet appends the first character of the newest input string (which is `a[-1]`) to `first_row`. Therefore, `first_row` now includes the first character of the original string in `a`, the first character of the newly appended string in `a`, and the first character of the newest input string in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing three elements (the original string, the newly appended string, and the newest input string), `first_row` is the concatenation of the original first character of the string in `a`, the first character of the newly appended string in `a`, and the first character of the newest input string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the newly appended string in `a`, `i` is 0.**
