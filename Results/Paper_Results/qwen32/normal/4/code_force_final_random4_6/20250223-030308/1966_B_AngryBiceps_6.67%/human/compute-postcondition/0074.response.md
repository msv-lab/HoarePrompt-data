Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string of length `n` consisting of the first characters of each string in `a`, `last_row` is a string of length `n` consisting of the last characters of each string in `a`, `i` is `n-1`. Either the length of the set of characters in the first string `a[0]` is not equal to 1, or the first string `a[0]` is equal to the last string `a[-1]`.**
