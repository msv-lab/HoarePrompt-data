The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state of `t` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state will include the new values of `n` and `m` and the unchanged value of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input.**
