Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string of length `n` consisting of the first characters of each string in `a`, and `last_row` is a string of length `n` consisting of the last characters of each string in `a`. `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` consists of identical characters and is not equal to the last string in `a`, then the condition is met as specified in the if part. Otherwise, either the first string in `a` does not consist of identical characters or it is equal to the last string in `a`. Additionally, if the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1, then `first_row` is equal to `last_row`. Otherwise, the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1.**
