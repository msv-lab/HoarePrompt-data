The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last string in the list `a` to the `last_row` string. Given that `a` is a list containing one input string, `a[-1]` refers to this single string, and `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last character of this string.

Since `last_row` was initially an empty string, after the operation, `last_row` will hold the last character of the string in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`, `i` is 0.**
