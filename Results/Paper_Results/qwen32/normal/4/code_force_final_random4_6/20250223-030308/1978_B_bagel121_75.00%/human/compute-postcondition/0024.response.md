Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`; `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `p2` is updated to be `(n - k) * a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
