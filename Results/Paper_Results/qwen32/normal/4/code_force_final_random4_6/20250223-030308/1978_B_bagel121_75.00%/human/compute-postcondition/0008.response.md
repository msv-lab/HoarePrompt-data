The code snippet assigns a new value to `p2` based on the expression `(n - k) * a`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a` are already defined in the initial state. The other variables (`t`, `b`, `ans`) are not affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input, `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, `p2` is `(n - k) * a`**.
