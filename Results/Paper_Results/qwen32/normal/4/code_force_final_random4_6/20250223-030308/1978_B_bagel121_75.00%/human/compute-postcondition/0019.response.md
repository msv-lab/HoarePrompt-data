The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, so it will still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `a >= b`, the program does not modify any additional variables. Otherwise, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**
