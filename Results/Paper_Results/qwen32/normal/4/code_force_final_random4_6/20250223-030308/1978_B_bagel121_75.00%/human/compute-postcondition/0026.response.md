Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `a >= b`, the program does not modify `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. Otherwise, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`; `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.***
