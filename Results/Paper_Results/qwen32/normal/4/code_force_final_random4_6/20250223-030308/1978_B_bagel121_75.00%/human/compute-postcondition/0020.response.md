The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. No further modifications are made to the variables `t`, `a`, or `b` in this snippet. The variables `k`, `ans`, and `p2` are not yet defined or modified by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, except that `n`, `a`, and `b` have been assigned specific values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.**
