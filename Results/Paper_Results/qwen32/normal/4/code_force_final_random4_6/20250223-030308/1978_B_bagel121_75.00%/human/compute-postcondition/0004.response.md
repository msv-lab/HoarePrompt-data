The `print(n * a)` statement will print the product of the variables `n` and `a`. According to the initial state, `n` and `a` are integers read from the input, and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `a` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `n * a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the product of `n` and `a`.

Output: **n * a (where n and a are integers read from the input)**
