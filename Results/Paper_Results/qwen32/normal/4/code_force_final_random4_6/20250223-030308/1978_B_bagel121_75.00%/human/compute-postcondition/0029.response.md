Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates a sum involving the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, and prints the sum of this calculated value and `(n - k) * a`. After processing all test cases, it outputs the result for each.**
