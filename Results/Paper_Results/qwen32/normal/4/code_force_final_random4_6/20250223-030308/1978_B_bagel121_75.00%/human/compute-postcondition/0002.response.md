The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer greater than 0, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, with `t` indicating the number of test cases.

After executing the code, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be updated to the integers provided in the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.**
