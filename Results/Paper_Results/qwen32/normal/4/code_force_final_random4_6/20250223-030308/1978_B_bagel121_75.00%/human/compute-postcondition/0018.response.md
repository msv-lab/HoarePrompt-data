Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `a >= b`, the program does not modify any additional variables. Otherwise, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**
