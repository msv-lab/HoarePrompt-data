### Reasoning:

To determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, we need to analyze the conditions under which Bob can achieve his goal.

1. **If `n <= k`**: Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon to the same color because he can repaint up to `k` parts, and `k` is at least as large as the number of parts `n`. Therefore, the answer is `NO`.

2. **If `n > k`**: Bob can only repaint up to `k` parts. To ensure Bob cannot make all parts the same color, Alice needs to distribute the colors in such a way that no single color appears in more than `k` parts. If Alice can distribute the colors so that the most frequent color appears in fewer than `n - k` parts, Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

3. **Math.ceil(n / m)**: This represents the minimum number of parts that must have the same color if the ribbon is painted using `m` colors as evenly as possible. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means that even if Bob repaints `k` parts, he cannot make all parts the same color because the largest group of parts of the same color is already less than `n - k`.

The logic in the provided code correctly implements this reasoning:
- If `n <= k`, it prints `NO` because Bob can repaint all parts.
- If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it prints `NO` because even with optimal distribution, Bob can still make all parts the same color by repainting `k` parts.
- Otherwise, it prints `YES`, meaning Alice can distribute the colors in a way that prevents Bob from making all parts the same color.
