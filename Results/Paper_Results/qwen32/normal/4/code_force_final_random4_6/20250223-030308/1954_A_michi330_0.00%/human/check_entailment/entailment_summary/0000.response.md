### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts of the ribbon the same color by repainting at most `k` parts.

Let's analyze the conditions under which Alice can achieve this:

1. **If `n <= k`**: Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon to the same color, so Alice cannot prevent this. Hence, the answer is 'NO'.
2. **If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`**: This condition is a bit trickier. `math.ceil(n / m)` represents the minimum number of parts that must have the same color if the ribbon is painted optimally by Alice (i.e., the most even distribution of colors). If the number of parts that need to be repainted to make all parts the same color is less than `k`, then Bob can achieve his goal. Therefore, the answer is 'NO' in this case as well.
3. **Otherwise**: If neither of the above conditions is met, Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot repaint all parts to the same color with at most `k` repainting actions. Thus, the answer is 'YES'.

The provided program correctly implements these conditions. It checks if either `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` and prints 'NO' if either condition is true. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Correctness:
