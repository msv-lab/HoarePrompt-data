### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts of the ribbon the same color after repainting at most `k` parts.

Let's analyze the conditions in the given program:

1. **Condition: `n <= k`**
   - If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon to the same color, no matter how Alice paints it initially. Therefore, the answer should be `NO`.

2. **Condition: `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`**
   - This condition determines if Bob can make all parts the same color after Alice has painted them.
   - `n / m` is the average number of parts per color if the parts are distributed as evenly as possible.
   - `math.ceil(n / m)` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n / m`, representing the maximum number of parts that can be of the same color if the parts are distributed as evenly as possible.
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is the number of parts that need to be repainted to make all parts the same color if they are initially painted in the most balanced way.
   - If this number is less than `k`, Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the answer should be `NO`.

3. **Otherwise:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting at most `k` parts. Therefore, the answer should be `YES`.

The given program correctly implements this logic. It checks the two conditions and prints `NO` if either condition is true, otherwise it prints `YES`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
