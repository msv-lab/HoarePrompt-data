Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It then determines if it is possible to repaint up to `k` parts of a ribbon consisting of `n` parts to make all parts the same color, given `m` colors. It prints 'YES' if it is possible, otherwise 'NO'.**
