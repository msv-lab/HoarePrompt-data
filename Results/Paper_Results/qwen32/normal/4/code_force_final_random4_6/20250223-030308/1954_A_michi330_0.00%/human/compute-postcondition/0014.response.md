The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `itest` and `t` remain unchanged. The conditions involving `n`, `m`, and `k` are not evaluated or changed by this code snippet.

Output State: **`itest` is 2, `t` is at least 3, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.**
