Postcondition: **`itest` is 2, `t` is at least 3, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input. If `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, the condition in the if statement holds. Otherwise, the condition in the else part holds, but since the else part does not alter any variables, the state remains the same as the precondition.**
