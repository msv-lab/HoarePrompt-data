Output State: **`itest` is `t-1`, `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, the program has printed either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case have been read from the input and are not altered by the loop.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop variable `itest` will have reached `t-1`, which means it has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, the program has evaluated the conditions and printed 'NO' if either `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`. Otherwise, it printed 'YES'. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case have been read from the input and remain unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.
