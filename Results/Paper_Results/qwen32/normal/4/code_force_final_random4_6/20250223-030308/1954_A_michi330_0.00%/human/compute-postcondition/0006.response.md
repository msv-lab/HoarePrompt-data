Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation step by step.

### Initial State:
- `itest` is 0.
- `t` is at least 1.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `n` is greater than `k`.
- `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print('Yes')` statement directly prints the string `'Yes'`.
- There are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement that depend on the values of `itest`, `t`, `n`, `m`, or `k`.
- The precondition provides information about the constraints on `n`, `m`, and `k`, but these constraints do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print('Yes')` statement will output the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `itest`, `t`, `n`, `m`, or `k`, as long as they satisfy the given constraints.

Output: **Yes**
