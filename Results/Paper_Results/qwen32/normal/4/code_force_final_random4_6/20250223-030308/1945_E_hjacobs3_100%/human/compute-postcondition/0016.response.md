The value of `l` is updated to be equal to `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. `array` is still a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is still an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is still greater than 1, `r` is still at least `l + 2` (which now means `r` is at least `mid + 2`), and `mid` remains `(l + r) // 2`.

Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is at least `mid + 2`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`, `l` is `mid`.**
