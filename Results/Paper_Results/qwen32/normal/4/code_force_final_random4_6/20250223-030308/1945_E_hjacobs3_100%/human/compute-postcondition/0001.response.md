The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `l` and the value `n` to the variable `r`. The values of `array`, `find`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, where n is the length of the array, and `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= n; `n` is the length of the array; `l` is 0; `r` is n.**
