Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to rearrange a permutation `p` of length `n` such that after performing at most 2 swaps, a binary search algorithm will correctly identify the index `l` where `p[l]` equals `x`. The binary search algorithm is described in the problem statement, and it relies on the fact that `l` should point to `x` at the end of the algorithm.

### Program Analysis
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution. Here's a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization of `l` and `r`**:
   - The program initializes `l` and `r` as `0` and `n` respectively, which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop correctly implements the binary search algorithm, updating `l` and `r` based on the value of `array[mid]`.

3. **Checking the Result**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if `l` is the index of `x` in the array.
   - If `l` is not the index of `x`, the program prints `1` and suggests a swap to move `x` to the `l` position.
   - If `l` is already the index of `x`, the program prints `0`.

### Issues in the Program
- **Incorrect Swap Logic**:
  - The program only considers a single swap if `l` is not the index of `x`. However, the problem guarantees that at most 2 swaps are sufficient, and the program does not attempt to use the second swap if the first swap is insufficient.
  - The program does not handle cases where more than one swap is needed to ensure that the binary search will correctly identify `x`.

- **Output Format**:
  - The function `func_1` is supposed to return the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps, but the current implementation prints the number of swaps and the indices directly, which is not consistent with the problem's requirement to return these values.

### Correctness
Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all cases. Specifically, it does not handle cases where more than one swap is needed and does not correctly format the output as required by the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
