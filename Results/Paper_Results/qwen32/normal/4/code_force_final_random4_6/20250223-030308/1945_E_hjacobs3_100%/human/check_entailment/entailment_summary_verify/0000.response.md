### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Input**: A permutation `p` of size `n` and an integer `x` to find.
2. **Objective**: Rearrange the permutation using up to 2 swaps such that after applying a binary search, the element at position `l` is `x`.
3. **Binary Search**: Starts with `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`. It repeatedly calculates `m = floor((r + l) / 2)`, and if `p[m] <= x`, it sets `l = m`; otherwise, it sets `r = m`. The loop ends when `r - l = 1`.
4. **Output**: The number of swaps (0 to 2) and the indices of the swapped elements.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
The code reads the input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` to handle the logic of determining the swaps. The function `func_1` performs the following:
1. Initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n`.
2. Executes the binary search to find the largest index `l` such that `array[l] <= find`.
3. Checks if the current `l` is the index of `find` in the array.
4. If not, it prints `1` and returns a list of two strings representing the indices to swap.

#### Issues with the Code:
1. **Single Swap Limitation**: The code only performs a single swap if `l` is not the index of `find`. However, the problem requires that the binary search should correctly identify `x` at position `l` after up to two swaps.
2. **Binary Search on Unsorted Array**: The binary search algorithm assumes a sorted array. A single swap may not be sufficient to sort the array or position `x` correctly.
3. **Incorrect Handling of Swaps**: The function `func_1` does not guarantee that the array will be in a state where the binary search will correctly identify `x` at position `l` after one swap.

#### Example Test Case:
Consider the test case:
```
1
5 3
5 4 3 1 2
```
- The correct output involves two swaps: 
  - Swap elements at positions 1 and 3 to get `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`.
  - Swap elements at positions 4 and 5 to get `[3, 4, 5, 2, 1]`.
- After these swaps, the binary search will correctly identify `3` at position `l`.

However, the provided code will only perform one swap and will not handle this case correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem as it only attempts a single swap and does not ensure that the binary search will correctly identify `x` at position `l` after up to two swaps. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
