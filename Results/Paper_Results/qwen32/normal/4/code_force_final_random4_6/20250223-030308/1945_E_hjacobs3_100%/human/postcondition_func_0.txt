The function takes an array, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and an integer `find` such that 1 <= `find` <= n. It returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the value of `l + 1`, where `l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`, and the second string is the value of the index of `find` in `array` plus 1. If `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints 0.
