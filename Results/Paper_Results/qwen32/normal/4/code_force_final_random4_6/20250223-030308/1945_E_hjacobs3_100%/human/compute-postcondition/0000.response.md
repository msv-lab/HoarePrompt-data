Output State: **array is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, where n is the length of the array, and find is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n; n is the length of the array.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the length of the `array`. The other variables, `array` and `find`, remain unchanged.
