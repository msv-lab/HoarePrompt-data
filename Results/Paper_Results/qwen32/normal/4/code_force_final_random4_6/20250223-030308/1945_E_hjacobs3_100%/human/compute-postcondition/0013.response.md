Postcondition: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the length of the array; `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`; `n` must be greater than 1; `r` is at least `l + 2`; `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`. If `array[mid] <= find`, then `l` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid`.**
