The value of `l` is updated to be equal to `mid`. The other variables (`array`, `find`, `n`, `r`, `mid`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the length of the array; `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`; `n` must be greater than 1; `r` must be at least `l + 2`; `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`; `l` is `mid`.**
