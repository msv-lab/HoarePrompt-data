The value of `r` is updated to be equal to `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is now equal to `mid`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`.

Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is `mid`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`.**
