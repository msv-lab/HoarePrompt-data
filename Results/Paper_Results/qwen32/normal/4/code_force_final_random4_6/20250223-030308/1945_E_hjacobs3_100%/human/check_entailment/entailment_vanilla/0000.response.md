Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
- We can perform at most 2 swaps on the permutation to make sure that after performing a binary search, the element at position `l` is equal to `x`.
- The binary search operates on the array until `r - l = 1`, and at the end, `p_l` should be equal to `x`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (size of permutation) and `x` (number to be found).
   - It then reads the permutation `array`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to determine the swaps needed to ensure that after binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.
   - The function initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n` (length of the array).
   - It then performs the binary search.
   - If the final `l` is not equal to the index of `x` in the array, it suggests one swap between `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1`.
   - If `l` is already the index of `x`, it suggests no swaps.

### Issues with the Provided Program:
- **Binary Search Implementation:** The binary search is implemented correctly, but the program assumes that the array is sorted, which it is not. The binary search will not behave as expected on an unsorted array.
- **Swap Logic:** The logic for determining the swap is flawed. The program suggests a swap only if `l` is not the index of `x`, but this does not guarantee that `p_l` will be equal to `x` after the binary search.
- **Output Format:** The function is supposed to return a list of operations, but it prints the output directly. The main loop expects a list of strings to be returned, which is not the case here.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not correct. It does not ensure that after performing at most 2 swaps, the binary search will result in `p_l` being equal to `x`. The logic for determining the swaps is insufficient, and the output format is also incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
