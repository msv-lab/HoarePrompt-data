Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the sum of increments from all iterations (either 1 or 2 per iteration), and `m` is `n - num`. If `m` equals 0, the state remains as described without any changes to `dp`. If `m` is 1, the state remains as described without any changes to `dp`. If `m` is 6, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with elements `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `dp[5]` is 81, and `dp[6]` is 331. For any other value of `m` (neither 0 nor 6), the state remains as described without any changes to `dp`.**
