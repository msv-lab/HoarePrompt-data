The value of `num` is incremented by 1. Given that `num` was either 2, 3, or 4, it will now be either 3, 4, or 5, respectively. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input where `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 3, 4, or 5, `m` is equal to `n - num`, `c` and `r` are new integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input where `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 3, 4, or 5, `m` is equal to `n - num`, `c` and `r` are new integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1.**
