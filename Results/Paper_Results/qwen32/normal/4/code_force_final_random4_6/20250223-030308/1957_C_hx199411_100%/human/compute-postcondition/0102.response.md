The provided code snippet updates the values of `c` and `r` based on the input. The initial state values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this particular line of code. The new values of `c` and `r` are obtained from the input and replace the previous values of `c` and `r`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `c` and `r` are the new integers obtained from the input, If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 2 and `m` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `num` is 4 and `m` is `n - 2`. `i` is 4.**
