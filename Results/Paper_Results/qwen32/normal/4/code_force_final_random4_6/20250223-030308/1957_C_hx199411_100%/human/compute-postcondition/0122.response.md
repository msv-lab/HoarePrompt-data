Initial State: `t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the total increment based on the `c` and `r` values, `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, and `dp[4]` which is `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `i` is 4

The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` where `i` is 4. So, `dp[4]` is recalculated as:
```
dp[4] = (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[4] = (7 + 3 * 3 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[4] = (7 + 18) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[4] = 25 % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[4] = 25
```

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the total increment based on the `c` and `r` values, `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, and `dp[4]` which is 25, `i` is 4**
