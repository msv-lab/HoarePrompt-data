Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space; `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`; `i` is equal to `k`; `m` is equal to `n - num`. The current value of `m` is 0.**
