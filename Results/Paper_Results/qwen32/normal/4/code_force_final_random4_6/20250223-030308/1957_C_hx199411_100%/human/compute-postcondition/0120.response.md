Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the total increment based on the `c` and `r` values, `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, and `dp[4]` which is `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, `i` is 4**

In natural language, the output state means that the value of `dp[4]` has been updated to the result of the expression `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described.
