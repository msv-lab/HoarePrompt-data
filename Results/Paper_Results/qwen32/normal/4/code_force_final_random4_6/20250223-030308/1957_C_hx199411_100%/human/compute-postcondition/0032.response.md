The code snippet `dp[2] = 3` updates the value at index 2 of the list `dp` to 3. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space; `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`; `i` is equal to `k`; `m` is equal to `n - num`; `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1; `dp` is a list with `m + 1` elements, all initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3.**
