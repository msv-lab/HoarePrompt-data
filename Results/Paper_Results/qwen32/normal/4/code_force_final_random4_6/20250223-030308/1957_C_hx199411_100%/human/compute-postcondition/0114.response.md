The code snippet initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the creation of the `dp` list and the preservation of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the total increment based on the `c` and `r` values, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**
