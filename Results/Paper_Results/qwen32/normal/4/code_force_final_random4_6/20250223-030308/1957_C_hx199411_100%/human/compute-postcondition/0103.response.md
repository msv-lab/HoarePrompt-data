Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `c` and `r` are the new integers obtained from the input, If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 3 and `m` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `num` is 5 and `m` is `n - 2`. `i` is 4.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `c` equals `r`, `num` becomes 3; otherwise, `num` becomes 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
