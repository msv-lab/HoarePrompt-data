The given code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the previous values in the `dp` list. The specific value of `dp[i]` is calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the sum of increments from all iterations (either 1 or 2 per iteration), `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` which is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**.
