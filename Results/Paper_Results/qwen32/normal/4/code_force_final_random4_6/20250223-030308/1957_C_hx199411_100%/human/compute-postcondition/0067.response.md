Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is initialized to 0.
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
- `num` is the sum of increments from all iterations (either 1 or 2 per iteration).
- `m` is defined as `n - num`.
- It is explicitly stated that `m` equals 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement in the code snippet will print the integer `1` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, or `m`. The value of `m` being 0 does not affect the execution of this print statement.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
