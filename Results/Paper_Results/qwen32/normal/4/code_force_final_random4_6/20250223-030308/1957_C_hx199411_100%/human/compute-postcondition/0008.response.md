Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space, and `k` must be greater than 0; `num` is 1; `c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, where `c` is the first integer and `r` is the second integer separated by a space, and `c` equals `r`.**

In simple terms, the variable `num` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
