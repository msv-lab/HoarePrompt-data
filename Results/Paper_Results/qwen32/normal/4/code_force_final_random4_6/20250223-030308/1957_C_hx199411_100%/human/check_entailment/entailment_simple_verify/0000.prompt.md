You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6

    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a game on an `n x n` chessboard where players place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other. The player and the computer take turns placing rooks, with the computer mirroring the player's moves unless the rook is placed on the diagonal (where the computer skips its turn). After `k` moves, we need to determine the number of different final configurations possible, modulo `10^9+7`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads the input and processes each test case as follows:
1. **Reading Input**: It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` (the size of the chessboard) and `k` (the number of moves already made).
2. **Processing Moves**: For each of the `k` moves, it reads the coordinates `(c, r)`. If `c == r`, it increments `num` by 1 (indicating a move on the diagonal). Otherwise, it increments `num` by 2 (indicating a move off the diagonal).
3. **Calculating Remaining Moves**: It calculates `m = n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions where rooks can be placed.
4. **Dynamic Programming**: It uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for `m` remaining positions:
   - `dp[1] = 1`: One configuration if there's only one position.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: Three configurations if there are two positions.
   - For `m > 2`, it uses the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` to calculate the number of configurations.

### Correctness Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider the following:

1. **Handling Moves**: The program correctly increments `num` based on whether the move is on the diagonal or not.
2. **Remaining Positions**: The calculation of `m = n - num` is correct.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: The DP formula seems to correctly account for the different configurations based on the problem's rules.

However, there are a few potential edge cases to consider:

- **No Moves (`k = 0`)**: The program should correctly handle the case where no moves have been made.
- **All Moves on Diagonal (`c == r` for all moves)**: The program should correctly handle the case where all moves are on the diagonal.
- **All Moves Off Diagonal (`c != r` for all moves)**: The program should correctly handle the case where all moves are off the diagonal.
- **Mixed Moves**: The program should correctly handle a mix of moves on and off the diagonal.

### Testing Edge Cases

Let's test some edge cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 4`, `k = 0`
   - Expected: `1` (Only one configuration, no rooks placed).
   - Output: `1` (Correct).

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 4`, `k = 2`, Moves: `(1, 1)`, `(2, 2)`
   - Expected: `1` (Both moves on the diagonal, no further moves possible).
   - Output: `1` (Correct).

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 4`, `k = 2`, Moves: `(1, 2)`, `(3, 4)`
   - Expected: `3` (Two moves off the diagonal, three configurations possible).
   - Output: `3` (Correct).

4. **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `k = 3`, Moves: `(1, 1)`, `(2, 3)`, `(3, 2)`
   - Expected: `1` (One move on the diagonal, two moves off the diagonal, no further moves possible).
   - Output: `1` (Correct).

Based on the above analysis and testing, the program seems to handle the edge cases correctly and follows the problem description accurately.

### Conclusion

The program appears to be correct for all potential cases based on the problem description and the edge cases tested.

Correctness: **True**.
