The code snippet `num += 2` increases the value of `num` by 2. According to the initial state, `num` is set to 2 if `c` equals `r`, and 4 otherwise. Therefore, after adding 2, `num` will be 4 if `c` equals `r`, or 6 if `c` does not equal `r`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `i`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space, and `k` must be greater than 0; `c` and `r` are new integers obtained from the latest input, where `c` is the first integer and `r` is the second integer separated by a space; `i` is `i + 1`; `num` is 4 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 6.**
