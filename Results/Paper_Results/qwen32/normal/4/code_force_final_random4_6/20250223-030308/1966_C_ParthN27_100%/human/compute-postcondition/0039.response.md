Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is the length of `s`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended to it, `i` is either 1 if `n` is 2, or the last index reached before the loop ended, and `ans` is either 0 or 1. If `n` is 2, `i` is 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` indicates whether there are differences between consecutive elements in `s`: `ans` is 1 if there are differences, and `ans` is 0 if there are no differences.**
