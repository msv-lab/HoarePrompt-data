The code snippet `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ans` and `1`. Given that `ans` is initially `1`, the result of `1 ^ 1` is `0`. This means that `ans` will be updated to `0`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `i`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with a `0` prepended to it, `i` is `n-1`, and `ans` is 0. Additionally, the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is 1 or less.**
