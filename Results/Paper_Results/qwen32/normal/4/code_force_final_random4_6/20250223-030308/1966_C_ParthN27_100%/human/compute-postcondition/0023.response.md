Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended to it, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 0, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is 1 or less.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is changed by the XOR operation `ans ^= 1`. Given that the initial value of `ans` is 1, the result of `1 ^ 1` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
