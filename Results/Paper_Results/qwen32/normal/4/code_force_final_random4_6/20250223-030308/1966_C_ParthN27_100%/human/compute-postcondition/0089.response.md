The code snippet `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the array `arr` to the set `s`. The value of `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, but this does not affect the current value of `i` used in the code snippet. The precondition `n` must be greater than `i + 1` is still valid after the code has been executed, as the value of `n` is not modified.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` contains `arr[i]`**.
