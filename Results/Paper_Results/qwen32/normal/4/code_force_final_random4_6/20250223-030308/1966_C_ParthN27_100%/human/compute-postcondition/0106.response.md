Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the length of the sorted list `s` which contains unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended and must be greater than 2, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside.
