The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`
- `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has just been incremented by 1)
- `s` contains `arr[i]` (though `s` and `arr` are not part of the loop head, we note this for completeness)

For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`. Since `i` has just been incremented, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**
