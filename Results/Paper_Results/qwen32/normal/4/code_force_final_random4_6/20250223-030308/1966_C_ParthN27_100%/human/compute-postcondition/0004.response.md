The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, and `s` is an empty set. These do not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, and `i` will be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is an empty set, `i` is 0**
