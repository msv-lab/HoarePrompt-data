The code snippet `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` and `i` is `i + 1`. This means `i` has been incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed.

Given this, the value of `i` is now `i + 1`, and the element `arr[i]` is added to the set `s`. The precondition `n` must be greater than `i + 1` remains valid after the code execution, as the code does not change the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` contains `arr[i]`**.
