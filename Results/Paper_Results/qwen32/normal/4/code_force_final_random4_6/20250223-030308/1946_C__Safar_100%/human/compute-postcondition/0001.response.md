Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree with n vertices, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, stack is `[(1, 1)]`, visited is an empty set.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new variable `visited` as an empty set. All other variables (`A`, `g`, `k`, and `stack`) retain their initial values.
