The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `root`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop statement:
```
for i in range(2, root + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken on a value, and `root` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `root`.

To proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The value of `root` does not change within the loop, as it is determined by the initial value of `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^6)
- `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^6)
- `ans` is `n + (n + i) // cnt`
- `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`
- `cnt` is `i * i`

The only variable to be adjusted for the next iteration is `i`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^6); `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^6); `ans` is `n + (n + i) // cnt`; `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`; `cnt` is `i * i`; `i` is `i + 1`**
