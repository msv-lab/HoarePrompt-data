The code snippet provided updates the value of `cnt` to `i * i`. No other variables in the code snippet are modified.

Given the initial state, the value of `cnt` was `i * i`. After the execution of the code snippet, `cnt` is recalculated as `i * i`, which means its value remains the same since it is redefined with the same expression.

Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state except for the explicit reassignment of `cnt`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^6); `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^6); `ans` is `n + (n + i) // cnt + (n + (i + 1)) // (i * i + 2 * i + 1)`; `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`; `cnt` is `i * i`; `i` is `i + 2`**
