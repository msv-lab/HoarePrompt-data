Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly, but it processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6). For each test case, it returns a value, which is not specified in the provided output description. The function handles up to `t` test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^6.**
