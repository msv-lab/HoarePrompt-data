### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Mismatch in Input Parameters**:
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers, `n` and `k`, but the problem description specifies `n` and `m`. This mismatch suggests that the code does not align with the problem requirements.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic inside `func_1` involves calculating a value based on square roots and integer divisions, which does not match the problem requirements. The problem requires iterating over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Lack of Pair Checking**:
   - The code does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges. Instead, it performs a different calculation that is unrelated to the problem.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\). The output should be `3`. However, the provided code will not produce this output because it does not correctly implement the required logic.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` does not iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it performs a different calculation that is unrelated to the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
