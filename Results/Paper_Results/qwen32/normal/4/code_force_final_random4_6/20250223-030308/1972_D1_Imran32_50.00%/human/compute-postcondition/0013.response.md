The given initial state describes a calculation that is supposed to be stored in a variable `ans`. However, the variable `ans` is not explicitly defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot directly determine the value of `ans` as it is not explicitly calculated or assigned.

However, we can describe what the expression `n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1))` represents.

The expression calculates:
1. `n` (which is an integer).
2. A sum of the integer division results of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each `i` in the range from 2 to the integer part of the square root of `n` (inclusive).

Given that `ans` is not defined in the initial state, the `print(ans)` statement would result in a `NameError` if executed as is, because `ans` is not recognized in the current scope.

Since the task is to determine what will be printed, and `ans` is not defined, the most precise description we can provide is that there will be an error. However, if we assume that `ans` is supposed to hold the value of the expression provided, we can describe what that value would be.

Let's assume `ans` is meant to hold the value of the expression:
```
ans = n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1))
```

Then the output would be the value of this expression.

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1)))**
