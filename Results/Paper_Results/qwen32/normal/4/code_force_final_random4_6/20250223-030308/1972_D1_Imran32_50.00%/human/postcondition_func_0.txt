The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a single positive integer `n`. For each test case, it calculates a value based on `n` and prints the result. The calculation involves summing `n` and the integer division of `(n + i)` by `(i * i)` for each `i` from 2 up to the square root of `n` plus one.
