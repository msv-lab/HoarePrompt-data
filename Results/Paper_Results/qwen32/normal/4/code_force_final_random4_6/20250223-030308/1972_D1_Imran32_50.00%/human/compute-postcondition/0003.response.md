To determine the necessary state adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variables `i` and `root`. The loop will execute if `root + 1` is greater than 2, meaning `root` must be at least 2. Given that `root` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, we need to ensure that `n` is such that `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is at least 2. This implies that `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be at least 1, which in turn means `n` must be at least 1.

However, since `n` is already given to be a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^6), `root` will always be at least 2, and the loop will always execute as long as `n` is within the given range. 

Given this, the state of `n` and `root` does not need to be adjusted further to ensure the loop executes. The state of `m` and `ans` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state remains:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^6), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^6), `ans` is `n`, `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`**
