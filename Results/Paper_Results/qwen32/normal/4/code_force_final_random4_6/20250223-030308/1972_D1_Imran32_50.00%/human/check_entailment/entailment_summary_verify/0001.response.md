### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided code. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to ensure the correctness of the assessment:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (which should be `m`).
   - It initializes `ans` to `n`.
   - It calculates the square root of `n` and iterates from 2 to the square root of `n`.
   - For each `i` in this range, it calculates `cnt` as \(i^2\) and adds \((n + i) // cnt\) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary describes the incorrect logic of the code, which involves iterating up to the square root of `n` and performing specific calculations based on `n` and `i`.

4. **Issues Identified**:
   - The code reads `k` instead of `m`, which is a clear mismatch with the problem requirements.
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not match the problem's requirements. It seems to be implementing a different algorithm, possibly for a different problem.
   - The code does not iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the mismatch between the problem requirements and the code's logic, the provided program is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the provided code, and the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
