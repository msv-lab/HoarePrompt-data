### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided program systematically using the annotations and the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires counting ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

This can be rephrased as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

#### Key Observations:
- Simplifying, we get:
\[ a = (k-1) \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
- This implies \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Implementation Analysis:
The provided code does not seem to follow the logic derived from the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.
   - `func_1` reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\)).

2. **Logic Inside `func_1`:**
   - Initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - Calculates the square root of \(n\) and iterates from 2 to the square root of \(n\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates `cnt` as \(i^2\) and adds \((n + i) // cnt\) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

#### Issues with the Provided Code:
1. **Incorrect Variable Naming:**
   - The function `func_1` is incorrectly reading \(k\) instead of \(m\). This is a significant issue, as the problem requires iterating over pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq b \leq m\).

2. **Mismatched Logic:**
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not match the problem's requirements. It seems to be implementing a different algorithm, possibly for a different problem.
   - The code does not iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

3. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations confirm the state of the program right before and after the function call, but they do not reflect the correct logic for solving the problem.

### Conclusion:
Given the significant mismatch between the problem requirements and the code's logic, the provided program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
