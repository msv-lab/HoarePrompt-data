Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n
    root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
    print(ans)
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
2. **Variable Naming**: Inside `func_1()`, the variables are read as `(n, k)`, but the second variable should be `m` according to the problem statement.
3. **Logic**: The logic inside `func_1()` seems unrelated to the problem statement. It calculates something based on `n` and its square root, but it does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is satisfied. Here is a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It seems to be solving a different problem or has a completely unrelated logic.

**Reasoning**: The given program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The logic inside `func_1()` is not related to the problem statement.

**Correctness**: **False**
