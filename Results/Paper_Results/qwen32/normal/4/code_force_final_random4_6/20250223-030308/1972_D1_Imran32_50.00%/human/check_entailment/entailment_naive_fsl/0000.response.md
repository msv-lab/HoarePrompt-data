Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the given code does not follow this logic at all.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. The function `func_1` incorrectly uses `k` instead of `m` as the second input parameter. This suggests a mismatch between the problem description and the code.
2. The logic inside `func_1` is completely unrelated to the problem. It calculates something involving square roots and integer divisions, which does not align with the problem's requirements.
3. The code does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's consider a simple example to demonstrate the issue:
- For the input `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\). The output should be `3`.
- The provided code will not produce this output because it does not correctly implement the required logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
