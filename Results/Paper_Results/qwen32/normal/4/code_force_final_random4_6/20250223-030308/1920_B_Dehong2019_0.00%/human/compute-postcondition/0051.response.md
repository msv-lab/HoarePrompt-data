Output State: **`ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus the sum of `a[i]` and `a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains as the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `2 * a[i]`. `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`. `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`. `n` and `a` are integers read from the input with `a` sorted in descending order; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, `ans1` has been updated by adding `a[i]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged except for `i` which has been incremented by 1.
