The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of the `i`th element in the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is sorted in descending order.
- `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a`.
- `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`.
- `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`.
- `t` is `t - 1`.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input.
- `x` must be greater than 0.

After executing the code snippet, `ans1` is updated to be `ans1 - a[i] * 2`. The values of `ans2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `a[i] * 2`, `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input, `x` must be greater than 0.**
