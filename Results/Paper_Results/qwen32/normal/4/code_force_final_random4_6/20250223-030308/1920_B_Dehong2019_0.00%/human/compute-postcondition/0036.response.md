The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The other variables `ans1`, `ans2`, `ans`, `n`, `k`, and `a` do not directly affect the execution of the loop itself, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a`; `ans2` retains its initial value; `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `a` are the integers read from the input; `a` is sorted in descending order; `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0**
