Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k` are integers where `k` is greater than 0 and `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is updated to the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2`. Otherwise, `ans1` is updated to its current value plus `a[i]`. `ans2` retains its initial value. `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`. `i` is incremented by 1.**
