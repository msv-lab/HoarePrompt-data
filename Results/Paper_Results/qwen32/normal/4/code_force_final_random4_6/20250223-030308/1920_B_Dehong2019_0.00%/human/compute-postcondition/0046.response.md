Postcondition: **`ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]`; `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`; `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`; `n` and `a` are integers read from the input with `a` sorted in descending order; `k` must be greater than 0; `i + x` is less than `n`**
