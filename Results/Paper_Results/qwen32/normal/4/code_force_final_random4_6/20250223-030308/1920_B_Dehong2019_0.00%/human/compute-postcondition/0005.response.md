The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns this sum to the variable `ans1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged except for the introduction of `ans1`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order obtained from the input; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.**
