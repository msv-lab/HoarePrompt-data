The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. Since the loop is defined as `for i in range(x)`, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `x`.

Given that `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1. The value of `x` must remain the same because it determines the total number of iterations the loop will execute.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the first element of `a`; `ans2` retains its initial value; `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `a` are the integers read from the input with `a` sorted in descending order; `i` is 1; `x` must be greater than 0**
