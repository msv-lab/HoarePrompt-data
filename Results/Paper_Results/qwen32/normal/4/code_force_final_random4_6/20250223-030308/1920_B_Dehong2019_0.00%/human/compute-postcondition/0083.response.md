Postcondition: **`a` is sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise it remains unchanged, plus `a[1]`, minus `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`. `ans2` is equal to `ans1` minus `a[0]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise it remains unchanged. `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`. `t` is `t - 1`. `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1.**
