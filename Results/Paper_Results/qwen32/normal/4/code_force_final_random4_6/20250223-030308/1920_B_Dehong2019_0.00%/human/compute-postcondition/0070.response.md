The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `x` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`a` is sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `a[i] * 4`, `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
