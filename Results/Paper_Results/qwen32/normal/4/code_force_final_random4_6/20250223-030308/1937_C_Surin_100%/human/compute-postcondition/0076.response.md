The code snippet sets `v1` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `prev`, `kp`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is the integer input by the user; `g` is 0; `v1` is 0; `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`; `kp` is incremented by 1.**
