Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `g` is initialized to 0
- `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input `r` was `<`. If no `r` was `<`, `v1` is 0
- `prev` is initialized to 0
- `r` is the user's input, and it is explicitly stated that `r` is not equal to `'>'` and `r` is equal to `'='`

### Key Points:
- The variable `r` is given as `'='`.
- Since `r` is `'='`, it means that `v1` (which is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'`) will be 0 because there were no instances where `r` was `'<'`.
- The variable `prev` is initialized to 0 and does not change based on the given information.
- The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state but is used in the print statement. Since `i` is not defined, it's likely a placeholder or a variable that would be defined in the context of a loop or some condition, but it's not provided here. Given the context, we can assume `i` will take on a value such that the print statement can execute. Since `v1` and `prev` are both 0, and `i` is not further defined, we can assume `i` is also 0 for the sake of this example.

### Print Statement Analysis:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```
- The print statement is formatted to output `? i i prev prev`.
- Given that `i` is likely 0 (as `v1` and `prev` are 0 and no other value is specified for `i`), and `prev` is 0, the output will be `? 0 0 0 0`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 0 0 0**
