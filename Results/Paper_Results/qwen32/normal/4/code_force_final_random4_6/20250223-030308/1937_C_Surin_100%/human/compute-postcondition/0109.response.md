Let's analyze the given task step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is some value (its exact value is not provided, so we cannot determine it).
- `prev` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 1 (its exact value is not provided, but it's known to be greater than 1).
- `r` is the value provided by the user.
- `r` is not equal to '>'.
- `r` is equal to '='.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement uses an f-string to format a string that includes the values of `i`, `i`, `prev`, and `prev`.
- `prev` is explicitly given as 0.
- The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value, but we can represent it as `i` in the output.

### Output:
The output will be a string formatted as `'? i i prev prev'` where `prev` is 0 and `i` remains as `i` because its value is not specified.

Output: **? i i 0 0 (where i is the value of i)**
