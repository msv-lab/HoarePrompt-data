The code snippet assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Therefore, after the execution, `v1` will have the same value as `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their conditions and values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `v2` is `i`, `r` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 2`, `v1` is `v2`**.
