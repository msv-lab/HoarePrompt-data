The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `prev`. Since `prev` was initially 0, it will now hold the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` must be greater than 1, `prev` is `i`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string, `r` is not `'>'`, and `r` is equal to `'='`, `r2` is the new input string and `r2` is `'<'`**.
