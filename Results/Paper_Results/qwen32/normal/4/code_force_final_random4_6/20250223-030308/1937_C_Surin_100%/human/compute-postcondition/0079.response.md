Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. `n` is an integer greater than 1.
3. `g` is 0.
4. `v1` is 0.
5. `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`.
6. `kp` is incremented by 1.
7. `v2` is `i`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
- `v1` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `v2` is explicitly stated to be `i`. However, the value of `i` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `v2` but know it is equal to `i`.

### Output:
The print statement will output a formatted string with the values of `v1`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v2`. Since `v1` is 0 and `v2` is `i`, the output will be:

Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is the value of the variable i)**
