To determine the output of the given print statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is unchanged, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `n` is an integer value greater than 1, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `prev` is the value determined by the user's inputs throughout the `n-1` iterations of the loop, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `kp` is incremented by 1, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `g` is 0, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is `i`, but the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only refer to `v2` as `i`.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```
We substitute the known values of `v1` and `v2`:

- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is `i`.

The print statement will output:
Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is the value of i)**
