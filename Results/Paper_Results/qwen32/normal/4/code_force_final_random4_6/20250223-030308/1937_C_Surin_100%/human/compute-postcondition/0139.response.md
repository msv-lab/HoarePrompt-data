Postcondition: **`t` is some value, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the value provided by the user, `i` is incremented by 1. If `r` is equal to '=', `r2` is the value provided by the user through input, and if `r2` is equal to '<', `prev` is set to the incremented value of `i`. Otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged.**
