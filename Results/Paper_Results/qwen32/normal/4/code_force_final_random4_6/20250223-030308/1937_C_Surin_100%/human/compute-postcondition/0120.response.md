The code snippet `r = input()` changes the value of `r` to whatever the user inputs. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Since `i` is described as being incremented by 1 before this code snippet, we can assume that the value of `i` has already been increased by 1 and will not be affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is some value, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the value provided by the user, `i` is incremented by 1**.
