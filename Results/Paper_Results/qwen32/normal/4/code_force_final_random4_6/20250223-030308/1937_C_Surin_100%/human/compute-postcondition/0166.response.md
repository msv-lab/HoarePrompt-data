The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is a function call that flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the values of `i`, `v2`, `r`, `v1`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i+2`, `v2` is `i+2`, `r` is an input string, `v1` is `i+1` if `r` equals `<`, otherwise `v1` is undefined, `n` is unchanged**.
