The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all output is written to the console. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is some value, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the value provided by the user, `i` is incremented by 1**.
