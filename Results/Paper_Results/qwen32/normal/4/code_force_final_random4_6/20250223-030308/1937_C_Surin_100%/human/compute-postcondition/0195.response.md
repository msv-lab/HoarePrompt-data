The code snippet `r2 = input('')` will assign the value of the user input to the variable `r2`. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than `i+1`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, `prev` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `r2` is the new input string.**
