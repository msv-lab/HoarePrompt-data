The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value such that \(1 \leq i < n\). For the next iteration to occur, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is `i`.
- If `r` is `<`, then `v2` is also `i`. Otherwise, `v2` remains unchanged.

We need to adjust `i` by incrementing it by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, and `v2` do not need to be changed as per the loop head constraints.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i + 1`, if `r` is `<`, then `v2` is also `i + 1`. Otherwise, `v2` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`**.

However, since `v1` and `v2` are not part of the loop head and we are only adjusting the loop head variables `i` and `n`, the final adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, if `r` is `<`, then `v2` is also `i`. Otherwise, `v2` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`**.

To simplify and strictly adhere to the loop head variables:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 1`**.
