The code snippet `r2 = input('')` prompts the user for input and assigns that input to the variable `r2`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `r` retain their previous values, and `i` has already been incremented by 1. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of the user's input to `r2`.

Output State: **`t` is some value, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the value provided by the user, `i` is incremented by 1, `r2` is the value provided by the user as input.**
