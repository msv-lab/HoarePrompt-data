The provided code snippet includes a `sys.stdout.flush()` statement, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This operation does not change the values of any variables or the state of the program in terms of variable values. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `kp`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `r`, `prev`, or `i` are modified by this statement.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the output buffer is flushed.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than `i+1`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string. If `r` equals `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i`. If `r` does not equal `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i` if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0. If `r` equals `'='`, `r2` is the new input string, `i` is `i+1`. The output buffer is flushed.**
