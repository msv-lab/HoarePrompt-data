The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we need to adjust only this variable for the loop to execute one more time. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`
- `kp` is incremented by 1
- `v2` is `i + 1`
- `r` is the new input string
- `i` is `i + 1`
- If `r` is `'<'`, then `v1` is `i + 1`. Otherwise, `v1` remains as it was before the if statement.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `v2` is `i + 1`, `r` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 2`**
