Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is the value of `input()`. If `r` is '>', `prev` is the value of `i` before it was incremented. If `r` is '=', `r2` is the value of the next `input()`. If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to the value of `i`. Otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged.**
