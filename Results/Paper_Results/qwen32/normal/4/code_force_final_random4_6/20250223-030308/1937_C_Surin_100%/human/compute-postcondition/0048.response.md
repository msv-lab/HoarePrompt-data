The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call ensures that any buffered output is written to the output stream immediately. It does not change the values of any variables or the state of the program other than flushing the output buffer.

Given the initial state, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `r`, `i`, or `prev` are affected by this function call. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input `r` was `<`. If no `r` was `<`, `v1` is 0. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i`. If `r` is `'='`, `prev` is set to `i` if `r2` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged. If `r` is neither `'>'` nor `'='`, `prev` remains unchanged. `r` is the user's input, `i` is incremented by 1**.
