To determine what will be printed in the given code snippet, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved in the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- `v1`: The value of `v1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe it as `v1`.
- `i`: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but since the initial value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe it as `i` after being incremented.
- `prev`: The value of `prev` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe it as `prev`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement uses an f-string to format the output. It will print a string starting with a question mark followed by the values of `v1`, `i` (after incrementing), `v1` again, and `prev`.
- Since the exact values of `v1` and `prev` are not provided, we can only describe them as `v1` and `prev` respectively.
- The value of `i` is described as `i` after being incremented by 1, but without knowing the initial value of `i`, we can only represent it as `i + 1`.

### Output:
Given the information, the output will be in the form:
Output: **? v1 i+1 v1 prev (where v1 is the value of v1, i is the value of i after being incremented, and prev is the value of prev)**

However, since we typically aim for the most precise output possible based on the given information, and since the exact values of `v1` and `prev` are not provided, we can represent the output as:
Output: **? v1 i+1 v1 prev**
