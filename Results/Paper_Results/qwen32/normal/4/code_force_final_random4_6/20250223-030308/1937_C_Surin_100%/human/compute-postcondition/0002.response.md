The only variable in the loop head of the provided `for` loop is `kp`, which iterates over the range of `int(input())`. To ensure that the loop executes, we need to adjust the state so that the input to `int(input())` results in a value greater than or equal to 1. 

Given the initial state provided:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\)
- There exists a secret permutation `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` of the set \(\{0, 1, ..., n-1\}\)
- `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split string into an integer, returning the result as a list.
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.

The loop `for kp in range(int(input())):` will execute if `int(input())` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `t` is already given to be in the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), we can assume that `t` is the number of test cases, and we need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that the first input read by `int(input())` is `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), the first input read by `int(input())` is `t`**
