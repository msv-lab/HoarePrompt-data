The only variable in the loop head is `kp`, which is the loop variable for the `for` loop. The loop will execute as long as `kp` is less than the integer value of the input. Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `kp` by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input `r` was `<`. If no `r` was `<`, `v1` is 0
- `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`

The state of `kp` at the end of the previous iteration is not explicitly given, but we know that for the loop to proceed to the next iteration, `kp` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input `r` was `<`. If no `r` was `<`, `v1` is 0, `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`, `kp` is incremented by 1**
