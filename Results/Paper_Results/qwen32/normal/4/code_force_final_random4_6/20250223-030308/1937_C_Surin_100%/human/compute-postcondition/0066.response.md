The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `r`, and `r2` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is the value of `input()`, `r2` is the value of the next `input()`, `prev` is equal to `i`**.
