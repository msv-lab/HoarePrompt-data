The value of `prev` is assigned the value of `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, `r`, `i`, and `r2` remain unchanged as per the given code snippet. Since `i` is mentioned to be incremented by 1 in the initial state, we'll consider `prev` to hold that incremented value.

Output State: **`t` is some value, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the value provided by the user, `i` is incremented by 1, `r2` is the value provided by the user through input, `prev` is equal to the incremented value of `i`.**
