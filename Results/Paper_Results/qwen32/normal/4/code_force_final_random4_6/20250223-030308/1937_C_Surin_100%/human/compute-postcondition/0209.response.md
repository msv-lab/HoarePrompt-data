Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than `i+2`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1, the output buffer is flushed, and `prev` is set to the new value of `i` if `r2` is `'<'`. Otherwise, `prev` retains its original value. `r2` is the result of the input function.**
