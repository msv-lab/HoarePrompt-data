The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so we need to increment `i` by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Let's break down the state adjustments:
- `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper bound of the loop.
- `g` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `v1` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `prev` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `r` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `r2` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where `1 <= k < n`), at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input `r` was `<`. If no `r` was `<`, `v1` is 0. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i`. If `r` is `'='` and `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged. `r` is the user's input, `i` is incremented by 1; `r2` is the new user's input if `r` was `'='`, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we do not know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can represent it as `i` being incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input `r` was `<`. If no `r` was `<`, `v1` is 0. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i`. If `r` is `'='` and `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged. `r` is the user's input, `r2` is the new user's input if `r` was `'='`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise in the context of the loop:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1**.
