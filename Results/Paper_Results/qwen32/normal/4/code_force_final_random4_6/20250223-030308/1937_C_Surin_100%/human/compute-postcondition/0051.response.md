Let's break down the given code snippet and initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. `n` is an integer greater than 1.
3. `g` is 0.
4. `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input `r` was `<`. If no `r` was `<`, `v1` is 0.
5. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i`.
6. If `r` is `'='`, `prev` is set to `i` if `r2` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged.
7. If `r` is neither `'>'` nor `'='`, `prev` remains unchanged.
8. `r` is the user's input, `i` is incremented by 1; `r` is the input received from the user.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is formatted to output a string that includes the values of `i`, `i`, `prev`, and `prev` in the format `? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}`.
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the exact value of `i` depends on how many times the loop has run before reaching this print statement.
- The value of `prev` is determined based on the user's input `r` and possibly `r2` (if `r` is `'='`).
- The exact values of `i` and `prev` are not provided in the initial state, so we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output the current value of `i` twice and the current value of `prev` twice, formatted as `? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [i] [i] [prev] [prev] (where [i] is the current value of i and [prev] is the current value of prev)**
