The value of `x` is assigned the result of the expression `abs(a - c) // 2`. The variables `t`, `_`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `_` is incremented by 1; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`.**
