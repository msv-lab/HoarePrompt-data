The function `func` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case is described by six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`. Here, `h` and `w` are the dimensions of a rectangle, and `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are the coordinates of two distinct points within this rectangle. The function processes these test cases and returns a result for each one.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and `t` sets of six integers each (`h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`). It processes each set to determine a result based on the given dimensions and coordinates of points within a rectangle.**
