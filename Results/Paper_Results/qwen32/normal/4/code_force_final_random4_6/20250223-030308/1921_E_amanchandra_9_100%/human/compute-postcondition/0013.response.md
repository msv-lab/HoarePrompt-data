The code snippet `r = min(w, b + x)` updates the value of `r` to be the minimum of `w` and `b + x`. The values of `w`, `b`, and `x` are used to determine the new value of `r`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `r` is `min(w, b + x)`; `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` are six integers read from the input; `a` is less than or equal to `c`; `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`; the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even; `l` is `max(1, b - x)`**.
