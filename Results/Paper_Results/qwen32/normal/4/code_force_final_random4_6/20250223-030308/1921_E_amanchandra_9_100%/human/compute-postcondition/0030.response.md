The code snippet provided is reading six integers from the input and assigning them to the variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is incremented by 1, and `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input. However, the provided code snippet only updates the values of `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` and does not affect `t` or `_`.

Since the code only reads the input values and assigns them to the variables, the values of `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are now set to the input values. The other variables (`t` and `_`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `_` is incremented by 1; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input.**
