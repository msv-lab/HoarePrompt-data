To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the problem step by step using the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **Input Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x`: Six integers read from the input.

2. **Derived Variables:**
   - `x`: Calculated as `abs(a - c) // 2`.
   - `r`: Calculated as `min(w, b + x)`.
   - `l`: Calculated as `max(1, b - x)`.

3. **Conditions:**
   - `a` is less than or equal to `c`.
   - The absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even.

### Code Analysis

The print statement is:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
```

Here's what this does:
- The expression `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` evaluates to either `True` or `False`.
- This boolean value is used to index into the tuple `(['Draw'], ['Bob'])`.
  - If the condition is `True`, it selects `['Bob']`.
  - If the condition is `False`, it selects `['Draw']`.
- The `*` operator unpacks the selected list, so it prints either `Bob` or `Draw`.

### Determining the Output

To determine whether `Bob` or `Draw` is printed, we need to evaluate the condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`.

- `l` is `max(1, b - x)`.
- `r` is `min(w, b + x)`.
- `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`.

Since the exact values of `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `t` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `l` and `r`. However, we can describe the condition in terms of these variables.

- `abs(l - d) <= x` translates to `abs(max(1, b - x) - d) <= x`.
- `abs(r - d) <= x` translates to `abs(min(w, b + x) - d) <= x`.

### Conclusion

The print statement will output either `Bob` or `Draw` based on whether both conditions `abs(max(1, b - x) - d) <= x` and `abs(min(w, b + x) - d) <= x` are satisfied.

Given the initial state and the code, the output can be described as:

Output: **Bob (if abs(max(1, b - x) - d) <= x and abs(min(w, b + x) - d) <= x) otherwise Draw**
