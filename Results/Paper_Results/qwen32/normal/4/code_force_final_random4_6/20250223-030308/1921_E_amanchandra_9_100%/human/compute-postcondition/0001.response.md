The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1, as the loop will iterate `t` times.

Given that `t` is already described as an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it already satisfies the requirement for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop head and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
