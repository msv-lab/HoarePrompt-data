To determine what will be printed by the given code, let's break down the problem step by step based on the initial state and the provided code.

### Initial State and Variables:
1. `t` is an integer input where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `_` is incremented by 1 (this variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task).
3. `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input.
4. `x` is calculated as `abs(a - c) // 2`.
5. `l` is calculated as `max(1, b - abs(a - c) // 2)`.
6. `r` is calculated as `min(w, b + x)`.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
```

This line uses a tuple indexing trick to select between two possible outputs based on the condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`.

- If the condition is `True`, it selects the second element of the tuple, which is `['Bob']`.
- If the condition is `False`, it selects the first element of the tuple, which is `['Draw']`.

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Calculate `x`:** `x = abs(a - c) // 2`
   - This computes the absolute difference between `a` and `c`, then divides by 2 using integer division.

2. **Calculate `l`:** `l = max(1, b - abs(a - c) // 2)`
   - This computes `b - x` and ensures the result is at least 1.

3. **Calculate `r`:** `r = min(w, b + x)`
   - This computes `b + x` and takes the minimum value between `w` and this result.

4. **Evaluate the Condition:**
   - `abs(l - d) <= x`
     - This checks if the absolute difference between `l` and `d` is less than or equal to `x`.
   - `abs(r - d) <= x`
     - This checks if the absolute difference between `r` and `d` is less than or equal to `x`.

5. **Determine the Output:**
   - If both conditions are `True`, the output will be `['Bob']`.
   - If either condition is `False`, the output will be `['Draw']`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output either `['Draw']` or `['Bob']` based on the conditions evaluated.

Output: **['Draw'] or ['Bob'] (depending on whether abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x)**
