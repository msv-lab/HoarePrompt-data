Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is incremented by 1. (Note: The underscore `_` is commonly used in Python to indicate a variable that we do not intend to use. However, in this context, it seems to be used as a counter, and it is incremented by 1.)
- `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Draw')
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. This statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `_`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`. The values of these variables are not used in the code snippet provided.

### Conclusion:
The `print('Draw')` statement will output the string `'Draw'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Draw**
