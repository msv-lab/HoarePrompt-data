The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common throwaway variable used in loops where the loop variable is not needed. In this case, the loop will iterate `t` times, and `_` simply acts as a counter that is incremented automatically by the `range` function.

Since `_` is not modified within the loop body (as it is a throwaway variable), the state at the start of the next iteration only requires incrementing `_` by 1. The other variables `t`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, `r`, and `l` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we just need to increment `_` by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input. If `a` is greater than `c`, no changes are made to `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`. If `a` is less than or equal to `c`, `x` is set to `abs(a - c) // 2`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, then `r` is set to `min(w, d + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, d - x)`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, then `r` is set to `min(w, b + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, b - x)`**

At the start of the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `_` is incremented by 1; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input. If `a` is greater than `c`, no changes are made to `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`. If `a` is less than or equal to `c`, `x` is set to `abs(a - c) // 2`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, then `r` is set to `min(w, d + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, d - x)`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, then `r` is set to `min(w, b + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, b - x)`**
