Output State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `_` is incremented by 1; `r` is `min(w, d + x)`; `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`; `l` is `max(1, d - x)`**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. All other variables retain their previously assigned values.
