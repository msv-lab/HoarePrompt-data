Output State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `_` is incremented by 1; `r` is `min(w, b + abs(a - c) // 2)`; `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`; `l` is `max(1, b - abs(a - c) // 2)`**

In simple terms, the variable `r` is updated to be the minimum of `w` and the sum of `b` and `abs(a - c) // 2`. All other variables retain their initial values or expressions.
