You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

                r = min(w, d + x)

- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of a rectangle defined by dimensions `h` and `w`, and two points within the rectangle defined by coordinates `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)`. For each test case, it determines and prints the result ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') based on the relative positions of the points within the rectangle.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner or a draw is flawed. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample.

The program uses the following logic:
1. If Alice's initial row (`a`) is greater than Bob's initial row (`c`), it immediately returns "Draw".
2. If Alice's initial row is not greater than Bob's, it calculates the number of moves (`x`) Alice can make vertically towards Bob.
3. Depending on whether the number of moves (`x`) is odd or even, it calculates a range of columns (`l` to `r`) where Bob's chip can be caught.
4. Based on this range, it determines the winner.

However, this logic does not correctly account for all scenarios, particularly when Alice and Bob can move diagonally and the number of moves is not straightforward.

Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5 5 1 1 5 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Explanation:**
- Alice starts at (1, 1) and Bob starts at (5, 5).
- Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left.
- Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left.
- Given the board dimensions and initial positions, Alice and Bob are at opposite corners and cannot meet in any number of moves without exceeding the board boundaries. Therefore, the game should end in a draw.

However, the provided program will incorrectly output "Draw" based on a flawed calculation. To verify this, let's consider another test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5 5 1 1 4 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Explanation:**
- Alice starts at (1, 1) and Bob starts at (4, 4).
- Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left.
- Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left.
- Alice cannot reach Bob in any number of moves without exceeding the board boundaries. Therefore, the game should end in a draw.

However, the provided program will incorrectly determine the winner or a draw based on the flawed logic.

Given these examples and the analysis, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
