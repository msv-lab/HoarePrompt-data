The value of `r` is updated to be the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `t` remains an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `_` is incremented by 1; `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` retain their input values; `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`; and `l` is `max(1, d - abs(a - c) // 2)`.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `_` is incremented by 1; `r` is `min(w, d + abs(a - c) // 2)`; `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`; `l` is `max(1, d - abs(a - c) // 2)`**.
