The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, and `d`, and specifies that the current value of `a` is greater than the current value of `c`. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet does not directly depend on the values of any of these variables. The statement simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Relationships**: 
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, and `d` are integers.
   - It is given that `a > c`.

2. **Examine the Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('Draw')`.
   - This statement does not reference any of the variables `t`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, or `d`.

3. **Determine the Output**:
   - Since the print statement is a simple print of the string `'Draw'`, the output will be exactly that string.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **Draw**
