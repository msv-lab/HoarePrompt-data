Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. The function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the closest city for each city. It should determine whether to move to the next or previous city based on the unique closest city condition, but it doesn't correctly implement this logic. Specifically, the function is supposed to return a list where each element represents the cost to move to the closest city, but it incorrectly assigns `1` when the next city is closer and the actual distance when the previous city is closer.

2. The program calculates prefix sums incorrectly. The prefix sums should represent the cumulative cost to move from the first city to each subsequent city using the closest city moves. However, the prefix sums are calculated using the incorrect values returned by `func_1`.

3. The program does not handle the case where the closest city is the next city correctly. When the closest city is the next city, the cost should be `1` (as per the problem statement), but the function `func_1` does not correctly handle this case.

4. The program assumes that the closest city is always either the next or previous city, which is not necessarily true based on the problem description. The problem guarantees that for every city, the closest city is unique, but it does not specify that it must be the next or previous city.

To fix these issues, the function `func_1` needs to be rewritten to correctly determine the closest city for each city and return the cost to move to that closest city. The prefix sums should then be calculated using the correct costs.
