The value of `forward` is updated to `cities[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, `forward` becomes `cities[4]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `back` is determined by the condition `if i > 0`, which is true since `i` is 3. Therefore, `back` is set to `cities[2]`. The other variables remain as per their initial conditions.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` remains the same, `back` is `cities[2]`, `forward` is `cities[4]`**.
