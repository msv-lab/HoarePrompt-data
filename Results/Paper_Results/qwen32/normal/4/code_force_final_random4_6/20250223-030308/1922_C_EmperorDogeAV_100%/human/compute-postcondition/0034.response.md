Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `n` remains the same, `back` is set to `cities[2]`. If `i < n - 1`, `forward` is set to `cities[4]`. Otherwise, `forward` remains 999999999999999999`. `prog_cities[3]` is set to 1 if `abs(forward - cities[3]) < abs(cities[3] - back)`. Otherwise, `prog_cities[3]` is set to `abs(cities[4] - cities[3])` if `n > 4`, otherwise `prog_cities[3]` is `abs(999999999999999999 - cities[3])`.**
