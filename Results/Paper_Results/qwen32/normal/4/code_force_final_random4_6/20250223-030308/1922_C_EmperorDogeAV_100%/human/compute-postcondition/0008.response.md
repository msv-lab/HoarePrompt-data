Output State: **`cities` is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains integers. The first integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) represents the number of cities, followed by `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities. The next integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) represents the number of queries, followed by `m` pairs of integers x_i, y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the queries. `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros. `n` is at least 2. `i` is less than `n - 1`. If `i` is greater than 0, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`; otherwise, `back` remains -99999999999999999999. `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `forward` has been updated to `cities[i + 1]`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
