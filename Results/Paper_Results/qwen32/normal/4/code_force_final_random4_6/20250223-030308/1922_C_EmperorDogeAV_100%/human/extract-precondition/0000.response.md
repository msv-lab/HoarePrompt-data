Precondition: **cities is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains integers. The first integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) represents the number of cities, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities. The next integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) represents the number of queries, followed by m pairs of integers x_i, y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
