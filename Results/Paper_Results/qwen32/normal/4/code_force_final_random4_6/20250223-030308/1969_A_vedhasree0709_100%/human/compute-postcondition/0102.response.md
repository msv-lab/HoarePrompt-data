Output State: **t is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 4999; n is the input integer; l is a list of integers obtained from the input; i is equal to n if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, or the value when q == i + 1 if the loop breaks early; j is 0 indicating that the loop did not break due to q == i + 1, or j is 1 indicating that the loop broke due to q == i + 1.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop are complete, the variable `t` will have been decremented by the number of times the loop ran, with `t` ranging from 0 to 4999. The variable `n` remains the same as the input integer, and `l` remains the list of integers obtained from the input. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` if the loop completed all iterations without breaking, or it will be the value of `i` when the condition `q == i + 1` was met, causing the loop to break. The variable `j` will be 0 if the loop did not break due to the condition `q == i + 1`, or it will be 1 if the loop broke due to that condition.
