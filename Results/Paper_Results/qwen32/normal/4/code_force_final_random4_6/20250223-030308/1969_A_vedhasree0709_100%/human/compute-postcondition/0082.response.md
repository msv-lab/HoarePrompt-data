The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 1.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`. Since `i` is currently 1, `n` must be at least 2 to satisfy the condition `i <= n - 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted as per the requirement to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 4999; `n` must be at least 2; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1; `j` is 1 if `q` is equal to `i + 1`, otherwise `j` remains 0; `p` is the first element of `l`; `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in `l`. If `q` is equal to `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
