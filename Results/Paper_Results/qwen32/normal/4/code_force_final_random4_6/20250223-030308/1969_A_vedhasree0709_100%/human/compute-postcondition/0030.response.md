To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the variables.

The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`. In each iteration:
- `p` is assigned the value of `l[i]`.
- `q` is assigned the value of `l[p - 1]`.
- If `q` equals `i + 1`, the loop prints `2`, sets `j` to `1`, and breaks out of the loop.
- If `q` does not equal `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by `1` and the loop continues.

If the loop completes all iterations without finding a match (`q == i + 1`), `i` will be equal to `n` and `j` will remain `0`.

Given the above, the final state of the variables after all iterations will be:
- `i` will be `n` (since it will have been incremented from `0` to `n - 1` and then checked against `n - 1`, making the loop condition `i <= n - 1` false).
- `j` will be `0` unless a match was found during any iteration (in which case `j` would be `1` and the loop would have broken early).

Since the problem does not specify that a match was found during the iterations, we assume the loop completes all iterations without finding a match.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is `n`; `j` is `0`.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, and `j` will be `0` unless a match was found during any iteration. Since no match was found in the provided output states, `j` remains `0`.
