Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `p` is `l[0]`; `q` is `l[l[0] - 1]`; and `q` equals `i + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but no variables are modified.
