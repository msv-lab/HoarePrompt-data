The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new value to the variable `n` based on the integer input provided. The initial value of `n` is not specified, but after this line, `n` will hold the value of the integer input. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 4999; `n` is the newly input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is the initial value of `n`; `j` is 0, indicating that the loop did not break out early.**
