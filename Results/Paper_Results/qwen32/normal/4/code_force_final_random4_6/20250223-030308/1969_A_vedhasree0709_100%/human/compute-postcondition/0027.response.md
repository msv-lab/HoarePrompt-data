Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 3; `l` is a list of integers; `i` is 2; `p` is `l[2]`; `q` is `l[l[2] - 1]`; `j` is 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `p`, `q`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that it exits the most internal loop or if statement.
