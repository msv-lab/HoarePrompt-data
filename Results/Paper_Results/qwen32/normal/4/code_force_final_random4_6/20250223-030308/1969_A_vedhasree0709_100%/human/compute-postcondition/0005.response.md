To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the loop condition `i <= n - 1`. This condition will be true if `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 0

The variables `t`, `l`, and `j` are not part of the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted. The only variables we can adjust are `i` and `n`.

For the loop to execute at least once:
- `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.

Since `i` is initially 0, the condition `0 <= n - 1` must be true. This implies that `n` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is at least 1. The state of `i` does not need to be changed since it is already 0, which satisfies the condition when `n` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 0**
