Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list `p` of `n` integers. Each integer `p_i` in the list `p` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i, and all `p_i` are distinct. The function returns a result for each test case based on these inputs.**
