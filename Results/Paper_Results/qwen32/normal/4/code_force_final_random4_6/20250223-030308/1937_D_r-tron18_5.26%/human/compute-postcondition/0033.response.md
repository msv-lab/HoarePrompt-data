Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0, n]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is set to `n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `ans[i]` is set to `n - 2 * totalOne`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is `s1[n - 1]` (which is either '<' or '>'), and `el` is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `1`. `zeroInd` is `n`, and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `oneInd` is `2 * totalOne`.**
