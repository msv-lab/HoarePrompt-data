You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` processes a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. It calculates and prints a list of `n` integers based on the positions and counts of '<' and '>' characters in the string. The final state of the program includes the original string `s1` remaining unchanged, while the output is a list of integers derived from the specified conditions and calculations within the function.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze whether it meets the problem requirements for all potential cases. The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a grid with characters '<' and '>', where the characters invert after the pinball moves off them, and the goal is to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.

Let's review the provided program:

```python
from itertools import accumulate

# Function 1:
def func_1(arr, times):
    l = len(arr)
    return arr[-1] - arr[max(-l, -1 - times)]

# Function 2:
def func_2(s1, n):
    pre = [i + 1 for (i, el) in enumerate(s1) if el == '>']
    totalOne = len(pre)
    preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))
    suffZero = [0]
    ans = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        el = s1[i]
        if el == '>':
            (ol, zr) = (totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1)
            if ol <= zr:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
                oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
                oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
                fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
            preOne.pop()
            totalOne -= 1
        else:
            suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
            (ol, zr) = (totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1)
            if zr <= ol:
                zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
                oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
    print(*ans)
```

### Analysis

The provided solution is quite complex and involves a lot of precomputation and index manipulations. To determine its correctness, we need to verify that it correctly simulates the pinball movement and handles all edge cases.

#### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Single Cell Grid (`n = 1`)**: The pinball should leave in 1 second.
2. **Grid with All '<' or All '>'**: The pinball should leave in `n` seconds.
3. **Alternating '<' and '>'**: The pinball should take a calculated number of steps based on the position and alternating pattern.
4. **Random Patterns**: The solution should handle any random pattern of '<' and '>'.

#### Verification:
- The code uses prefix and suffix sums to optimize the calculation of movement steps, which is efficient given the constraints.
- The logic within `func_2` seems to correctly handle the movement and inversion rules.

### Testing with Example Cases:
Let's test the program with a few example cases to see if it produces the expected output.

#### Example 1:
Input:
```
3
3
><<
4
<<<<
6
<><<<>
```
Expected Output:
```
3 6 5 
1 2 3 4 
1 4 7 10 8 1 
```

Running the program with this input should produce the expected output.

#### Implementation Testing:
Let's manually verify a few cases:
- **Case 1**: `n = 3`, `s = "><<"`:
  - Starting at position 1: `>`, moves right to position 2, `<<`, moves left to position 1, `><`, moves right to position 2, `><`, moves right to position 3, `><`, leaves the grid. Total steps = 3.
  - Starting at position 2: `<<`, moves left to position 1, `><`, moves right to position 2, `><`, moves right to position 3, `><`, moves right to position 4, leaves the grid. Total steps = 6.
  - Starting at position 3: `<`, moves left to position 2, `><`, moves right to position 3, `><`, moves right to position 4, leaves the grid. Total steps = 5.
- **Case 2**: `n = 4`, `s = "<<<<"`:
  - Starting at position 1: `<<<`, moves left to position 0, leaves the grid. Total steps = 1.
  - Starting at position 2: `<<`, moves left to position 1, `><`, moves right to position 2, `><`, moves right to position 3, `><`, moves right to position 4, leaves the grid. Total steps = 2.
  - Starting at position 3: `<`, moves left to position 2, `><`, moves right to position 3, `><`, moves right to position 4, leaves the grid. Total steps = 3.
  - Starting at position 4: `>`, moves right to position 5, leaves the grid. Total steps = 4.

The program correctly handles these cases.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis and testing, the program seems to correctly simulate the pinball movement and handle all edge cases. The provided solution is efficient and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly handles the movement of the pinball for all potential cases and produces the expected output.
