To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` and update the value of `ans[i]` accordingly. Let's break down the initial state and the calculation:

- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus one if `el` is '>', and unchanged if `el` is '<'.
- `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'.
- `suffZero` is `[0, n - 1]` if `el` is '>', and `[0, n, 2n - 1]` if `el` is '<'.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `el` is `s1[n - 2]` (which is either '<' or '>').
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `zeroInd` is `n - 1` if `el` is '>', and `3n - 1` if `el` is '<'.
- `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol` is greater than `zr` and `el` is '>'.

Now, we need to calculate `ans[i]` using the given expression:

`ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`

Let's substitute the values:

- If `el` is '>', then `zeroInd = n - 1`.
- If `el` is '<', then `zeroInd = 3n - 1`.

Since `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, the exact value of `oneInd` depends on the function `func_1` and the values in `preOne` and `zr`. However, we can express the output state in terms of these variables.

Finally, the updated `ans[i]` will be:

- If `el` is '>', `ans[i] = (n - 1) - oneInd + n + 1 = 2n - oneInd`.
- If `el` is '<', `ans[i] = (3n - 1) - oneInd + n + 1 = 4n - oneInd`.

The other variables remain the same as they were not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus one if `el` is '>', and unchanged if `el` is '<'; `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, n - 1]` if `el` is '>', and `[0, n, 2n - 1]` if `el` is '<'; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided, and `ans[n-2]` is `2n - oneInd` if `el` is '>', and `4n - oneInd` if `el` is '<'; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2`; `el` is `s1[n - 2]` (which is either '<' or '>'); `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `n - 1` if `el` is '>', and `3n - 1` if `el` is '<'; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol` is greater than `zr` and `el` is '>'**.
