The code snippet `zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]` calculates the value of `zeroInd` by multiplying the last element of the list `suffZero` by 2. Given the initial state, `suffZero` is `[0]`, so `suffZero[-1]` is `0`. Therefore, `zeroInd` becomes `2 * 0`, which is `0`.

None of the other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is `s1[n - 1]` which is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `0`, `zeroInd` is `0`. Additionally, `ol` is greater than `zr`.**
