The code snippet `oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)` modifies the value of `oneInd` by subtracting the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)` from it.

Given the initial state, the value of `oneInd` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`. After the code snippet is executed, `oneInd` will be updated to `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus one if `el` is '>', and unchanged if `el` is '<'; `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', and `[0, n]` if `el` is '<'; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2`; `el` is `s1[n - 2]` (which is either '<' or '>'); `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `1` if `el` is '<'; `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `2 * n` if `el` is '<'; `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol` is greater than `zr` and `el` is '>'**.
