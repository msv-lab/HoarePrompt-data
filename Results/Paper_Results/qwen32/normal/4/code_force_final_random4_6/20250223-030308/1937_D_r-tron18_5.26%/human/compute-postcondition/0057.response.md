Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus one if `el` is '>', and unchanged if `el` is '<'; `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, n - 1]` if `el` is '>', and `[0, n, 2n - 1]` if `el` is '<'; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided. If `zr <= ol`, then `ans[n-2]` is `2n - oneInd` if `el` is '>', and `4n - oneInd` if `el` is '<', with `oneInd` being `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` if `el` is '>', and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`. `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2`; `el` is `s1[n - 2]` (which is either '<' or '>'); `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol` is greater than `zr` and `el` is '>'**
