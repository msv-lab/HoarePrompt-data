To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `s1` remains unchanged.
- `pre` remains unchanged.
- `totalOne` is initialized to `0`.
- `preOne` is initialized to `[0]`.
- `suffZero` contains cumulative sums of indices for '<' characters.
- `ans` is a list of `n` integers calculated based on loop conditions.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*ans)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(*ans)` statement will print all the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.
- The exact values of `ans` depend on the loop conditions and how `ans` is calculated within the code (which is not provided here). However, based on the given initial state, we know that `ans` is a list of `n` integers.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `ans` are not provided and depend on the calculation within the loop, we can only describe the output in terms of what it will be, given that `ans` is a list of `n` integers.

### Final Output:
Output: **n integers (where n is the length of the list `ans` and the integers are the values calculated based on the loop conditions)**
