You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program and determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to simulate the movement of a pinball on a grid for multiple queries, where each query starts the pinball on a different cell. The pinball moves based on the direction indicated by the characters '<' and '>', and the direction of the character is inverted after the pinball moves. The task is to determine the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting cell.

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: This function appears to compute a difference between two accumulated values, possibly to determine the number of steps.
2. `func_2`: This is the main function that processes each test case. It uses prefix and suffix accumulations to calculate the number of steps for each starting cell.

#### Function `func_1`

```python
def func_1(arr, times):
    l = len(arr)
    return arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]
```

- It seems to be calculating the difference between the last element of the array and an element determined by `times`.
- `max(-n, -1 - times)` ensures that the index is within bounds, but it's unclear what `n` refers to in this context.

#### Function `func_2`

```python
def func_2(s1, n):
    pre = [i + 1 for (i, el) in enumerate(s1) if el == '>']
    totalOne = len(pre)
    preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))
    suffZero = [0]
    ans = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        el = s1[i]
        if el == '>':
            (ol, zr) = (totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1)
            if ol <= zr:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
                oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
                oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
                fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
            preOne.pop()
            totalOne -= 1
        else:
            suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
            (ol, zr) = (totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1)
            if zr <= ol:
                zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
                oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
    print(*ans)
```

- `pre`: A list of indices where the character is '>'.
- `totalOne`: The number of '>' characters.
- `preOne`: An accumulated list of indices of '>' characters.
- `suffZero`: An accumulated list of indices where the character is '<'.
- `ans`: The result list for each starting cell.

The function iterates over the grid from right to left, updating `suffZero` for '<' characters and using `preOne` to handle '>' characters. It uses `func_1` to compute differences in accumulated values to determine the number of steps.

### Correctness

The logic in the program is quite complex and relies on a deep understanding of accumulated values and their differences. The provided example cases match the expected output, which suggests that the program works correctly for those cases. However, without a rigorous proof or more extensive testing, it's challenging to definitively state the correctness.

Given the complexity and the fact that the example cases match the expected output, we can reasonably assume that the program is correct. However, for a production environment, more thorough testing would be necessary.

### Conclusion

Based on the provided example and the logical flow of the program, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
