The code snippet assigns a value to `ans[i]` based on the given variables. Here's the updated state:

- `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.
- `zeroInd` is `n`.
- `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- `n` is the length of the string `s1`.

Given these, the output state is:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0, n]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is `s1[n - 1]` (which is either '<' or '>'), `el` is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `1`, `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` is `n`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**

In natural language: The value of `ans[i]` is updated to `n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1`. All other variables retain their previous values.
