Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`; `suffZero` is `[0]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated as follows: if `ol` (which is `totalOne`) is less than or equal to `zr` (which is `0`), then `ans[n-1]` is `- (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`; otherwise, `ans[n-1]` is `-preOne[1] + n + 1`; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1`; `el` is `s1[n - 1]` which is '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0`; `zeroInd` is `0`; `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, otherwise `oneInd` is `preOne[1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol` is greater than `zr`.**
