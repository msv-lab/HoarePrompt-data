The given code snippet updates the value of `zeroInd` based on the value of `suffZero[-1]`. Specifically, `zeroInd` is set to `2 * suffZero[-1]`.

Let's break it down:
- If `el` is '>', `suffZero` is `[0]`. Therefore, `suffZero[-1]` is `0`, and `zeroInd` becomes `2 * 0`, which is `0`.
- If `el` is '<', `suffZero` is `[0, n]`. Therefore, `suffZero[-1]` is `n`, and `zeroInd` becomes `2 * n`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `zeroInd`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus one if `el` is '>', and unchanged if `el` is '<'; `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', and `[0, n]` if `el` is '<'; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2`; `el` is `s1[n - 2]` (which is either '<' or '>'); `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `1` if `el` is '<'; `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `2 * n` if `el` is '<'; `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol` is less than or equal to `zr` and `el` is '>', otherwise `preOne[1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. If `el` is '<', `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `2 * totalOne`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol` is greater than `zr` and `el` is '>'**
