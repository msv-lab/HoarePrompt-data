The code snippet provided updates the value of `ans[i]` based on the expression `zeroInd - oneInd`. 

Given the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `n - 3`
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions
- `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on specific conditions and values provided

The code snippet modifies `ans[i]` to be `zeroInd - oneInd`. Therefore, the value of `ans[i]` will be updated to the result of `zeroInd - oneInd`.

All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus one if `el` is '>', and unchanged if `el` is '<'; `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list defined based on the value of `el` and other conditions; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided and `ans[i]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd`; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 3`; `el` is `s1[n - 3]` (which is either '<' or '>'); `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `1` if `el` is '<'; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`; `fi` is calculated based on conditions involving `preOne`, `zr`, and `ol` if `el` is '>'; `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**
