The function `func_2` processes a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. It calculates and prints a list of `n` integers based on the positions and counts of '<' and '>' characters in the string. The final state of the program includes the original string `s1` remaining unchanged, while the output is a list of integers derived from the specified conditions and calculations within the function.
