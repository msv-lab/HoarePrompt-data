The provided code snippet `a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` assigns the string of all lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z' to the variable `a`. The initial state mentions `t`, `n`, and a list `a` of integers, but the code snippet does not affect `t`, `n`, or the list `a` of integers. Instead, it redefines `a` as a string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the original list `a` of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n is not modified; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**
