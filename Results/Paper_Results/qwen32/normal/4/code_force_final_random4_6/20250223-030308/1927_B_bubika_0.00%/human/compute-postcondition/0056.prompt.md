Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the original list `a` of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n is not modified; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `b` is a list of 26 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `s` is a list of integers; `r` is a string formed by concatenating characters from `a` based on the indices found in `b` for each element in `s`; `b` is a list with values incremented based on the occurrences of each element in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the list of integers obtained from the input; `r` is the concatenated string of `a[x]` for each `i` in `s`; `b` is a list with values incremented based on the occurrences of each element in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the list of integers provided as input; `r` is a string formed by concatenating characters from `a` based on the indices of elements in `s` and their occurrences; `b` is a list where each element reflects the total count of occurrences of its corresponding element in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
