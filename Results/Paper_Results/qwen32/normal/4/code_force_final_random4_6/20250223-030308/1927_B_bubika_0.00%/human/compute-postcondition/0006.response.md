The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the list `s`. The loop will execute if `s` has at least one element. The variables `t`, `n`, and `r` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, but they are part of the state provided.

To ensure the loop executes, the list `s` must contain at least one integer. The variable `i` is automatically assigned the first element of `s` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `s` has at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `r` is an empty string**
