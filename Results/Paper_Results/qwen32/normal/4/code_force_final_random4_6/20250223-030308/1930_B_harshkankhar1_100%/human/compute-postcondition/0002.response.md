Let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state:

### Initial State:
1. **Test Cases**: The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) — the number of test cases.
2. **Permutation Length**: For each test case, the first line contains a single integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the permutation `p`.
3. **Permutation List**: `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to n, with the elements at even indices reversed.

### Understanding the Permutation List `a`:
- The list `a` is initialized with integers from 1 to `n`.
- The elements at even indices are then reversed. Note that in Python, list indexing starts at 0, so "even indices" would be 0, 2, 4, ..., and "odd indices" would be 1, 3, 5, ...

### Example Construction:
Let's construct the list `a` for a specific `n` to understand the transformation:
- Suppose `n = 6`.
- Initial list: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
- Elements at even indices (0, 2, 4) are `[1, 3, 5]`.
- Reversing these elements gives `[5, 3, 1]`.
- Placing these reversed elements back into their respective positions in the list results in `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`.

### General Case:
- For a general `n`, the elements at even indices are `[1, 3, 5, ..., n-2, n]` if `n` is even, or `[1, 3, 5, ..., n-2, n-1]` if `n` is odd.
- These elements are reversed and placed back into the list.

### Print Statement:
The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Output Description:
The output will be the permutation of numbers from 1 to `n` where the elements at even indices are reversed.

### Final Output:
Given the above understanding, the final output for each test case will be the permutation list `a` with elements at even indices reversed.

Output: **a (where a is the permutation list of numbers from 1 to n with elements at even indices reversed)**

Since the exact values of `n` and `t` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the permutation list `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated permutation list for each test case.

Output: **a (where a is the permutation list of numbers from 1 to n with elements at even indices reversed)**
