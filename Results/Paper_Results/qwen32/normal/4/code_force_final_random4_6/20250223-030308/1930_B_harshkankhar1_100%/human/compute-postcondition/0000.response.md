Output State: **Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the permutation p. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to n.**

In simple terms, the output state is that `a` is now a list of integers starting from 1 up to `n`, where `n` is the length of the permutation `p` for each test case. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
