The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` must be at least 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since `i` is the loop variable and it is increased by 1 in each iteration), making `i` equal to 5. Additionally, `n` must be at least 5 to ensure that `i` is still less than `n + 1`.

State: **`n` must be at least 5, `j` is an input integer + 1, `t` is `t - 1`, `sum` is 57, `i` is 5**
