To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
2. `j` is an input integer + 1.
3. `t` is `t - 1`. (Note: `t` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.)
4. `sum` is calculated as \(\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}\). (Note: `sum` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.)

### Code to be executed:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
1. **First Argument (`1`)**:
   - This is a constant value `1`.

2. **Second Argument (`n - j + 1`)**:
   - Since `j` is defined as the input integer + 1, if we denote the input integer by `input_j`, then `j = input_j + 1`.
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` can be rewritten as `n - (input_j + 1) + 1 = n - input_j`.

3. **Third Argument (`*range(1, n + 1)`)**:
   - This uses the unpacking operator `*` to print the elements of the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` will generate numbers from `1` to `n`.

### Putting It All Together:
- The first value printed is `1`.
- The second value printed is `n - input_j`.
- The third part prints the numbers from `1` to `n`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the code, the output will be:
Output: **1, n - input_j, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where input_j is the input integer and n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
