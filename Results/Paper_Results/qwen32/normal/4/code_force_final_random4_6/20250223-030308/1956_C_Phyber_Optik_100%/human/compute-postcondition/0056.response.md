Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State
1. **n**: An integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
2. **j**: An integer defined as the input integer + 1.
3. **t**: An integer defined as t - 1 (Note: The value of t is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
4. **sum**: A calculated value given by the formula \(\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}\) (Note: The value of `sum` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).

### Print Statement
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis
1. **2**: This is a constant integer value.
2. **n - j + 1**: This expression involves the variables `n` and `j`.
   - Since `j` is defined as the input integer + 1, we can denote the input integer as `input_integer`. Thus, `j = input_integer + 1`.
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` can be rewritten as `n - (input_integer + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - input_integer`.
3. **\*range(1, n + 1)**: This will unpack the range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

### Output
Given the above analysis, the print statement will output:
- The constant integer `2`.
- The result of the expression `n - input_integer`.
- The sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output
Output: **2, n - input_integer, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where input_integer is the input integer used to calculate j)**
