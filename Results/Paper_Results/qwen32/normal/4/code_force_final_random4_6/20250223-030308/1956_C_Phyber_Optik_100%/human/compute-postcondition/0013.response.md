To determine the output of the provided `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State
- `sum` is calculated as \(1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)\), where \(n\) must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so it must be assumed that `j` is a variable that has a value, but it is not provided. For the sake of this problem, we will assume `j` is a known value, but since it's not provided, we'll describe the output in terms of `j`.

### Code Snippet
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Breakdown of the Print Statement
1. **First Argument: `1`**
   - This is a constant value, so it will always print `1`.

2. **Second Argument: `n - j + 1`**
   - This expression depends on the values of `n` and `j`.
   - Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is not defined, we will represent this as `n - j + 1`.

3. **Third Argument: `*range(1, n + 1)`**
   - This will unpack the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - For example, if `n` is 5, this will print `1 2 3 4 5`.
   - If `n` is 3, this will print `1 2 3`.

### Final Output
The output of the print statement will be:
- The constant value `1`.
- Followed by the value of `n - j + 1`.
- Followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Given that `j` is not explicitly defined, we will describe the output in terms of `j`.

### Final Answer
Output: **1, n - j + 1, 1 2 3 ... n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and j is a known integer)**
