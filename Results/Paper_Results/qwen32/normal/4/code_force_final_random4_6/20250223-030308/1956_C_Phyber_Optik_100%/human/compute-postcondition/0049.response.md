Let's calculate the impact of the provided code snippet on the initial state.

Initial State:
- `n` must be at least 4
- `j` is an input integer + 1
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `sum` is `1 + (2i^2 - i)`
- `i` is 4

Code to be executed:
```
sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
```

Given `i` is 4, let's calculate the value of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`:
- `i * i` is `4 * 4` which equals `16`
- `(i - 1) * (i - 1)` is `3 * 3` which equals `9`
- `16 - 9` equals `7`
- `7 * 4` equals `28`

Thus, `sum` is updated to `sum + 28`.

The initial value of `sum` is `1 + (2i^2 - i)`. Substituting `i = 4`:
- `2i^2` is `2 * 16` which equals `32`
- `32 - 4` equals `28`
- `1 + 28` equals `29`

So, the initial value of `sum` is `29`. After the operation, `sum` becomes `29 + 28` which equals `57`.

Other variables (`n`, `j`, `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `j` is an input integer + 1, `t` is `t - 1`, `sum` is 57, `i` is 4**
