The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is at least 2. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `n` must remain at least 2 for the loop to execute again, and for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Given that `sum` is calculated as `1 + (2 * i - 1) * i` at the end of the previous iteration, we don't need to adjust `sum` because it is not part of the loop head and its value is recalculated within the loop body.

Let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`. For the loop to continue, `x + 1` must be less than `n + 1`, which means `x` must be less than `n`.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can represent the state in terms of the incremented `i`:

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.

If we assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we need a concrete state, let's assume `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration (the first iteration of the loop). Then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3**.
