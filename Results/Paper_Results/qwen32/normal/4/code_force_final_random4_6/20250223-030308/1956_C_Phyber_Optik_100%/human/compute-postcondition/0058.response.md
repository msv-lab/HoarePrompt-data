Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
2. `j` is an input integer + 2.
3. `t` is `t - 1` (Note: `t` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
4. `sum` is calculated as \(\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}\) (Note: `sum` is also not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Argument**: `1`
   - This is a constant value `1`.

2. **Second Argument**: `n - j + 1`
   - Given that `j` is an input integer + 2, let's denote the input integer as `input_j`. Therefore, `j = input_j + 2`.
   - The expression `n - j + 1` can be rewritten as `n - (input_j + 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - input_j - 1`.

3. **Third Argument**: `*range(1, n + 1)`
   - This will print all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. For example, if `n` is 5, it will print `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

### Output:
The print statement will output `1`, followed by the value of `n - input_j - 1`, and then the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output Format:
Output: **1, n - input_j - 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where input_j is the input integer, and n is the given integer greater than or equal to 1)**

To make it more precise and understandable, let's assume an example value for `n` and `input_j`:

- If `n` is 5 and `input_j` is 2, then `j` would be 4 (since `j = input_j + 2`).
- The second argument `n - j + 1` would be `5 - 4 + 1 = 2`.
- The sequence from `range(1, n + 1)` would be `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

So, the output would be:

Output: **1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5**

However, since we are asked to provide the most precise description possible based on the given information without specific values for `n` and `input_j`, the final answer is:

Output: **1, n - input_j - 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where input_j is the input integer, and n is the given integer greater than or equal to 1)**
