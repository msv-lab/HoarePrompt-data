Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is an input integer.
2. `j` is an input integer + 1 (though `j` is not used in the print statement).
3. `t` is `t - 1` (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
4. `sum` is calculated using the formula \(\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}\).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(sum, n + n)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `n`:** 
   - `n` is an input integer. We don't know the exact value, but we know it's an integer.

2. **Variable `sum`:**
   - `sum` is calculated using the formula \(\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}\).
   - This formula gives the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers.

3. **Expression `n + n`:**
   - `n + n` is simply `2 * n`.

### Output:
- The first value to be printed is `sum`, which is \(\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}\).
- The second value to be printed is `2 * n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **\(\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}\), 2 * n (where n is the input integer)**
