The code snippet `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` modifies the value of `sum` by adding the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to it. Let's break down the expression:

- `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1))` simplifies to `i * i - (i * i - 2 * i + 1)`, which further simplifies to `2 * i - 1`.
- Therefore, the expression becomes `(2 * i - 1) * i`.

Given that the initial state does not specify a value for `i`, we'll keep `i` as a variable in our output state.

The value of `sum` initially is 1. After the code execution, `sum` will be `1 + (2 * i - 1) * i`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 2, `sum` is `1 + (2 * i - 1) * i`**.
