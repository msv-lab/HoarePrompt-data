To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

Here's the provided for loop:
```python
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The `range(2, n + 1)` function generates numbers starting from 2 up to, but not including, `n + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2 because if `n` is less than 2, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

The variables `j`, `t`, and `sum` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted according to the given constraints.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

- `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.
- `i` does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` is an input integer + 1, `t` is t - 1, `sum` is 1**
