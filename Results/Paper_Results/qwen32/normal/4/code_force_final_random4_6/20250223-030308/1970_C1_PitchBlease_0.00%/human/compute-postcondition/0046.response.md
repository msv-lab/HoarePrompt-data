Output State: **`queue` has the same number of elements as initially, with an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` appended; `visited` contains all reachable nodes including `neighbor`; `current` is a node that has at least one neighbor; `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`; `start` and `target` remain unchanged; `tree[current]` is a list with at least one element, and `neighbor` is in `visited`.**

In simpler terms: The `queue` now includes an extra element, which is a tuple containing `neighbor` and the distance `dist + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
