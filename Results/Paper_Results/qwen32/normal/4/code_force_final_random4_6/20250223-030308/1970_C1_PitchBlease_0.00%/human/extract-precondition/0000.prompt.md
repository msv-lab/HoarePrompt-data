You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
