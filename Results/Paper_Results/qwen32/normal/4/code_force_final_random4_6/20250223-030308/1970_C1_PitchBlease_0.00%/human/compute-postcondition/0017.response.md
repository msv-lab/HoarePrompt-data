The code `visited.add(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` node to the `visited` set. This means that `neighbor` is now part of the `visited` set, and the state of `visited` is updated accordingly. All other variables (`start`, `target`, `tree`, `current`, `dist`, and `neighbor`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node to reach within the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes with `start` having at least one neighbor, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `current` is not equal to `target`, `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]`, `visited` includes `neighbor`.**
