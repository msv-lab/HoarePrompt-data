Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node to reach within the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes with `start` having at least one neighbor, `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start` and `neighbor`, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `current` is not equal to `target`, and `neighbor` is not in `visited` (previously true, now false as `neighbor` has been added to `visited`).**

In simple terms, the `queue` now contains a tuple with `neighbor` and `dist + 1`. The `visited` set now includes `neighbor`. All other variables remain unchanged.
