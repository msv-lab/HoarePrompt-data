The code appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. The value of `neighbor` is already in the `visited` set, indicating it has been visited before. The variables `start`, `target`, `tree`, `current`, `dist`, and `neighbor` remain unchanged except for the `queue` which now includes the new tuple.

Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node to reach within the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes with `start` having at least one neighbor, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `current` is not equal to `target`, `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]`, `visited` includes `neighbor`, `queue` includes `(neighbor, dist + 1)`**.
