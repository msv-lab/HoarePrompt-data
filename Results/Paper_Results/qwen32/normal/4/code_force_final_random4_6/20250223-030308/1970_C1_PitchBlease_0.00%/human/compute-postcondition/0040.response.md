The code snippet `current, dist = queue.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the `queue` and assigns it to `current` and `dist`. This means `queue` will have one less element after this operation. The values of `start` and `target` remain unchanged, and `visited` still contains all reachable nodes, but `current` and `dist` will now hold the values of the node and its distance from `start` that was just removed from the queue.

Output State: **`queue` has one less element, `visited` contains all reachable nodes, `current` is the node that was just removed from the queue, `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`, `start` and `target` remain unchanged.**
