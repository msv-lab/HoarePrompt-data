The code appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that `queue` now contains an additional element which is the `neighbor` node along with its distance from the `start` node, which is `dist + 1`.

The `visited` set and the `tree[current]` structure remain unchanged as they were not affected by the provided code snippet. The `start` and `target` nodes remain unchanged as well. The `current` node and its distance `dist` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` contains at least one tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances, including `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `visited` contains all visited nodes including `neighbor`, `current` is the first node from the `queue` and `tree[current]` must have at least two neighbors, `dist` is the distance from the `start` to `current`, `start` and `target` remain unchanged.**
