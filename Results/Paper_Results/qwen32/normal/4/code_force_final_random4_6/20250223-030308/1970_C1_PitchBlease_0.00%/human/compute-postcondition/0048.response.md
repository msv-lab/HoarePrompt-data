The only variable in the loop head is `neighbor`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `tree[current]`. If `tree[current]` has more than one element, the loop will execute again for the next neighbor.

At the end of the last iteration, `neighbor` is the last element that was processed in `tree[current]`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `tree[current]` must have at least one more element that hasn't been processed yet.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `neighbor` should be the next element in `tree[current]`.

State: **`queue` has the same number of elements as initially, with an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` appended if `neighbor` was not in `visited`; `visited` contains all reachable nodes, including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`; `current` is a node that has at least one neighbor; `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`; `start` and `target` remain unchanged; `tree[current]` is a list with at least one element; `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`**
