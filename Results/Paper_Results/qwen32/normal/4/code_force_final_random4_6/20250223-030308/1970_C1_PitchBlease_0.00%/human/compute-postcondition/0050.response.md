Output State: **`queue` has the same number of elements as initially, with an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` appended; `visited` contains all reachable nodes, including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited` before; `current` is a node that has at least one neighbor; `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`; `start` and `target` remain unchanged; `tree[current]` is a list with at least one element; `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`.**

Explanation: The `queue` now includes an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
