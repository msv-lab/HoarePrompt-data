Functionality: **The function `bfs` performs a Breadth-First Search to find the shortest path from a starting node (`start`) to a target node (`target`) in a tree represented as an adjacency list. It returns the distance from `start` to `target` if the target is reachable, or -1 if it is not. If `start` and `target` are the same, it returns 0.**
