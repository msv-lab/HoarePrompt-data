The only object in the loop head is the variable `neighbor`. According to the code, the loop iterates over each `neighbor` in `tree[current]`. To execute one more time, there must be another `neighbor` in `tree[current]` that hasn't been processed yet.

At the end of the last iteration, `current` is the first node from the `queue`, and `tree[current]` must have at least two neighbors. This means that after processing one neighbor, there is still at least one more neighbor left in `tree[current]` to be processed.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `neighbor` is set to the next neighbor in `tree[current]`.

State: **`queue` contains at least one tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances, including `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`. `visited` contains all visited nodes, including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`. `current` is the first node from the `queue` and `tree[current]` must have at least one more neighbor. `dist` is the distance from the `start` to `current`. `start` and `target` remain unchanged. `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]`.**
