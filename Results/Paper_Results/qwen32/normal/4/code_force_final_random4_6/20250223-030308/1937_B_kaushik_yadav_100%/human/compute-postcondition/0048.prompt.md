Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is an empty string; `i` is 0; `work` is True.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace. If `work` was initially True, then `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b` if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `ans` is the first character of `a`. `i` is 0 if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `i` is 1. `work` is False if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is True. If `work` was initially False, then `ans` is the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace. If `work` is True, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` concatenated with `a[i]`. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is set to False. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i] >= a[i + 1]`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `work` is set to True. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is further concatenated with `b[i]` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `work` is False, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` concatenated with `b[i]` and `i` is incremented by 1. `work` is then determined based on the new value of `i`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is a string that is being built based on the conditions described and now includes either `a[i]` or `b[i]` at the end; `i` is less than `len(a)`. If `work` was True and `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is set to False. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and must still be less than `len(a)`. If `work` was False, `ans` includes `b[i]` and `i` is incremented by 1. `work` is a boolean flag that determines how `ans` is updated and whether `i` is incremented.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
