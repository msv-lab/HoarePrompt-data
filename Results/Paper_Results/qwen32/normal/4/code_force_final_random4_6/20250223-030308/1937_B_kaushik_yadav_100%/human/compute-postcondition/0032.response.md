Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` concatenated with `a[i]`, and if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is further concatenated with `b[i]`. `i` is incremented by 1 if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`; `work` is False if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is True. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
