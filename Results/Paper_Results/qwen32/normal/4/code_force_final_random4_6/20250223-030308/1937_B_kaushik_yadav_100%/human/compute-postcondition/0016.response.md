The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `b` to the string `ans`. Given that `i` is 0, the character appended to `ans` is the first character of `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b`; `i` is 0 and `i + 1` equals the length of `a`; `work` is True and the current value of `work` is True.**

In simpler terms, `ans` now holds the first character of `a` followed by the first character of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
