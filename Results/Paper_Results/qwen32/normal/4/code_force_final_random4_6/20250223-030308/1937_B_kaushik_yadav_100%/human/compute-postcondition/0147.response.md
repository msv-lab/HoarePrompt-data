To determine what will be printed by the `print(counter)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a non-empty string with no leading or trailing whitespace.
- `b` is an input string with no leading or trailing whitespace.
- `ans` is a string constructed by alternating between characters from `a` and `b` based on loop conditions.
- `i` is equal to `len(a)`.
- `work` is `False`.
- `j` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `counter` reflects the number of consecutive matches of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` until the loop breaks or completes.

### Analysis:
The `counter` variable is meant to count the number of consecutive matches of characters from `a` and `b` in a specific pattern. However, the provided initial state does not include any loop or conditions that modify `counter`, and it does not specify an initial value for `counter`. Therefore, we must assume that `counter` is initialized to 0, which is a common default for counters in such scenarios.

Since no specific loop or conditions are provided in the initial state, and no other information suggests otherwise, `counter` remains at its initial value of 0.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the lack of any operations that modify `counter`, the value printed by `print(counter)` will be 0.

Output: **0**
