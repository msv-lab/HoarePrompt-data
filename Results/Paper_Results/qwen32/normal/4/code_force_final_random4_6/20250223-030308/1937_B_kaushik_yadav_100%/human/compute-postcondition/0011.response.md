The code snippet `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the string `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so the first character of `a` is appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is the first character of `a`; `i` is 0; `work` is True and the current value of `work` is True.**
