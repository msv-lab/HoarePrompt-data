Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is the input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is constructed based on the conditions: if `work` is True, `ans` is the initial `ans` concatenated with `a[i]` and `b[i]` if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, otherwise `ans` is the initial `ans` concatenated with `a[i]` only. If `work` is False, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with `b[i]` if `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is the first character of `b`, and now `ans` has `b[i]` appended to it; `i` is `len(a) - 2` if `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `i` is 1 if `i + 1` does not equal `len(a)` and `len(a)` is greater than 1, or `i` is 2 if `i + 1` equals `len(a)` and `len(a)` is greater than 1, or `i` is `len(a) - 1` if `work` is False and `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `i` is 2 if `work` is False; `work` is False; `j` is `len(a) - 1`; `counter` is the final count based on the conditions in the loop.**
