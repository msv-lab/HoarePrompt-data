Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is the updated input string with no leading or trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string starting with the first character of `a` followed by characters from `b` starting from the index where `work` was set to `False` or the end of `a`, `i` is `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`. If `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, then `counter` is incremented by 1. If `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'`, then `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
