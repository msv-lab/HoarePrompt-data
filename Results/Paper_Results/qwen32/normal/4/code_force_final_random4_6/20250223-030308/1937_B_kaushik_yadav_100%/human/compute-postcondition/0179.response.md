Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new input string with no leading or trailing whitespace and `a` is not an empty string; `b` is the updated input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `work` is False; `j` is len(a) - 1; `counter` reflects the number of consecutive matches of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` until the loop breaks or completes; `i` is such that i < len(a); if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is the previous value of `ans` concatenated with `a[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` concatenated with `b[i]` if `i + 1 == len(a)`, otherwise `ans` is the previous value of `ans` concatenated with `a[i]` and `i` is increased by 1.**
