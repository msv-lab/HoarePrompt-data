Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `a` is a non-empty string with no leading or trailing whitespace and at least 2 characters; `b` is a string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is a string constructed based on the conditions described; `i` is equal to `len(a)`; `work` is a boolean flag that can be either True or False; `counter` is 2 if `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`, otherwise `counter` is 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', the condition is met and `counter` is set to 2; otherwise, `counter` remains 1.**
