The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common placeholder for a variable that we don't plan to use) and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The state of `t` is already given as an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, which means the loop will definitely execute at least once.

Since the loop head only involves `t`, and `t` is already in a state that ensures the loop will execute, no further adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
