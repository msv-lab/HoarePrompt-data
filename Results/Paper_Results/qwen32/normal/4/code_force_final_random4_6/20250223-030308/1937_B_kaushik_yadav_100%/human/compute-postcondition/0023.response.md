The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `b` to the string `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the first character of `b` is appended to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is the first character of `b`; `i` is 0; `work` is False**.
