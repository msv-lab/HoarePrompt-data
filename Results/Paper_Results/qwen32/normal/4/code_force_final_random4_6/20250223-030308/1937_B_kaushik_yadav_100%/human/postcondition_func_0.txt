The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two binary strings of equal length. For each test case, it constructs a new string based on specific conditions and prints this string. It then calculates and prints the number of consecutive positions starting from the beginning where the characters in the two binary strings are either the same or differ in a specific pattern.
