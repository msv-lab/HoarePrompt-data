t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The first binary string a_11 a_12 ... a_1n consists of n characters, each of which is either '0' or '1'. The second binary string a_21 a_22 ... a_2n consists of n characters, each of which is either '0' or '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
