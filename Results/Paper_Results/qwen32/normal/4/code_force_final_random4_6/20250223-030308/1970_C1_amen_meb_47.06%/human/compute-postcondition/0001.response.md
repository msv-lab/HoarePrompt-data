In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will execute indefinitely as long as the program does not encounter a `break` statement or similar exit condition inside the loop. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are needed to ensure that the first iteration of the loop can proceed.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `numbers` is an empty list.**
