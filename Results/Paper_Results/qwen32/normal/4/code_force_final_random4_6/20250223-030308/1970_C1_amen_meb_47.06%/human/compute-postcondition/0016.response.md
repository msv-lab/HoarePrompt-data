In the given task, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement inside the loop body. Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine if there is a `break` statement, and we must assume that the loop will continue to execute.

Given that the loop is `while True`, no modifications are needed to the program state for the loop to proceed to the next iteration. The loop will always execute as long as the program does not encounter a `break` statement.

Therefore, the state at the end of the previous iteration can be repeated as is.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `numbers` is a list containing two elements `[[num1, num2], [num1, num2]]`; `nums` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `num1` is the integer value of `nums[0]`; `num2` is the integer value of `nums[1]`.**
