For the provided `while True` loop, the loop condition is always `True`, meaning the loop will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement inside the loop body (which is not provided here). Therefore, no changes to the program state are necessary to ensure that the next iteration of the loop can proceed.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we can simply repeat it as the state for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `numbers` is a list containing one element `[num1, num2]`; `nums` is a list of strings; `num1` is the integer value of `nums[0]`; `num2` is the integer value of `nums[1]`.**
