Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `numbers` is a list containing two elements `[[num1, num2], [num1, num2]]`; `nums` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `num1` is the integer value of `nums[0]`; `num2` is the integer value of `nums[1]`.**  
The list `numbers` now contains two sublists, each with the values `[num1, num2]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
