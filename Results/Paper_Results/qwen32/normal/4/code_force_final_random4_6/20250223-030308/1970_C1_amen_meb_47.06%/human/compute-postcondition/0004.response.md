Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `numbers` is an empty list; `nums` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line. The length of `nums` is not equal to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
