The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `numbers`. This action does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `t`, the edges of the tree, and the starting node `u_1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `numbers` is an empty list.**
