### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate or inaccurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The operations allow us to set a row or a column to any permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Matrix Initialization**:
   ```python
   mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
   ```
   This initializes the matrix with rows filled in ascending order (e.g., for \( n = 2 \), the matrix is initialized as:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix}
   1 & 2 \\
   1 & 2 \\
   \end{bmatrix}
   \])

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   ```python
   res = 0
   for i in range(n):
       res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
   ```
   This calculates the sum using the formula \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\). This formula does not seem to directly maximize the sum of the matrix elements.

3. **Operations Output**:
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 0, -1):
       print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
       print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```
   This outputs \( 2n \) operations, setting each row and column to the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm the program's behavior:
- The matrix is initialized with ascending order.
- The sum is calculated using the provided formula.
- The operations are output as specified.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims the program is incorrect because:
- It does not maximize the sum.
- It uses an incorrect strategy for filling the matrix.

#### Evaluation:
1. **Maximizing the Sum**:
   - The optimal strategy to maximize the sum is to fill each row and column with the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\).
   - This ensures that the highest numbers are placed in the matrix, maximizing the sum.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The provided sum calculation formula \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) does not yield the maximum possible sum.
   - The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\) in each row and column is \(\frac{n(n^2 + 1)}{2}\).

3. **Operations**:
   - The operations output by the program do not achieve the optimal configuration.
   - The correct operations should set each row to \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\).

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **correct**. The provided program does not maximize the sum of the matrix and uses an incorrect strategy for filling the matrix. The correct approach involves filling each row and column with the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\) and recalculating the sum accordingly.

### Final: **False**
