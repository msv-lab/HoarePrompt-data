The given loop iterates from `n` down to `1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. Since `n` is `5`, the loop will execute 5 times, with `i` taking values 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 in successive iterations. 

The provided output states show the state after the first three iterations. Following this pattern, we can deduce the state after all iterations:

1. After the 4th iteration, `i` will be 2 (as per the given state after 3 iterations).
2. After the 5th iteration, `i` will be 1.

No other variables in the initial state are affected by the loop body. Therefore, after the loop completes all iterations, the state will be:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is 5, `mat` is a list of 5 lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to 5, `res` is 95, `i` is 1**

In simple terms, the loop runs 5 times, decrementing `i` from 5 to 1. The final value of `i` after all iterations is 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
