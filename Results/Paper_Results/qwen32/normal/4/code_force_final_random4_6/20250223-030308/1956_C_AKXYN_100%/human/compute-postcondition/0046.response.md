The given Python code snippet modifies the `mat` variable by reassigning it to a new list of lists. This new list consists of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Given that `n` is an input integer, the new `mat` will be a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 95, `i` is 1.**
