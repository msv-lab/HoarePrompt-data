The code snippet modifies the value of `res` by adding the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it. Given that `i` is 3, we can calculate the new value of `res` as follows:

`(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) = (3 + 1) * (2 * 3 + 1) = 4 * 7 = 28`

The initial value of `res` is 21, so after the operation, `res` becomes `21 + 28 = 49`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `mat`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 49, `i` is 3**.
