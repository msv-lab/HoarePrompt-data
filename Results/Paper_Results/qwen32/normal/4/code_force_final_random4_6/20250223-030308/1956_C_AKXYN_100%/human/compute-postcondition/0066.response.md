To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the provided loop and the given output states after the first few iterations. 

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it performs the following:
1. Reads an integer `n` representing the size of the matrix.
2. Initializes a matrix `mat` of size `n x n` where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`.
3. Computes a value `res` which is the sum of the series \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)\).
4. Prints `res` and `n << 1` (which is `2 * n`).
5. Prints a series of commands involving the matrix, where it prints `1 i` followed by the row elements and then `2 i` followed by the row elements for `i` from `n` to 1.

Given the output states after the first three iterations:
- After the first iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `res` is 22, and `i` is 0.
- After the second iteration, `n` is 5, `res` is 95, and `i` is 1.
- After the third iteration, `n` is an input integer, `res` is \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)\), and `i` is 1.

After all `t` iterations, the final output state will be determined by the last test case processed. The variables `n`, `mat`, `res`, and `i` will reflect the values from the last test case.

To summarize the final output state:
- `t` will be the total number of test cases.
- `n` will be the size of the matrix for the last test case.
- `mat` will be the matrix for the last test case, which is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`.
- `res` will be the sum of the series \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)\) for the last test case.
- `i` will be 1, as it is the last value of `i` in the loop that prints the matrix rows.

The final output state will be the result of the last test case processed, which includes printing `res` and `2 * n`, followed by the series of commands involving the matrix rows.

Output State: **The final output state includes the values of `res` and `2 * n` for the last test case, followed by the series of commands involving the matrix rows for the last test case.**
