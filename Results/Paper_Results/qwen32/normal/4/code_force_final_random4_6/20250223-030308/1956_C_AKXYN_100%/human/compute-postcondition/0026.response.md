In the provided for loop, the loop head only involves the variable `i` and the range `n`. Therefore, the only states we need to adjust are related to `i` and `n` for the loop to execute.

Given the current state:
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`
- `res` is 0
- `i` is 0

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `i` is already set to 0, which is the correct starting point for the range function.

Therefore, the state does not need any adjustments related to `i` as it is already correctly initialized. However, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 to make sure the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 0, `i` is 0**
