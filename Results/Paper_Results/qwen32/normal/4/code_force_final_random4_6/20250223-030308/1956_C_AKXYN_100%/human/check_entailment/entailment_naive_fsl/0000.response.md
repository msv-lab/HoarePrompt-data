Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix for all possible cases. The program assumes a specific pattern for filling the matrix, but this pattern does not necessarily yield the maximum possible sum for all values of \( n \).

To maximize the sum, we should aim to place the largest possible numbers in the matrix. The optimal strategy is to fill each row and column with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1] because the sum of the first n natural numbers is maximized when they are placed in descending order.

Let's analyze the provided program:
- The program fills the matrix with rows in ascending order (e.g., for n=2, it fills the first row with [1, 2] and the second row with [1, 2]).
- It then calculates the sum based on the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, which is not the optimal sum for the matrix.

For \( n = 2 \):
- The provided program outputs a sum of 7, which is correct.
- The operations are:
  1. Set row 2 to [1, 2].
  2. Set row 1 to [1, 2].
  3. Set column 2 to [1, 2].
  4. Set column 1 to [1, 2].

However, the optimal operations would be:
1. Set row 1 to [2, 1].
2. Set row 2 to [2, 1].

This would result in the matrix:
```
2 1
2 1
```
with a sum of 6, which is incorrect. The correct sum should be 10:
```
2 1
1 2
```

For a correct implementation, we should fill each row and column with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1]. Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        mat = [list(range(n, 0, -1)) for _ in range(n)]
        res = n * (n * n + 1) // 2
        print(res, n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', i, *mat[i-1])

func()
```

This program fills each row with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1] and then outputs the operations, ensuring the maximum sum.
