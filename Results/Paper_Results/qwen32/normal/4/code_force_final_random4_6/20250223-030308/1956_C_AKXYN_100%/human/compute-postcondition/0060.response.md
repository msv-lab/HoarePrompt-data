Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`.
- `res` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)\).
- `i` is \(n-1\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`'1 %d' % i`**: 
   - This part of the `print` statement formats the string `'1 %d'` by replacing `%d` with the value of `i`.
   - Since `i` is \(n-1\), this part of the output will be `'1 %d' % (n-1)` which evaluates to the string `'1 n-1'`.

2. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**:
   - The `*` operator unpacks the range object into individual elements.
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - Therefore, `*range(1, n + 1)` will print each integer from 1 to `n` as separate arguments.

### Final Output:
Combining the two parts:
- The first part is the string `'1 n-1'`.
- The second part is the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

### Example:
If `n` were 5:
- `i` would be `5-1 = 4`.
- The first part of the output would be `'1 4'`.
- The second part would be the sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

### General Output:
For a general `n`, the output would be:
- `'1 n-1'` followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1 n-1 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the input integer)**
