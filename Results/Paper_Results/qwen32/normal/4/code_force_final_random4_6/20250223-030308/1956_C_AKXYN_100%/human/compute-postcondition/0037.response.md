The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration and continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to 3.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is 5, `mat` is a list of 5 lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to 5, `res` is 95, `i` is 3**
