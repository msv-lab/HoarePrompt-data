Let's break down the given code snippet and initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than or equal to 1 (though `t` is not used in the provided print statement).
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`.
4. `res` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)\).
5. `i` is set to \(n-1\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`'2 %d' % i`**: This part of the code formats the string `'2'` followed by the integer value of `i`. Since `i` is set to \(n-1\), this part will output `'2 n-1'`.

2. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**: This part of the code unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and prints each number in the range separated by a space. 

### Example:
If `n` is 5:
- `i` would be \(5-1 = 4\).
- The range `range(1, 5+1)` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

Thus, the print statement would output:
- `'2 4'` (formatted string with `i` as 4).
- Followed by the unpacked range: `1 2 3 4 5`.

### General Case:
For any `n`, the output will be:
- `'2 n-1'` (formatted string with `i` as \(n-1\)).
- Followed by the unpacked range from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 n-1 1 2 3 ... n (where n-1 is the value of i and the range is from 1 to n inclusive)**
