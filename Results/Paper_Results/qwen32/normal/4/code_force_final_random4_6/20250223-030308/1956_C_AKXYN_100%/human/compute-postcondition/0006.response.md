The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 1, and `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 1, `i` is 1**
