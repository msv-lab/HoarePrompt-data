To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the components step by step based on the initial state provided.

1. **Understanding the `print` Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is: `print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`
   - This statement consists of two parts:
     - `'2 %d' % i`: This is a formatted string where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer, which will be replaced by the value of `i`.
     - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This will print all the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

2. **Values of Variables:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `n` is given to be greater than 2, but its exact value is not specified. However, for the sake of this example, let's assume `n` is 5 (since it must be greater than 2, and we need a concrete value for the explanation).

3. **Formatted String:**
   - `'2 %d' % i`: Substituting `i` with 0, this becomes `'2 0'`.

4. **Range Function:**
   - `range(1, n + 1)`: Since `n` is 5, this will generate numbers from 1 to 5 (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator unpacks the range into separate arguments for the `print` function, so it will print each number in the range individually.

5. **Combining the Parts:**
   - The `print` statement will first print `'2 0'` followed by the numbers 1 through 5.

Given the above steps, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **2 0 1 2 3 4 5**
