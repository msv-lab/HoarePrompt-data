Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State
- `t` is greater than or equal to 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`. However, `mat` is not used in the print statement.
- `res` is 22, but it is also not used in the print statement.
- `i` is 1.

### Print Statement
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Breakdown of the Print Statement
1. `'1 %d' % i`: This part of the statement formats the integer `i` into a string and prepends it with '1 '. Since `i` is 1, this will result in the string `'1 1'`.
2. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This part of the statement generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and unpacks them into the print statement. Since `n` is greater than 2, the range will include at least the numbers 1, 2, and 3. For the sake of precision, let's assume `n` is 3 (the smallest possible value greater than 2). This will result in the sequence `1, 2, 3`.

### Combining the Parts
The `print` statement will combine the formatted string `'1 1'` with the sequence `1, 2, 3`, resulting in the output:
```
1 1 1 2 3
```

### Final Output
Output: **1 1 1 2 3**
