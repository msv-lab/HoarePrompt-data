Let's break down the given code snippet and determine what will be printed based on the initial state provided:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `t` is greater than or equal to 1 (not directly used in the print statement).
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n` (not directly used in the print statement).
   - `res` is 22 (not directly used in the print statement).
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Print statement:**
   ```python
   print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Analysis of the print statement:**
   - `'2 %d' % i`: This part formats the string by replacing `%d` with the value of `i`. Since `i` is 1, this part will be `'2 1'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This part generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and unpacks them as separate arguments to the `print` function. Since `n` is greater than 2, the sequence will include at least the numbers 1, 2, and 3.

4. **Combining the parts:**
   - The `print` function will output the string `'2 1'` followed by the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Given that `n` is greater than 2, the smallest possible value for `n` is 3. Therefore, the sequence generated by `range(1, n + 1)` will be `1, 2, 3`.

**Final Output:**
Output: **2 1 1 2 3**
