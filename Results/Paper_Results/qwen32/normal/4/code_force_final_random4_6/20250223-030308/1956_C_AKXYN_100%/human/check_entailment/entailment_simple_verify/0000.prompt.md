You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix for all possible cases. The program assumes a specific pattern for filling the matrix, but this pattern does not necessarily yield the maximum possible sum for all values of \( n \).

To maximize the sum, we should aim to place the largest possible numbers in the matrix. The optimal strategy is to fill each row and column with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1] because the sum of the first n natural numbers is maximized when they are placed in descending order.

Let's analyze the provided program:
- The program fills the matrix with rows in ascending order (e.g., for n=2, it fills the first row with [1, 2] and the second row with [1, 2]).
- It then calculates the sum based on the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, which is not the optimal sum for the matrix.

For \( n = 2 \):
- The provided program outputs a sum of 7, which is correct.
- The operations are:
  1. Set row 2 to [1, 2].
  2. Set row 1 to [1, 2].
  3. Set column 2 to [1, 2].
  4. Set column 1 to [1, 2].

However, the optimal operations would be:
1. Set row 1 to [2, 1].
2. Set row 2 to [2, 1].

This would result in the matrix:
```
2 1
2 1
```
with a sum of 6, which is incorrect. The correct sum should be 10:
```
2 1
1 2
```

For a correct implementation, we should fill each row and column with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1]. Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        mat = [list(range(n, 0, -1)) for _ in range(n)]
        res = n * (n * n + 1) // 2
        print(res, n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', i, *mat[i-1])

func()
```

This program fills each row with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1] and then outputs the operations, ensuring the maximum sum.
