The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `t`, `mat`, and `res` does not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, to ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is the loop variable that will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 0, `i` is 0**
