The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range parameters `n` and `0`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates from `n` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by `1` in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by `1`, so `i` should be `n-1`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `mat`, and `res` do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not change the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)\), `i` is \(n-1\)**
