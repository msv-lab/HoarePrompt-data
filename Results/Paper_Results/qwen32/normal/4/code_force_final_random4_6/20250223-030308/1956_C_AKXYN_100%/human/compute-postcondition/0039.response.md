Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet)
- `n` is 5
- `mat` is a list of 5 lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to 5 (though `mat` is not used in the provided code snippet)
- `res` is 95 (though `res` is not used in the provided code snippet)
- `i` is 3

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`'2 %d' % i`**:
   - This is a string formatting operation.
   - `%d` is a placeholder for an integer.
   - `i` is provided as the value for the placeholder.
   - Given `i` is 3, the string `'2 %d' % i` will be formatted to `'2 3'`.

2. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**:
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - Given `n` is 5, `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into individual arguments for the `print` function.
   - Therefore, `*range(1, n + 1)` will be unpacked to `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

### Combined Output:
- The `print` statement will first print the formatted string `'2 3'`, followed by the unpacked sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.
- The final output will be a single line with these values separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 3 1 2 3 4 5**
