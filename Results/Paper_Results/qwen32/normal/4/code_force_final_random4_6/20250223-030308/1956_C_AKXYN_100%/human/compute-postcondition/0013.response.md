Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state step-by-step to determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n` (though `mat` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `res` is 22 (though `res` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `i` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Explanation:
1. **`'1 %d' % i`**:
   - This is a string formatting operation where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer.
   - `i` is given as 2.
   - So, `'1 %d' % i` evaluates to `'1 2'`.

2. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**:
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 2, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` which is 3 (as it's the smallest integer greater than 2).
   - Therefore, `range(1, n + 1)` becomes `range(1, 4)`, which generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, so `*range(1, n + 1)` results in `1 2 3`.

### Combining the Results:
- The `print` statement combines the formatted string `'1 2'` with the unpacked sequence `1 2 3`.
- Therefore, the final output will be `'1 2 1 2 3'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2 1 2 3**
