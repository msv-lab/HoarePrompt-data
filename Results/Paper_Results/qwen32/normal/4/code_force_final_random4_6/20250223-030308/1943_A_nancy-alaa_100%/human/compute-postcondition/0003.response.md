The code snippet creates a `Counter` object from the list `arr`. This `Counter` object, `mpp`, will hold the count of each unique integer in the list `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, but `mpp` is introduced and populated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input line and converting each split component to an integer; `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.**
