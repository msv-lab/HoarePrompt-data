The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `arr`. This operation does not affect the variables `n`, `mpp`, `first`, or `i` as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; the loop prints the first integer `i` that is not in `mpp.keys()` or the first integer `i` such that `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`. The variable `first` will be `True` if an integer `i` with `mpp[i] == 1` has been encountered, and the variable `i` will be the last value it took before the loop broke. The loop has not yet exhausted the number of iterations specified by `int(input())`. `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
