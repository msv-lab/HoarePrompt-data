The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then prints the smallest integer from 0 to `n` that either does not appear in the list or appears exactly once, with the condition that if multiple integers appear exactly once, the smallest one after the first occurrence is chosen.
