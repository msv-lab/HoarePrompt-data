Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces; `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`; `first` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be at least 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is True if and only if `mpp[i]` was 1 and `i` was not a key in `mpp` before the if statement, and `i` becomes a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1 if `first` was True and `mpp[i]` was 1. Otherwise, the state of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `i` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be at least `i + 1`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is `True`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `i` was not a key in `mpp` before the if statement, `i` becomes a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1. Otherwise, `first` remains unchanged. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1, the program does not break out of the loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be at least `i + 2`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is `i + 2`. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
