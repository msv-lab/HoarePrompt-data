Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `n` is at least 1.
2. `i` is initialized to `n`.
3. `mpp` and `first` remain unchanged.
4. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the most internal loop or if statement breaks.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is initialized to the value of `n`.
- The condition `if i is not in mpp.keys()` suggests that the code is likely part of a loop or a conditional block that checks whether `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp`. However, this condition does not affect the value of `i` itself.
- Since the `print(i)` statement is reached, it means that the condition `if i is not in mpp.keys()` did not cause the loop or if statement to break, or the `print(i)` statement is outside of such a block.
- Therefore, the value of `i` that gets printed is the value it was initialized to, which is `n`.

### Conclusion:
The code will print the value of `i`, which is `n`.

### Output:
Output: **n (where n is the initial value assigned to i)**
