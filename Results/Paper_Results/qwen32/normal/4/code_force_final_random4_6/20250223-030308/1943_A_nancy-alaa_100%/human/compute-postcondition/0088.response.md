Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is True if and only if `mpp[i]` was 1 and `i` was not a key in `mpp` before the if statement, and `i` becomes a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1 if `first` was True and `mpp[i]` was 1. Otherwise, the state of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `i` remains unchanged.**
