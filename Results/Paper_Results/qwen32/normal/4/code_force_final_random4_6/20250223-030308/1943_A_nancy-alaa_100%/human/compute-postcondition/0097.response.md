Postcondition: **`n` must be at least `i + 1`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is `True`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `i` was not a key in `mpp` before the if statement, `i` becomes a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1. Otherwise, `first` remains unchanged. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1, the program does not break out of the loop or if statement.**
