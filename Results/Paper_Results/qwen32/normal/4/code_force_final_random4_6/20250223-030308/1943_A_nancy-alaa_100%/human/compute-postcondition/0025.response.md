Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input line and converting each split component to an integer; `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`; `first` is a boolean; `i` is `i + 1`. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1, no changes are made to the variables.**
