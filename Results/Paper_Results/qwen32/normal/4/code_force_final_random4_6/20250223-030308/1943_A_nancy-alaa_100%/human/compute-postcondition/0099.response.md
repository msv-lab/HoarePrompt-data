To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, let's analyze the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be at least `i + 2`. This means `n` is defined in terms of `i` and must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces.
   - `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
   - `first` is set to `True`.
   - `i` is updated to `i + 2`.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `i` is not explicitly given in the initial state, but it is updated to `i + 2`.
   - Since `i` is not initialized with a specific value, we can only describe its final value in terms of its initial value.

3. **Determine what is printed:**
   - The print statement `print(i)` will output the current value of `i` after it has been updated to `i + 2`.

Given that `i` is not provided with an initial value, we can only express the printed value in terms of its initial state. Therefore, if `i` was initially some value `x`, after the update, the value of `i` will be `x + 2`.

Output: **i (where i is the initial value of i plus 2)**
