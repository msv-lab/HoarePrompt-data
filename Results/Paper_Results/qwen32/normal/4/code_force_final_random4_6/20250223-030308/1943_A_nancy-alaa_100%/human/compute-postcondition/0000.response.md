In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range determined by the integer `t`, which is obtained from the input. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Since the loop head does not involve `n`, `a`, or the list of integers `a_i`, we only need to ensure that `t` is set correctly for the loop to execute.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will execute `int(input())` times.
2. **State Adjustment**: To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be a valid integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate, so no specific state adjustment is needed for it.
3. **Input Requirement**: The loop will execute `t` times, so `t` must be set to a value that satisfies the condition for the loop to run at least once.

Given the above points, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is a valid integer within the specified range. The other variables `n` and `a` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4**
