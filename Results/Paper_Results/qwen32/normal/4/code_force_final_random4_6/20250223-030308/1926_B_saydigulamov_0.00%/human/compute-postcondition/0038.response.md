Postcondition: **`a` remains the initial input value; `k` is a list of counts of '1's from each string `b` that contained '1's; `i` is equal to `a`. If `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`, then the condition is met but no further changes occur to the variables. Otherwise, no changes occur as there is no else part.**
