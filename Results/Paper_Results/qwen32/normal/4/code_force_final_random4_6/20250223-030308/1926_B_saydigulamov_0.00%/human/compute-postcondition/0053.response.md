Postcondition: **`a` remains the initial input value; `i` is equal to `a + 1`; `b` is the new string provided by the user input; `k` is a list with the previous counts of '1' in `b` plus the new count of '1' in the newly provided `b` if `b` contains '1`, otherwise `k` is an empty list; the number of remaining iterations is one less than the previous input value.**
