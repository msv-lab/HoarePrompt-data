`b` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means `b` will hold the string value provided by the user input. The values of `a`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` remains the initial input value, `k` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `a + 1`, and `b` is the string provided by the user input.
Output State: **`a` remains the initial input value, `k` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `a + 1`, `b` is the string provided by the user input.**
