Postcondition: **`a` remains the initial input value; `i` is equal to `a + 1`; `b` is the new string provided by the user input. If `b` contains the character '1', `k` is a list with the previous counts of '1' in `b` plus the new count of '1' in the newly provided `b`. Otherwise, `k` is an empty list.**
