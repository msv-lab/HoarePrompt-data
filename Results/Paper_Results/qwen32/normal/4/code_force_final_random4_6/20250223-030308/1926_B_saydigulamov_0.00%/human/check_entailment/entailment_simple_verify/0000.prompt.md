You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the n x n grid. This is followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one shape, which is either a triangle or a square, and this shape is composed of all the '1's in the grid. The size of the shape (k) is greater than 1, meaning the shape cannot consist of a single '1'.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: `a` remains the initial input value, and `i` is equal to `a`. The list `k` is recalculated in each iteration but is only printed if `k[0]` equals `k[1]`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incomplete Logic**: The program only checks if the counts of consecutive '1's in the first two rows are equal and prints the list `k` if they are. This is a very limited check and does not cover the full criteria for identifying a square or a triangle.

2. **Output Mismatch**: The program is supposed to output either "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE", but it prints the list `k` instead of the required string.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle various edge cases, such as:
   - Upside-down triangles.
   - Triangles that are not centered.
   - Squares that are not aligned with the left edge of the grid.
   - Grids with no '1's or with '1's not forming a valid square or triangle.

### Example of a Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
111
111
111
```
The program should output "SQUARE" because all '1's form a 3x3 square. However, the program will print `[3, 3, 3]` instead of "SQUARE".

### Correct Implementation Example:
Here's a more complete implementation that checks for both squares and triangles:
```python
def func():
    def is_square(grid):
        n = len(grid)
        k = None
        for row in grid:
            count = row.count('1')
            if count == 0:
                continue
            if k is None:
                k = count
            elif count != k:
                return False
        return k > 1

    def is_triangle(grid):
        n = len(grid)
        k = None
        for i, row in enumerate(grid):
            count = row.count('1')
            if count == 0:
                continue
            if k is None:
                k = count
            elif count != 2 * i + 1:
                return False
        return k > 1

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        if is_square(grid):
            print("SQUARE")
        elif is_triangle(grid):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        else:
            print("UNKNOWN")

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This implementation correctly checks for both squares and triangles based on the problem description and handles various edge cases.
