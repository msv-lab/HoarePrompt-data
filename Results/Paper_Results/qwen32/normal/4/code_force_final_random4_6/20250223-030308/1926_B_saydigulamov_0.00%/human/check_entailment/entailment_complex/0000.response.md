Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. The program only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows is equal and prints the list of counts under that condition. However, this check is not sufficient to determine the shape. 

To correctly determine the shape, the program should:
1. Identify the rows that contain '1's.
2. Check if the number of '1's in each row matches the pattern of a square or a triangle.
3. For a square, all rows with '1's should have the same number of '1's.
4. For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should follow the pattern of an increasing or decreasing sequence of odd numbers.

Given the current implementation, the program does not perform these checks and only prints the counts of '1's in the first two rows if they are equal. This does not provide the correct output as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
