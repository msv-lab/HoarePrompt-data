Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the n x n grid. This is followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one shape, which is either a triangle or a square, and this shape is composed of all the '1's in the grid. The size of the shape (k) is greater than 1, meaning the shape cannot consist of a single '1'.**
