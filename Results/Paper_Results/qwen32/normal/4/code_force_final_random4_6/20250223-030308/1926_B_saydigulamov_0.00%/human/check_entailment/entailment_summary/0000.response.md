Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. The logic in the given code is flawed and does not match the problem requirements. Specifically, the program only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows is equal and prints the counts if they are equal. This does not help in identifying whether the shape is a square or a triangle.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
1. Identify the dimensions and position of the shape formed by '1's.
2. Verify if the shape fits the criteria for either a square or a triangle.

The current implementation does not perform these steps and instead only prints the counts of '1's in the first two rows when they are equal, which is not a valid solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
