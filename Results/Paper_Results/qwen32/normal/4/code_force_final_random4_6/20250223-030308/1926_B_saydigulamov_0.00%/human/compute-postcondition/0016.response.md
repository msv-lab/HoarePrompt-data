To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided information.

The loop iterates `a` times, where `a` is the size of the n x n grid provided as the first integer input. During each iteration, a string `b` is input. If `b` contains the character '1', the count of '1' in `b` is appended to the list `k`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.

Given that the loop iterates `a` times, the final state of `k` will be a list containing the counts of '1's from all the input strings `b` that contain at least one '1'.

Here is the final output state in the required format:

Output State: **`a` is assigned the value of the first integer input, representing the size of the n x n grid, and `a` must be greater than 0; `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from all the input strings `b` that contain at least one '1'.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `a` retains its initial value (the size of the grid), and `k` is a list that includes the number of '1's from each input string that had at least one '1'.
