The code snippet `cnt = 0` resets the value of the variable `cnt` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `s1`, `t1`, `i`, and `d` if it exists) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a new string input by the user; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is the new string input by the user; `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`; `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`; `cnt` is 0; `i` is `n-1` based on the original `n`; if the count of '1's in the new `s` is equal to the count of '1's in the new `t`, no additional variable `d` is defined. Otherwise, `d` is defined as the absolute difference between the new `s1` and `t1`.**
