The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `s1`, `t1`, and `cnt`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is a string input by the user; `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is a string input by the user; `s1` is the count of '1's in `s`; `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`; `cnt` is 0; `i` is 0**
