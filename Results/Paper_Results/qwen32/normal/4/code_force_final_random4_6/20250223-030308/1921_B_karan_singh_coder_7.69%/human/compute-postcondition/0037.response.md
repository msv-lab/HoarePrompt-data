The code snippet `d = abs(s1 - t1)` calculates the absolute difference between the count of '1's in the string `s` and the count of '1's in the string `t`. This value is then assigned to the variable `d`.

Output State: **`t` is a new string input by the user; `n` is a new input integer; `s` is the new string input by the user; `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`; `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`; `cnt` is the total number of positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `i` is `n-1`; the count of '1's in the new `s` is not equal to the count of '1's in the new `t`; `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**
