The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is the new string input by the user, `n` is the new input integer (must be greater than 0), `s` is the new string input by the user, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1 plus 1 if `s[1]` is not equal to `t[1]`, `i` is 2**
