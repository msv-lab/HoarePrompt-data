The code snippet `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments `cnt` by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are not equal. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so we compare `s[1]` and `t[1]`.

If `s[1]` is not equal to `t[1]`, `cnt` will be incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a string input by the user; `n` must be greater than 1; `s` is a string input by the user; `s1` is the count of '1's in `s`; `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`; `cnt` is 1 if `s[0] != t[0]` else `cnt` is 0, and `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[1] != t[1]`; `i` is 1**
