The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a string input by the user; `n` must be greater than 1; `s` is a string input by the user; `s1` is the count of '1's in `s`; `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`; `cnt` is 1 if `s[0] != t[0]` else `cnt` is 0; `i` is 1**
