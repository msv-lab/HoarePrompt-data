Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 2; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while x != 0:
    i = 0
    while 2 ** i <= x:
        i += 1
    if i == 0:
        break
    else:
        subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
        x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
        mx = max(mx, i - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an integer; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i - 1` if `i` is not 0; `i` is the smallest integer such that 2, and if `i` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is any non-zero integer; `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or a list containing `i - 1`; `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` or `i - 1`; `i` is the smallest integer such that `2^i` is greater than or equal to `x`. If `i` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `x` is reduced by the highest power of 2 less than `x`, `subseq_lens` contains `i - 1`, and `mx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is the smallest integer such that 2. If `i` is 0, then `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `i` is 2, `subseq_lens` contains the value 1, `x` is decreased by 2, and `mx` is the maximum of its current value and 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
