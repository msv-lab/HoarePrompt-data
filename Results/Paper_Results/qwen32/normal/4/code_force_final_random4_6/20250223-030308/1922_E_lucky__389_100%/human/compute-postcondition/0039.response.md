Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is any non-zero integer; `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or a list containing `i - 1`; `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` or `i - 1`; `i` is the smallest integer such that `2^i` is greater than or equal to `x`. If `i` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `x` is reduced by the highest power of 2 less than `x`, `subseq_lens` contains `i - 1`, and `mx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i - 1`.**
