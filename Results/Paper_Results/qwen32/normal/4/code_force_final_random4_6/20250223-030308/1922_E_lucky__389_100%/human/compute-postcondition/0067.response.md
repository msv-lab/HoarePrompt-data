To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State and Variables:
1. **`t`**: An integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. **`X`**: For each test case, `X` is an integer such that \(2 \leq X \leq 10^{18}\).
3. **`x`**: Initialized to 0 (though it is not used in the given print statement).
4. **`subseq_lens`**: A list containing the lengths of all subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to the original `X` for each test case.
5. **`mx`**: The maximum length of these subsequences.
6. **`ansv`**: A list containing elements from `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens) - 1]` and must have at least one element.
7. **`i`**: Initialized to 0.

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is `print(ansv[i], end=' ')`. This means it will print the element at index `i` of the list `ansv`, followed by a space.
- Given that `i` is initialized to 0, the statement will print `ansv[0]`.

### Value of `ansv[0]`:
- `ansv` is defined as a list containing elements from `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens) - 1]`.
- Since `ansv` must have at least one element, `subseq_lens` must have at least two elements (because `ansv` starts from index 1 of `subseq_lens`).

### Conclusion:
- The first element of `ansv` (i.e., `ansv[0]`) is `subseq_lens[1]`.
- `subseq_lens[1]` represents the length of the second subsequence of powers of 2 that sums up to `X` for the current test case.

### Output:
Based on the given information, the output will be the value of `subseq_lens[1]`, which is the length of the second subsequence of powers of 2 that sums up to `X`.

Output: **subseq_lens[1] (where subseq_lens[1] is the length of the second subsequence of powers of 2 that sums up to X for the current test case)**
