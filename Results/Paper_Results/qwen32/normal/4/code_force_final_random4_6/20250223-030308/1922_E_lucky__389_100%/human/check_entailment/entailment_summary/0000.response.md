### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by decomposing the given integer \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2. It then constructs an array based on these power values. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Decomposition of \( X \)**:
   - The program correctly identifies the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( X \) and subtracts it from \( X \).
   - It repeats this process until \( X \) becomes 0, effectively decomposing \( X \) into a sum of distinct powers of 2.
   - This is a correct approach because any positive integer can be uniquely represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (binary representation).

2. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The program constructs an array where each element corresponds to the exponent of the power of 2 used in the decomposition.
   - It starts with an array of consecutive integers from 0 to \( mx-1 \), where \( mx \) is the maximum exponent found in the decomposition.
   - It then appends the exponents from the decomposition (excluding the first one) to the array.
   - The resulting array is supposed to have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case when \( X = 2 \) by printing `1` and `0`, which indeed has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the array followed by the array itself.
   - The output format matches the problem's requirements.

### Issues in the Program:

However, there is a logical flaw in the program's construction of the array:
- The program does not ensure that the array has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. It simply constructs an array based on the exponents found in the decomposition, which does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences.
- The problem requires constructing an array such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \). The current approach does not achieve this.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning and the identified issues, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all valid inputs \( X \).

**Correctness: False**
