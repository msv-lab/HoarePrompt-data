The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which will exit the innermost loop or switch statement it is contained within. However, the initial state does not specify any loop or switch statement, so the `break` statement would have no effect on the variables in this context.

Since there are no changes to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is the smallest integer such that 2, and the current value of `i` is 0.**
