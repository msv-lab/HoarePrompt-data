Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly generate an array with exactly X increasing subsequences for all values of X. Specifically, the program attempts to decompose X into a sum of powers of 2 and then constructs an array based on these powers. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly X increasing subsequences, especially for larger values of X.

Here are a few issues with the program:
1. The logic for constructing the array does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly X.
2. The program does not handle all cases correctly, especially when X is not a power of 2 or a sum of distinct powers of 2.
3. The program does not account for the specific requirement of having exactly X increasing subsequences, which can be complex for large values of X.

For example, the program fails to generate a correct array for X = 37. The expected output for X = 37 is an array of length 7 with specific values that result in exactly 37 increasing subsequences, but the program does not provide such an array.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using combinatorial techniques to construct the array based on the binary representation of X and ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches X exactly.
