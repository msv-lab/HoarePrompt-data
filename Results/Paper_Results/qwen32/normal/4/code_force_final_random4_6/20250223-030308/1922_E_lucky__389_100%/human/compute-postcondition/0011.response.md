The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `X`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an integer and `x` must be at least 2; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is 0; `i` is 1.**
