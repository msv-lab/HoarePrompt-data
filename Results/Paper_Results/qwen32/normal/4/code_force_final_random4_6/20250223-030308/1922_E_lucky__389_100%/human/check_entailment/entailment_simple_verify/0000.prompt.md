You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly generate an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all possible values of `X` within the given range (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). There are several issues with the code:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not handle the case when `X` is not a sum of powers of 2 correctly. The approach of subtracting the largest power of 2 from `X` repeatedly is not guaranteed to produce the correct array for all values of `X`.

2. **Constructing the Array**: The way the array is constructed from the list of subsequence lengths (`subseq_lens`) does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`. The logic for appending elements to `ansv` is flawed and does not guarantee the required number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Output Format**: The output format might not always be correct, especially when the constructed array does not meet the criteria of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

To illustrate the problem, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
0 1
```

**Actual Output from the Provided Code:**
```
1
0
```

The provided code fails to generate an array with exactly 3 increasing subsequences for `X = 3`. The correct array should be `[0, 1]`, which has the following increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, and `[0, 1]`.

Therefore, the code is incorrect for at least one input case, and hence the correctness is `False`.
