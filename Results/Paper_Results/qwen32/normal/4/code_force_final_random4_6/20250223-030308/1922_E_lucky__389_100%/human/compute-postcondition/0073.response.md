Let's analyze the given task step by step.

### Initial State:
- The elements of `ansv` are to be printed in order, each followed by a space.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print()
```

### Analysis:
The `print()` function in Python, when called without any arguments, outputs a newline character (`\n`). It does not print any of the elements of `ansv` because they are not specified as arguments to the `print()` function.

### Output:
Since the `print()` function is called without any arguments, it will simply print a newline.

Output: **(newline)**

To format it strictly according to the given instructions:

Output: **\n**
