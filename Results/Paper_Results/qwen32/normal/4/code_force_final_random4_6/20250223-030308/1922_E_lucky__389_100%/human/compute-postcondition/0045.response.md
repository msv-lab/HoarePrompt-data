The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The precondition that `x` must be at least 2 remains unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is already increased by 1, this means `i` is effectively increased by 2 from its original value. The variable `x` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 2, and `x` must be at least 2.**
