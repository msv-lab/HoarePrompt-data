Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is 0; `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of all subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to the original `X` and must have at least 4 elements; `mx` is the maximum length of these subsequences; `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx-1` and also includes `subseq_lens[2]` and `subseq_lens[3]`; `i` is 3**.

The value of `ansv` has been updated to include `subseq_lens[3]`, which is the fourth element of the `subseq_lens` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
