To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop head. The loop will continue to execute as long as `2 ** i <= x` holds true.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is increased by 2.
- `x` must be at least 2.

Let's analyze the loop condition `2 ** i <= x`:
- `i` is increased by 2 in each iteration, so for the loop to execute again, `2 ** (i + 2)` must be less than or equal to `x`.
- Since `i` is increased by 2, we need to ensure that the new value of `i` (which is `i + 2`) still satisfies the condition with `x`.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i_prev + 2`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
- We need `2 ** (i_prev + 2) <= x`.

Given that `x` must be at least 2, we need to adjust `x` to be at least `2 ** (i_prev + 2)`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `x` is at least `2 ** (i_prev + 2)`.

State: **`i` is increased by 2, and `x` must be at least `2 ** (i + 2)`**
