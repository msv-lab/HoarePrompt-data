To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that the condition `2 ** i <= x` is satisfied. Let's analyze the variables involved in the loop head:

- `i` is 0.
- `x` is any non-zero integer.

The loop condition `2 ** i <= x` translates to `2 ** 0 <= x`, which simplifies to `1 <= x`. Since `x` is described as any non-zero integer, it can be positive or negative. However, for the loop to execute, `x` must be a positive integer because `2 ** i` is always positive for any integer `i`.

Given that `x` is any non-zero integer, we need to ensure it is positive. Therefore, we need to adjust `x` to be a positive integer. The other variables (`t`, `X`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`) are not part of the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

**State:** **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is a positive integer; `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or a list containing `i - 1`; `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` or `i - 1`; `i` is 0**
