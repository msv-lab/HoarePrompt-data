To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop, which is `2 ** i <= x`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as \(2^i\) is less than or equal to \(x\).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- For each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.
- `x` is at least 4.
- `subseq_lens` is an empty list.
- `mx` is 0.
- `i` is 2.

We need to ensure that `2 ** i <= x` holds true for the next iteration of the loop. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, so we need to check if \(2^2 \leq x\). Since \(2^2 = 4\) and `x` is at least 4, the condition \(2^2 \leq x\) is satisfied.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that after the next iteration, `i` is incremented to 3, and \(2^3 \leq x\) still holds true. Therefore, `x` must be at least 8 (since \(2^3 = 8\)).

No other states need to be adjusted because the condition only depends on `i` and `x`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is at least 8; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is 0; `i` is 2**.
