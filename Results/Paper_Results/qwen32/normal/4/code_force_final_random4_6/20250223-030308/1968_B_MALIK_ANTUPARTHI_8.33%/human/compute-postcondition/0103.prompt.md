Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer; `b` is a binary string of length `m`; the sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `m` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    b, c = map(int, input().split())
    d = input()
    e = input()
    k = 0
    for j in range(b):
        if d[j] in e[k:]:
            k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
            if k == c or j == b - 1:
                k = j + 1
                break
        else:
            k = j
            break
    print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is the final value determined by the last iteration of the loop, `i` is `b + 1`, `a` is greater than `b + 1`, `b` is the first input integer, `c` is the second input integer, `d` is the third input string, and `e` is the fourth input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is `e.index(d[b - 1]) + 1`, `i` is `b + 2`, `a` is greater than `b + 2`, `b` is the first new input integer, `c` is the second new input integer, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the new input string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
