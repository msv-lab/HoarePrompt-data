a and b are binary strings (strings consisting of '0' and '1' only), n is the length of string a, m is the length of string b, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function is called multiple times (up to 10^4 times) with different values of a and b, but the total length of all strings a and b combined does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
