The code snippet `k = j` assigns the value of `j` to `k`. Given that `j` is `j + 1` in the initial state, it implies that `j` has been incremented by 1 before this assignment. Therefore, `k` will take the value of the incremented `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer; the sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `m` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `d` is an input string; `e` is the value of the user input; `j` is `j + 1`; `k` is `j + 1`.**
