The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only terminates the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the provided code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is `j + 1`, `i` is `b + 1`, `a` is greater than `b + 1`, `b` is greater than or equal to `1`, `c` is the second input integer, `d` is the third input string, and `e` is the fourth input string. `j` is `j + 1`.**
