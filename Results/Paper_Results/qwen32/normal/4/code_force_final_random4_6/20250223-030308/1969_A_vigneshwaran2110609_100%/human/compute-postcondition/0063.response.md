Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers. It checks if there exists an index `i` such that `p[p[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`. If such an index exists, it prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`. The function performs this check for each of the `t` test cases.**
