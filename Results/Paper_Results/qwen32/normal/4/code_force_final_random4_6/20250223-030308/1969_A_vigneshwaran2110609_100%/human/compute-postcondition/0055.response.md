The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. Therefore, only these variables can be adjusted to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `n` is the total number of iterations
- `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`, `flag` is set to `True` and the program breaks out of the loop; otherwise, `flag` remains `False`.

Since the loop is `for i in range(0, x)`, at the start of the next iteration, the value of `i` should be incremented by 1. The value of `x` remains unchanged.

State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the total number of iterations, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input**.
