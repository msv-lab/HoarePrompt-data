Given the task, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

State at the end of the previous iteration: The loop completes all `x` iterations without breaking. The program prints `3`.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the provided information, we know that the loop has completed all `x` iterations, which means `i` has taken on every value from `0` to `n-1`. Since the loop has completed all iterations, `i` at the end of the last iteration would be `n-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented to `n`, and the condition `i < n` would need to be true. However, since the loop has already completed all iterations, `i` being `n` would mean the loop condition `i < n` is no longer satisfied, and thus the loop would not execute again.

Given that the loop has completed all iterations, the only way to have the loop execute one more time would be to adjust `n` such that `i` can be incremented to a value less than the new `n`. However, since the problem states that the loop has completed all `x` iterations without breaking, the logical conclusion is that `i` is `n-1` and `n` is the total number of iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the loop cannot be adjusted to have the loop execute one more time since the loop has already completed all iterations. However, if we were to consider the state right before the loop ends, it would be:

State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is the total number of iterations**.

Since the task requires us to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, and given that the loop has already completed, we can infer that the state provided is the final state, and no further adjustments can make the loop execute again.

Thus, the state as it is right before the loop ends (and cannot execute one more time) is:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is the total number of iterations**.

However, if we strictly follow the requirement to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we can say that such a state does not exist given the loop has already completed all iterations. The closest logical state before the loop ends is:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is the total number of iterations**.
