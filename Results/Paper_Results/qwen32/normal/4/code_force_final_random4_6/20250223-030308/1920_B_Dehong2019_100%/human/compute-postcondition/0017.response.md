The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of the element at index `i + x` in the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
- `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a` from the `x-th` element to the end of the list plus `a[0]`.
- `i` is 0.
- `ans2` is equal to the sum of the elements in `a` from the `x-th` element to the end of the list.
- `i + x` is less than `n`.

After executing the code snippet:
- The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from it.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a` from the `x-th` element to the end of the list plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`; `i` is 0; `ans2` is equal to the sum of the elements in `a` from the `x-th` element to the end of the list.**
