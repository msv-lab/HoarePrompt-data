You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

    2 2 1
    
    4 3
    
    2 1 2
    
    1 3

Output

    0
    2
    0
    3
    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for handling the removal of elements by Alice and the flipping of elements by Bob is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Handling Alice's Removal**: The code does not correctly handle the removal of elements by Alice. It only considers removing the largest elements, but it does not account for the possibility that removing smaller elements might allow Bob to flip more elements to minimize the sum.

2. **Handling Bob's Flipping**: The code assumes that Bob will always flip the largest remaining elements. However, Bob's optimal strategy might involve flipping smaller elements to minimize the sum, especially if removing elements by Alice changes the optimal elements to flip.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Sum**: The code calculates the sum by only considering the first `x` elements for flipping and the first `k` elements for removal, but it does not correctly account for the interaction between these two operations.

Let's consider a specific test case to illustrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5 2 2
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-15
```

**Explanation:**
- Alice should remove the two smallest elements `-4` and `-5`, leaving `[-1, -2, -3]`.
- Bob should then flip the two smallest elements `-1` and `-2`, resulting in `[1, 2, -3]`.
- The final sum is `1 + 2 - 3 = 0`.

However, the provided code will likely not produce the correct result for this test case because it does not correctly handle the interaction between Alice's removal and Bob's flipping.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
