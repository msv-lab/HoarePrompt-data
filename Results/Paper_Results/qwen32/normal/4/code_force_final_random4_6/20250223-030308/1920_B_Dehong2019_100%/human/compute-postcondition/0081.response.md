The code snippet provided is `ans1 += a[i]`. This means that the current value of `ans1` will be updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to it.

Initial State:
- `t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input with `x` greater than 0.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
- `i` is `x` (since `i` was `x - 1` and we increment it by 1).
- `ans2` is `max(ans1, ans2)`.
- `k` is greater than 0.
- If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[x-1]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` is not updated.

After executing `ans1 += a[i]`, the value of `ans1` will be increased by `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input with `x` greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x`; `ans1` is the previous value of `ans1` plus `a[i]`; `ans2` is `max(ans1, ans2)`; `k` is greater than 0. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then the previous `ans1` was the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[x-1]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` was not updated before the increment.**
