The code snippet subtracts `a[i] * 2` from `ans1`. Given that `i` is `x - 1`, and `ans1` was initially the sum of the list `a` minus `4 * a[i]`, after the subtraction, `ans1` becomes the sum of the list `a` minus `6 * a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input with `x` must be greater than 0; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x - 1`; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus `6 * a[i]`; `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` across all iterations**.
