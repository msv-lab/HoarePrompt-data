The code snippet provided is `print(n - 1)`, and based on the initial state, `n` is an integer obtained from the input, and `k` is another integer obtained from the input that is less than `n - 1`. 

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can only express the output in terms of `n`. The expression `n - 1` will be evaluated and printed.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `n` is an integer input, and its exact value is not specified.
2. `k` is an integer input, and it is known that `k < n - 1`. However, the value of `k` is not required to determine the output of the `print(n - 1)` statement.
3. The `print(n - 1)` statement will output the result of the expression `n - 1`.

Therefore, the output will be `n - 1`, where `n` is the first integer obtained from the input.

Output: **n - 1 (where n is the first integer obtained from the input)**
