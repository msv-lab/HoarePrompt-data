Let's break down the given information and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

Initial State:
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore this detail for the output).
- `t` remains the same (similarly, `t` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore this detail for the output).
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.

The code snippet:
```python
print(n - 1)
```

Explanation:
- The print statement will output the result of the expression `n - 1`.
- `n` is the first integer from the input, so we need to represent the output in terms of `n`.

Based on the given information, we can conclude that the output will be `n - 1`.

Output: **n - 1 (where n is the first integer from the input)**
