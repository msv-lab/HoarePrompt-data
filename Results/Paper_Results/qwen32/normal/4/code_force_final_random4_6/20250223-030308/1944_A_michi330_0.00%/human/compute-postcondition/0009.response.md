The code snippet assigns the values of `n` and `k` based on the input provided, which is split into two integers. The initial state indicates that `i` has been incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by the initial state and are determined by the input.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its current value, and `i` must be less than `t`; `n` and `k` are the two integers provided as input.**
