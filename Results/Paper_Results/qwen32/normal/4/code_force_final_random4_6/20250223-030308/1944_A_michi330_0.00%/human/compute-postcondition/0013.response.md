The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value, and `i` must be less than `t`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value, we need to adjust `i` to be one more than its previous value. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged and do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its current value, `t` remains the same, `n` and `k` remain unchanged**. Assuming the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is `x`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

To put this into the required format:

State: **`i` is one more than its current value, `t` remains the same, `n` and `k` remain unchanged**. If the current value of `i` is `x`, then `i` is now `x + 1`.

Since we don't have the exact current value of `i`:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `n` and `k` remain unchanged**.
