### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to `k` bridges in a fully connected graph of `n` islands.

The key insight is that in a fully connected graph with `n` islands, there are `n-1` bridges that, if destroyed, would isolate island 1 from the rest of the islands. If Dominater destroys fewer than `n-1` bridges, there will always be a path from island 1 to every other island, because there are multiple redundant paths available. Therefore, Everule can still visit all `n` islands.

However, if Dominater destroys `n-1` or more bridges, it is possible to isolate island 1 from the rest of the islands, meaning Everule can only visit island 1.

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
- If `k >= n - 1`, it prints `1` (Everule can only visit island 1).
- Otherwise, it prints `n` (Everule can visit all `n` islands).

This matches the problem's requirements and the given examples.
