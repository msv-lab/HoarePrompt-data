The code snippet `A.sort()` sorts the list `A` in ascending order. The values of `t` and `n` are not affected by this operation, and `a` remains unchanged as well. The list `A` will now contain the same integers but in a sorted sequence.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 4999, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7, `A` is a sorted list of integers provided by the new input.**
