Reasoning:
The problem requires us to maximize our score by performing n moves, where each move consists of selecting two integers from the list, adding the smaller one to the score, and removing both integers from the list. The strategy to maximize the score is to always pair the smallest available numbers together because this way, we add the smallest possible number to the score in each move, thereby maximizing the overall score.

The provided program follows this strategy correctly:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
4. It calculates the score by summing every second element from the sorted list (which are the smallest elements in each pair).
5. It prints the score for each test case.

This approach ensures that we are always adding the smallest possible number to the score in each move, leading to the maximum possible score.

Correctness: **True**
