In this task, we need to ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once. The loop condition is `while t:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `t` is a non-zero value.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7.

The variable `t` is the only one involved in the loop condition. Since `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, it is guaranteed to be a non-zero value. Therefore, the loop can certainly execute at least once without any modifications.

Thus, the state right before the loop does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7**
