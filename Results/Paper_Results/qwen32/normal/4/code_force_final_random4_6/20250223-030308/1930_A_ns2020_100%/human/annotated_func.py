#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        A.sort()
        
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State: `t` is 0, no further input is processed, and the loop terminates.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list and prints the sum of the integers at even indices (0-based).
