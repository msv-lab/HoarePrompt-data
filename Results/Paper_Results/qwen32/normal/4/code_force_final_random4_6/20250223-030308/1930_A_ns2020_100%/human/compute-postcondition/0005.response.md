To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the provided code. Here's the breakdown:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `a` is a list of \(2n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
- `A` is a sorted list of integers.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `A[::2]`**: The slice notation `A[::2]` refers to every second element in the list `A` starting from the first element (index 0). Therefore, `A[::2]` will be a list containing elements at indices 0, 2, 4, 6, ..., up to the largest even index that is within the bounds of `A`.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The `sum(A[::2])` computes the sum of the elements in the list `A[::2]`.

3. **Sorted List `A`**: Since `A` is a sorted list, the elements in `A[::2]` are the sorted elements at even indices of `A`.

### Output:
The output will be the sum of the elements at even indices of the sorted list `A`.

Since the exact elements of `A` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the sum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum of the elements at even indices of `A`.

### Final Output:
Output: **sum of elements at even indices of the sorted list `A`**
