Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7, `A` is a sorted list of integers provided by the new input.**

In simpler terms, the value of `t` has been decreased by 1, while `n`, `a`, and `A` remain unchanged.
