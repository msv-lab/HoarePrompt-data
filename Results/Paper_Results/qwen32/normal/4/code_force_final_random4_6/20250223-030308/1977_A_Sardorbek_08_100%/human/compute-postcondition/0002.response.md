The code snippet assigns the values from `input().split()` to the variables `b` and `c`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` have certain constraints and values. After executing the code, `b` and `c` will have the values provided by the input, and the other variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` must be greater than or equal to 1, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input.**
