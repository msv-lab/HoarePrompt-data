The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q`), but none of these variables are directly used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables and will always output the string `'Yes'`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
2. The variables `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100.
3. The variable `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
4. The variables `b` and `c` are integers where `b` is the first integer from the input and `c` is the second integer from the input.
5. The variable `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.
6. The conditions described (whether `b` equals `c` or not, and their parities) do not affect the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the variables' values, the output will always be `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
