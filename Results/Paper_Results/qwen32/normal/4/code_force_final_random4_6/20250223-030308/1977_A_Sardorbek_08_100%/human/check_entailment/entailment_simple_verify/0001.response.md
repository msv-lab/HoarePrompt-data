### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly 1 cube.
- The key observations are:
  1. If `n == m`, it's possible by adding 1 cube in each move.
  2. If `n < m`, it's impossible because we cannot add more cubes than the number of moves.
  3. If `n > m`, the number of cubes `m` must have the same parity as `n` (both odd or both even) because the parity alternates with each move.

#### Program Analysis:
The program follows these conditions:
1. **First Condition**: `if b == c: print('YES')`
   - This correctly handles the scenario where the number of moves `n` is equal to the number of cubes `m`.
2. **Second Condition**: `elif b < c: print('NO')`
   - This correctly handles the scenario where the number of moves `n` is less than the number of cubes `m`.
3. **Third Condition**: `elif b % 2 == c % 2: print('Yes')`
   - This correctly handles the scenario where the number of moves `n` is greater than the number of cubes `m` and they have the same parity.
4. **Else Condition**: `else: print('No')`
   - This correctly handles the scenario where the number of moves `n` is greater than the number of cubes `m` and they have different parity.

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes each test case and checks the conditions as described:
- `b` and `c` are correctly read from the input.
- The program checks the conditions in the correct order and prints the appropriate result.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic derived from the problem statement. It handles all possible cases and provides the correct output for each scenario.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
