Let's analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem description and the function summary to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap

Nikita can build a tower by either adding or removing one cube at a time. Given `n` moves, we need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower. The key points are:
- If `n == m`, it's possible by adding one cube in each move.
- If `n < m`, it's impossible because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
- If `n > m`, the parity (odd or even) of `m` must match the parity of `n` because the parity of the number of cubes alternates with each move.

### Program Analysis

Here is the provided program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line is redundant and can be removed
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Function Summary Recap

The function summary states:
- The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`.
- It prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`.
- It prints 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`.
- It prints 'Yes' if `b` and `c` have the same parity.
- It prints 'No' otherwise.

### Evaluation Against Problem Description

1. **First Condition**: `if b == c: print('YES')`
   - This correctly checks if `n == m` and prints "YES" if true.
   
2. **Second Condition**: `elif b < c: print('NO')`
   - This correctly checks if `n < m` and prints "NO" if true.
   
3. **Third Condition**: `elif b % 2 == c % 2: print('Yes')`
   - This correctly checks if `n` and `m` have the same parity and prints "YES" if true.
   
4. **Else Condition**: `else: print('No')`
   - This correctly handles the case where `n > m` and `n` and `m` have different parity, printing "NO".

### Case Insensitivity

The problem description specifies that the output can be in any case (lowercase or uppercase). The program prints "YES" and "NO" in uppercase and "Yes" and "No" in title case. This is acceptable based on the problem description.

### Redundant Code

The line `q = (b, c)` is redundant and can be removed without affecting the functionality of the program.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic based on the problem description and handles all possible cases. The output format is also acceptable as per the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct.
