Let's analyze the given Python program in the context of the problem statement and the annotated states provided.

### Problem Analysis:
Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube in each move. Given `n` moves and the goal of ending up with `m` cubes, the problem can be solved by considering the parity (evenness or oddness) of `n` and `m`:

1. **If `n == m`:** It is trivially possible to end up with `m` cubes in `n` moves by simply adding one cube per move.
2. **If `n < m`:** It is impossible to end up with `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes that can be added in `n` moves is `n`, which is less than `m`.
3. **If `n > m`:** The key observation here is that the parity of the number of cubes (`m`) can only be changed by an odd number of moves. Therefore, if `n` is odd, it is possible to end up with `m` cubes if `m` is reachable by the sequence of operations, and if `n` is even, `m` must have the same parity as `n` to be reachable (since an even number of additions/removals will not change the parity).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `a` and then for each test case, it reads `b` (number of moves) and `c` (desired number of cubes). It then checks:

- If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'.
- If `b < c`, it prints 'NO'.
- If `b` and `c` have the same parity (`b % 2 == c % 2`), it prints 'YES'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The logic in the program is almost correct, but there is a small mistake in the print statements. The problem statement says that the output can be in any case (lowercase or uppercase), but the program inconsistently uses 'YES' and 'No' (or 'NO' and 'yes'). To match the problem statement, the output should be consistent in case, either all uppercase or all lowercase.

However, the core logic of the program is correct and it correctly determines if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the parity and the conditions mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
Despite the case inconsistency in the output, the logic of the program is correct. If we assume that the case inconsistency does not affect the correctness of the solution (since the problem statement allows for any case), we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
