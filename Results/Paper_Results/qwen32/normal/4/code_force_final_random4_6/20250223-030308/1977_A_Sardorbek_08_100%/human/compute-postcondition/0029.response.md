Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` and `c` are the new integers from the input, `q` is the tuple `(b, c)` after the input, and `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**

In natural language: The value of `q` is updated to the new tuple `(b, c)` formed from the input values. All other variables retain their previous values.
