The `print('No')` statement is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q` are described in the initial state, but they do not influence the output of this particular print statement. The print statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Output: **No**
