You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`. It then prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, 'Yes' if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

Nikita can perform two types of moves:
1. Add 1 cube to the tower.
2. Remove 1 cube from the tower.

The goal is to determine if, after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.

### Key Observations:
1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Possible Moves**: Each move either adds or removes 1 cube.
3. **Parity**: The parity (odd or even nature) of the number of cubes in the tower will alternate with each move. Starting from 0 (even), after an odd number of moves, the number of cubes will be odd, and after an even number of moves, the number of cubes will be even.

### Conditions to Determine the Possibility:
1. **Equal Moves and Cubes**: If `n == m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves by adding 1 cube in each move.
2. **More Moves than Cubes**: If `n < m`, it's impossible because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves.
3. **Parity Check**: If `n > m`, the number of cubes `m` must have the same parity as `n` (both odd or both even) because the parity alternates with each move.

### Program Analysis

Let's compare the logic in the provided program with the conditions we derived:

1. **First Condition**: `if b == c: print('YES')`
   - This checks if `n == m`. If true, it correctly prints "YES".
   
2. **Second Condition**: `elif b < c: print('NO')`
   - This checks if `n < m`. If true, it correctly prints "NO".
   
3. **Third Condition**: `elif b % 2 == c % 2: print('Yes')`
   - This checks if `n` and `m` have the same parity. If true, it correctly prints "YES".
   
4. **Else Condition**: `else: print('No')`
   - This handles the remaining cases, which are when `n > m` and `n` and `m` have different parity. It correctly prints "NO".

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic based on the conditions derived from the problem statement. It handles all possible cases and provides the correct output for each scenario.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
