The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the loop iterates over the range of `a`. Therefore, the state of `a` determines whether the loop will execute. If `a` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` are given, but only `a` can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes:
- `a` must be greater than or equal to 1.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`) do not affect the execution of the loop based on the provided loop statement and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` must be greater than or equal to 1**
