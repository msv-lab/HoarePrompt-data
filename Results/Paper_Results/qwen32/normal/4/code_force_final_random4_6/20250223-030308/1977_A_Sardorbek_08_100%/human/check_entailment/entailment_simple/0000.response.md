Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to determine if it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube. The logic in the program is flawed, and it doesn't correctly determine the possibility based on the given conditions.

Here's the breakdown of the issues:
1. **Condition `if b == c:`**: If `n` (b) equals `m` (c), the program prints 'YES'. While this is correct for the case where `n` equals `m`, it doesn't account for the possibility of achieving `m` cubes when `n` is not equal to `m`.
2. **Condition `elif b < c:`**: If `n` (b) is less than `m` (c), the program prints 'NO'. This is incorrect because it's possible to have `m` cubes if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, as adding and removing cubes can balance out to end up with `m` cubes.
3. **Condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2:`**: If `n` (b) and `m` (c) have the same parity (both even or both odd), the program prints 'Yes'. This is correct because to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be even, allowing for an equal number of addition and removal operations.
4. **Condition `else:`**: If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'No'. This is incorrect for cases where `n` is greater than `m` and `n - m` is even, which should result in 'Yes'.

The correct logic should be:
- If `n - m` is even and non-negative, print 'Yes'.
- Otherwise, print 'No'.

Since the program does not correctly implement this logic, it will not always produce the correct output.

Correctness: **False**
