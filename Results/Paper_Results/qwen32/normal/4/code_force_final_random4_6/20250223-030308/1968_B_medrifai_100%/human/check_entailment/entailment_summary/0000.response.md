### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to find the maximum length of a prefix of string `a` that can be found as a subsequence in string `b`. The program iterates over the characters of `a` and `b` using two pointers, `i` and `j`, where `i` tracks the current character in `a` and `j` tracks the current character in `b`. The helper function `func_1` is used to find the next occurrence of the character `a[i]` in `b` starting from position `j`.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `i` and `j` to 0, and `c` to 0. `i` and `j` are used to traverse `a` and `b` respectively, and `c` counts the number of characters in `a` that form a subsequence in `b`.

2. **Loop**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `a` and `j` is less than the length of `b`.
   - **func_1 Call**: For each character `a[i]`, `func_1` is called to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in `b` starting from position `j`.
   - **Update Pointers**: If `func_1` returns a valid index (`new_j`), it means `a[i]` was found in `b` starting from `j`, so `j` is updated to `new_j + 1` (to move past the found character), `i` is incremented to move to the next character in `a`, and `c` is incremented to count the found character.
   - **Break Condition**: If `func_1` returns -1, it means `a[i]` is not found in `b` starting from `j`, so the loop breaks.

3. **Output**: After the loop, the value of `c` is printed, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` correctly finds the next occurrence of `a[i]` in `b` starting from position `j` using the `find` method. If the character is found, it returns the correct index; otherwise, it returns -1.
- **Logic of the Loop**: The loop correctly updates the pointers `i` and `j` based on the result of `func_1`. If a character from `a` is found in `b`, it moves to the next character in `a` and updates the position in `b` to continue searching from the next character. If a character is not found, the loop breaks, and the current count `c` is the correct result.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of a prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` for each test case.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
