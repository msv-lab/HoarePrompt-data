You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of integers of length n where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of a_i is divisible by n.
def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if (total_water % n != 0) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, and `total_water % n` is equal to 0.
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
        
    #State: container is 0.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function checks if it's possible to redistribute the water in the containers such that each container has the same amount of water, given that the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. It returns 'Yes' if redistribution is possible without any container having a negative amount of water at any point during the process; otherwise, it returns 'No'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues and does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's go through the code and identify the problems:

1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**: The program reads the entire input at once and tries to parse it, but it does not correctly separate the different test cases. The variable `n` is set to the total number of test cases, and `a` is set to the entire list of water amounts across all test cases. This is incorrect because each test case has its own `n` and `a`.

2. **Function Call Before Definition**: The function `func_1` is called before it is defined. This will result in a `NameError`.

3. **Logic Error**: The logic in `func_1` is incorrect. The function checks if the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target is negative, which is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to equalize the water levels. It does not correctly simulate the operation of pouring water from one container to another.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1

results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        results.append('No')
    else:
        target = total_water // n
        container = 0
        possible = True
        for water in a:
            container += water - target
            if container < 0:
                possible = False
                break
        results.append('Yes' if possible else 'No')

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

In this corrected version:
- The program correctly reads and processes each test case separately.
- The function `func_1` is replaced with inline logic.
- The logic checks if the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target is negative, which correctly determines if it's possible to equalize the water levels.

Since the original program does not handle the input parsing and logic correctly, it is incorrect.
