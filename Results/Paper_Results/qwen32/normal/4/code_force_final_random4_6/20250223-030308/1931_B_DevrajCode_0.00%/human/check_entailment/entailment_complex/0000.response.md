### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to determine if it's possible to redistribute the water in the containers such that each container has the same amount of water, given the constraints and operations described in the problem.

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program first calculates the total amount of water across all containers.
   - It then checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If not, it immediately returns 'No'. However, the problem guarantees that this condition is always true, so this check is redundant but does not affect correctness.

2. **Redistribution Logic:**
   - The program calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is the total water divided by the number of containers.
   - It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a running balance (`container`) that tracks the excess or deficit of water compared to the target.
   - If at any point the running balance (`container`) becomes negative, the program returns 'No'. This indicates that there is not enough water in the previous containers to balance out the deficit in the current container, making it impossible to redistribute the water evenly.
   - If the loop completes without the balance going negative, it means it is possible to redistribute the water evenly, and the program returns 'Yes'.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases with a single container correctly, as the total water will always be equal to the target water for that container.
   - It also handles cases where all containers already have the same amount of water, as the running balance will remain zero throughout the loop.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the water can be redistributed evenly among the containers. It efficiently checks the necessary conditions and handles all edge cases as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
