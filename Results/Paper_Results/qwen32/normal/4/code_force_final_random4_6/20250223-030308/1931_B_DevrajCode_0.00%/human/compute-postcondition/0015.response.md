The only object in the loop head is the variable `water`. Therefore, we need to adjust `water` to be the next element in the list `a` for the next iteration of the loop. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, and `container`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted here.

At the end of the previous iteration, `water` was the current element being processed from the list `a`. For the next iteration, `water` should be the next element in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `total_water % n` is equal to 0, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is updated by adding `(water - target)`, `water` is the next element in the list `a`. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, the program continues without returning 'No'.**
