The only object in the loop head is the variable `water`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`. The other variables `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, and `container` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted based on the loop's iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `water` has taken the value of one of the elements in the list `a`. To execute the loop one more time, `water` must take the value of the next element in the list `a`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `water` had the value of the current element in the list `a`.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `water` must take the value of the next element in the list `a`.

Since we don't know the specific position of `water` in the list `a` at the end of the previous iteration, we can only generalize that `water` will take the value of the next element in the list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `total_water % n` is equal to 0, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is `water - target`, and `container` is greater than or equal to 0, `water` is the next element in the list `a`**. 

Since we don't have the specific index, we can't specify the exact value of `water`, but we know it will be the next element in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `total_water % n` is equal to 0, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is `water - target`, and `container` is greater than or equal to 0, `water` is the next element in the list `a`**.
