Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `total_water % n` is equal to 0, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is updated by adding `(water - target)`, `water` is the next element in the list `a`. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, the program continues without returning 'No'.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block is executed, considering the condition and the actions taken in both the if and else parts.
