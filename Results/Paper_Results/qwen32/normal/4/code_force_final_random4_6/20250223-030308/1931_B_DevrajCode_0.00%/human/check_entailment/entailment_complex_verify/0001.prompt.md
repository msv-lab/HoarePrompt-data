You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:

- Annotated Code: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of integers of length n where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of a_i is divisible by n.
def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if (total_water % n != 0) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, and `total_water % n` is equal to 0.
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
        
    #State: container is 0.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function checks if it's possible to redistribute the water in the containers such that each container has the same amount of water, given that the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. It returns 'Yes' if redistribution is possible without any container having a negative amount of water at any point during the process; otherwise, it returns 'No'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
- We have `n` containers, each with an initial amount of water `a_i`.
- The total amount of water is divisible by `n`, meaning the average amount of water per container is an integer.
- We need to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from one container to another, with the constraint that water can only be poured from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.

### Key Insight:
- For the operation to be valid, the amount of water in any container `i` should not be less than the target amount of water (which is the total water divided by `n`) at any point during the process of pouring water.
- If at any point, the cumulative excess (or deficit) of water in the containers from the first to the current one is negative, it means we cannot pour enough water from the previous containers to make up for the deficit in the current one, and hence, it is impossible to equalize the water.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element is the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of initial water amounts `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
   - It first calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. However, the problem guarantees that the total water is divisible by `n` for each test case, so this check is redundant.
   - It calculates the target amount of water per container (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a running total of the excess (or deficit) water (`container`).
   - If at any point the running total of excess water becomes negative, it returns "No", indicating that it is impossible to equalize the water.
   - If the loop completes without the running total becoming negative, it returns "Yes".

### Correctness:
- The logic of the program correctly reflects the problem's requirements.
- The program ensures that at no point does the cumulative deficit of water exceed the excess water that can be poured from the previous containers.
- The program handles the constraints and examples provided correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and examples.

Correctness: **True**
