### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
- We have `n` containers, each with an initial amount of water `a_i`.
- The total amount of water is divisible by `n`, meaning the average amount of water per container is an integer.
- We need to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from one container to another, with the constraint that water can only be poured from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.

### Key Insight:
- For the operation to be valid, the amount of water in any container `i` should not be less than the target amount of water (which is the total water divided by `n`) at any point during the process of pouring water.
- If at any point, the cumulative excess (or deficit) of water in the containers from the first to the current one is negative, it means we cannot pour enough water from the previous containers to make up for the deficit in the current one, and hence, it is impossible to equalize the water.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element is the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of initial water amounts `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
   - It first calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. However, the problem guarantees that the total water is divisible by `n` for each test case, so this check is redundant.
   - It calculates the target amount of water per container (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a running total of the excess (or deficit) water (`container`).
   - If at any point the running total of excess water becomes negative, it returns "No", indicating that it is impossible to equalize the water.
   - If the loop completes without the running total becoming negative, it returns "Yes".

### Correctness:
- The logic of the program correctly reflects the problem's requirements.
- The program ensures that at no point does the cumulative deficit of water exceed the excess water that can be poured from the previous containers.
- The program handles the constraints and examples provided correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and examples.

Correctness: **True**
