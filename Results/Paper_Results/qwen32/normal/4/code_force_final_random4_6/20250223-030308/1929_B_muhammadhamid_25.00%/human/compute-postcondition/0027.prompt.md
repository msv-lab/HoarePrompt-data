Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k such that 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k == 1:
        print(1)
        continue
    if k <= 2 * n:
        print(math.ceil(k / 2))
    else:
        print(k // 2 + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. If `k` is 1, its value remains 1. Otherwise, the value of `k` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `k` is less than or equal to 2 times `n`, then `k` satisfies `k <= 2 * n`. If `k` is greater than 2 times `n`, then `k` satisfies `k > 2 * n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, and the next input value must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time. If `k` is equal to 1, the conditions remain as stated in the precondition. Otherwise, no changes are made to `n` or `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 times `n`, the conditions remain as stated in the if part. Otherwise, the conditions remain as stated in the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the first input integer, and `k` is the second input integer. No changes are made to `n` or `k` regardless of the condition `k <= 2 * n` because there is no else part to handle other cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
