To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `k` is the second input integer.
- If `k` is equal to 1, no changes are made to `n` or `k`.
- If `k` is not equal to 1, no changes are made to `n` or `k` either (since there is no else part to handle other cases).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The expression inside the `print` statement is `k // 2 + 1`.
- `k // 2` is an integer division, which means it will return the largest whole number less than or equal to the division result.
- Adding 1 to the result of `k // 2` will give us the final output.

### Output Calculation:
- If `k` is 1:
  - `k // 2` is `1 // 2`, which equals 0.
  - `0 + 1` equals 1.
  - Output: **1**
- If `k` is 2:
  - `k // 2` is `2 // 2`, which equals 1.
  - `1 + 1` equals 2.
  - Output: **2**
- If `k` is 3:
  - `k // 2` is `3 // 2`, which equals 1.
  - `1 + 1` equals 2.
  - Output: **2**
- If `k` is 4:
  - `k // 2` is `4 // 2`, which equals 2.
  - `2 + 1` equals 3.
  - Output: **3**
- And so on...

### Generalized Output:
The output of the print statement is `k // 2 + 1`, which depends on the value of `k`. Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the second input integer)**
