To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem and the program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

We need to color the minimum number of cells in an `n x n` grid such that at least `k` diagonals contain at least one colored cell. The grid has `4n - 2` diagonals in total (both main and anti-diagonals).

### Key Observations

1. **Diagonals in an `n x n` Grid:**
   - There are `2n - 1` diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right (main diagonals).
   - There are `2n - 1` diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left (anti-diagonals).
   - Total diagonals = `4n - 2`.

2. **Minimum Cells to Color:**
   - If `k <= 2n`, we can color cells such that we cover `k` diagonals with the minimum number of cells. This is because we can color cells in a way that each cell can cover two diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal) if possible.
   - If `k > 2n`, we need to color more cells because we can't cover all required diagonals by coloring cells that cover two diagonals each. In this case, we need to color additional cells to ensure all diagonals are covered.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program:

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
```

#### Case Analysis

1. **`k == 1`:**
   - The program correctly outputs `1` because only one cell is needed to cover one diagonal.

2. **`k <= 2n`:**
   - The program outputs `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is correct because each cell can cover at most two diagonals, so we need at least `ceil(k / 2)` cells to cover `k` diagonals.

3. **`k > 2n`:**
   - The program outputs `k // 2 + 1`. This is also correct because we can cover up to `2n` diagonals with `n` cells (each cell covering two diagonals), and for any additional diagonals beyond `2n`, we need to color additional cells. Each additional cell can cover at most one new diagonal, hence `k // 2 + 1`.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
