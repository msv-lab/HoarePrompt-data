The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, in this case, there is no loop present in the provided code snippet, so the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the program flow. Therefore, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer.**
