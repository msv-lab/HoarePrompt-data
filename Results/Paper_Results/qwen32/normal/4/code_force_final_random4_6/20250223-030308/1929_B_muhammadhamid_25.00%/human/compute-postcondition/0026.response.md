Postcondition: **`n` is the first input integer, and `k` is the second input integer. If `k` is equal to 1, no changes are made to `n` or `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 times `n`, no changes are made to `n` or `k`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `n` or `k` because there is no else part to handle other cases.**

However, the else part description seems to be redundant and identical to the if part and the precondition. Given the provided information, the else part does not provide any additional logic or changes. Therefore, the overall postcondition can be simplified to:

Postcondition: **`n` is the first input integer, and `k` is the second input integer. No changes are made to `n` or `k` regardless of the condition `k <= 2 * n` because there is no else part to handle other cases.**
