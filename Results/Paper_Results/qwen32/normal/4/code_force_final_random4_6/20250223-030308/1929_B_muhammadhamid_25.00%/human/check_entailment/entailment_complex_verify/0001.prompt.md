You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k such that 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        
    #State: The output state is a sequence of integers printed for each test case based on the conditions provided in the loop. Specifically, for each test case with integers `n` and `k`, the output is `1` if `k == 1`, `ceil(k / 2)` if `k <= 2 * n`, and `k // 2 + 1` if `k > 2 * n`. This sequence is printed after all `t` test cases have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer based on the values of `n` and `k`. The printed value is `1` if `k` is `1`, `ceil(k / 2)` if `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `k // 2 + 1` if `k` is greater than `2 * n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Grid and Diagonals**:
   - A square grid of size `n x n` has `4n - 2` diagonals.
   - The diagonals can be categorized into two types:
     - Main diagonals (including the main diagonal from top-left to bottom-right and the main diagonal from top-right to bottom-left).
     - Off-diagonals (diagonals parallel to the main diagonals).

2. **Objective**:
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - For `k` diagonals, we can strategically place colored cells to minimize the number of cells colored.
   - If `k` is small (specifically, `k <= 2n`), placing cells in alternating diagonals can cover the required number of diagonals efficiently.
   - If `k` is larger (specifically, `k > 2n`), we need to consider additional diagonals and might need to place more cells.

### Program Analysis:

The given program attempts to solve the problem as follows:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Handling Special Cases**:
   - If `k == 1`, it directly prints `1` because only one cell needs to be colored to cover one diagonal.

3. **General Case**:
   - If `k <= 2n`, it calculates the minimum number of cells to color using `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
   - If `k > 2n`, it calculates the minimum number of cells to color using `k // 2 + 1`.

### Evaluation:

Let's verify the logic for different scenarios:

- **For `k <= 2n`**:
  - The formula `math.ceil(k / 2)` correctly calculates the minimum number of cells needed to cover `k` diagonals by placing cells in alternating diagonals.
  - This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one off-diagonal or two off-diagonals).

- **For `k > 2n`**:
  - The formula `k // 2 + 1` is also correct.
  - When `k` exceeds `2n`, it means we need to cover more diagonals than just by placing cells in alternating diagonals. Hence, we need to place an additional cell to cover the remaining diagonals.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of cells needed to cover at least `k` diagonals in an `n x n` grid.
