The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state only specifies that `t` is an integer greater than 0, and this condition remains unchanged. The variables `n` and `k` are newly assigned values based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than 0; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.**
