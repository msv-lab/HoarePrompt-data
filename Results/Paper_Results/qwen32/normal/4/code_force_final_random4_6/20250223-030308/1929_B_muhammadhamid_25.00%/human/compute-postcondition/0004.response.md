The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the program flow.

Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; the current value of `k` is 1.**
