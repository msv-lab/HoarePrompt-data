To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `k` is greater than 2 times `n`.
- There is a conditional statement regarding `k`: If `k` is 1, then `k` is set to 1. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Value of `k`**:
   - According to the initial state, `k` is greater than 2 times `n`. This means `k > 2n`.
   - There is a conditional statement: if `k` is 1, then `k` is set to 1. However, since `k` is greater than 2 times `n` and `n` is at least 0 (as it's an integer), `k` cannot be 1. Therefore, this condition does not apply, and `k` remains as it was read from the input.

2. **Expression `k // 2 + 1`**:
   - `k // 2` performs integer division of `k` by 2, which means it divides `k` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest integer.
   - Adding 1 to the result of `k // 2` shifts the result up by one.

### Final Output:
The expression `k // 2 + 1` will be evaluated based on the value of `k`, which is greater than `2n`. Since we don't have the exact value of `k` or `n`, we can describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is an integer greater than 2n)**
