The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer based on the values of `n` and `k`. The printed value is `1` if `k` is `1`, `ceil(k / 2)` if `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `k // 2 + 1` if `k` is greater than `2 * n`.
