Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2. The function returns a value based on the relationship between `n` and `k` for each test case.**
