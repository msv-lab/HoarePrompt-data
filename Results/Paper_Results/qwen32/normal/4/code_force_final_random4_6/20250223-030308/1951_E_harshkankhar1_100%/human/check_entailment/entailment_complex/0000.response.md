### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to ensure the program meets the requirements:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function checks if the input string `s` is a palindrome by comparing `s` with its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - This function is correctly implemented for checking if a string is a palindrome.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function handles the main logic for each test case.
   - It reads a string `s` and its length `n`.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If it is not a palindrome, it prints `YES`, `1`, and the string `s` itself.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it then searches for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character. This is done using a loop that finds the index `x` of the first non-matching character.
   - If no such character is found (`x` remains `-1`), it prints `NO` because the string consists of the same character repeated, and thus, no non-palindromic partition is possible.
   - If a non-matching character is found, it checks if the substring starting from `x+1` is not a palindrome. If it is not, it prints `YES`, `2`, and the string partitioned into `s[:x+1]` and `s[x+1:]`.
   - If the substring `s[x+1:]` is a palindrome, it checks additional conditions:
     - If `x` is `1` or `x` is `n // 2`, it prints `NO` because no non-palindromic partition is possible.
     - Otherwise, it prints `YES`, `2`, and the string partitioned into `s[:x+2]` and `s[x+2:]`.

### Verification Against the Problem Description:

- **Case 1: Non-Palindromic String**:
  - If `s` is not a palindrome, the function immediately prints `YES`, `1`, and `s`. This is correct because the whole string itself is a valid non-palindromic partition.

- **Case 2: Palindromic String with All Identical Characters**:
  - If `s` is a palindrome consisting of the same character repeated, the function correctly prints `NO` because no non-palindromic partition is possible.

- **Case 3: Palindromic String with Different Characters**:
  - If `s` is a palindrome with different characters, the function finds the first differing character and checks the substring starting from that character. Depending on whether this substring is a palindrome, it prints `YES` with a valid partition or `NO` if no valid partition is possible.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly handles all the cases specified in the problem description. It checks for non-palindromic partitions and handles edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
