To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the information given in the initial state:

1. **`x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `s[0]`**:
   - This means `s[0]` is the first character of the string `s`, and `x` is the position of the first character in `s` that differs from `s[0]`.

2. **`x` is not equal to -1**:
   - This confirms that there is at least one character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`.

3. **`func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`**:
   - This indicates that the substring starting from the character after `s[x]` (i.e., `s[x + 1:]`) satisfies some condition defined in `func_1`.

4. **`x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`**:
   - Here, `n` is the length of the string `s`. This means that `x` is not the second character (index 1) and not the middle character (index `n // 2`).

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
```

- **`s[:x + 2]`**:
  - This is the substring of `s` from the beginning up to and including the character at index `x + 1`.
  - Since `x` is the index of the first character that is not equal to `s[0]`, `s[:x + 2]` will include `s[0]` and the first character that differs from `s[0]`, plus the character immediately following that differing character.

- **`s[x + 2:]`**:
  - This is the substring of `s` starting from the character at index `x + 2` to the end of the string.
  - It includes all characters after the two characters mentioned in the first part (`s[:x + 2]`).

Putting it all together, the `print` statement will output:
Output: **`s[0]` followed by the first character that is not `s[0]` and the character immediately following it, a space, and then the rest of the string starting from the character two positions after the first differing character**.

To format it precisely:
Output: **`s[:x + 2]` (which includes `s[0]`, the first character not equal to `s[0]`, and the character immediately following it), a space, and `s[x + 2:]` (the rest of the string starting from the character two positions after the first differing character)**.
