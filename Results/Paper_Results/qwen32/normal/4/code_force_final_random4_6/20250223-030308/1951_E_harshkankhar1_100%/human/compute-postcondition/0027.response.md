The given initial state provides information about the variable `x` and the function call `func_1(s[x + 1:])`. However, the specific details about the string `s` and the function `func_1` are not provided. Despite this, the print statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `x`, `s`, or the result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.

The print statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values or conditions described in the initial state.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **YES**
