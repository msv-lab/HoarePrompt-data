### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and verify if it correctly handles the requirements of the problem.

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function checks whether the given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Reading Input**: It reads a string `s` from the user.
   - **Initial Check**: It checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", followed by `1` (indicating one partition), and the string `s` itself (since the whole string is already a valid partition).
   - **Finding the First Different Character**: If the whole string is a palindrome, it searches for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character (`s[0]`). This index is stored in `x`.
     - If no such character is found (`x` remains `-1`), it prints "NO" because the string consists of the same character repeated, and thus, any partition will be a palindrome.
   - **Checking the Remaining Substring**: If a different character is found, it checks if the substring starting from this character (`s[x + 1:]`) is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", followed by `2` (indicating two partitions), and the two substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is `1` or `n // 2`. If `x` is `1` or `n // 2`, it prints "NO" because no valid partition can be found.
     - If `x` is neither `1` nor `n // 2`, it prints "YES", followed by `2` (indicating two partitions), and the two substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the case where the entire string is not a palindrome by outputting "YES" and the string itself.
- It correctly identifies strings consisting of the same character and outputs "NO" because such strings cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
- For strings where the first character differs from subsequent characters, the program attempts to partition the string into two parts, ensuring that the second part is not a palindrome.
- The logic for handling the case where `x` is `1` or `n // 2` is sound, as these positions make it impossible to create valid partitions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and provides valid partitions when possible.

**Correctness: True**
