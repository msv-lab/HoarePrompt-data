Let's analyze the given task step by step based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State:
- `x` is the index of the first character in the string `s` that is not equal to `s[0]`, and `x` is not equal to -1.
- `func_1(s[x + 1:])` evaluates to `False`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(2)
```

This statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state. The value `2` is explicitly provided to the `print` function.

### Output:
The code will print the integer `2` regardless of the values of `x`, `s`, or the result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **2**
