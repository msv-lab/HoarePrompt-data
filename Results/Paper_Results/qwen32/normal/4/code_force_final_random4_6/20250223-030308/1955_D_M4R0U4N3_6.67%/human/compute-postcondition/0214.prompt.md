Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is the second integer provided by the input and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer provided by the input and is greater than `m`; `k` is the third integer provided by the input; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the latest input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input with `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` removed if they were in `todo`; `done` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo`; `j` is `m-1`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of unique integers with `a[r]` removed if `a[r]` was in `todo`, except `old` is added back to `todo` if `old` was in `done`; `done` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `done`, and includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra`, and includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`; `j` is `m-1`; `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is not in `extra` anymore and is in `todo` if it was in `done`. If `old` was in `done`, it is not in `done` anymore and is in `todo`. Additionally, `a[r]` is not in `todo`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of unique integers with `a[r]` removed if `a[r]` was in `todo`, except `old` is added back to `todo` if `old` was in `done`; `done` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `done`, and includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo` or if `a[r]` was not in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra`, and includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`, and `old` is removed from `extra` if `old` was in `extra`; `j` is `m-1`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `a[r]` is not in `todo`; If `old` was in `extra`, it is not in `extra` anymore and is in `todo` if it was in `done`. If `old` was in `done`, it is not in `done` anymore and is in `todo`. Additionally, `a[r]` is not in `todo`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 2; `r` is `r + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of unique integers; `done` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` except `old` if `old` was in `done`; `extra` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` except `a[r - m]` if `old` was in `extra`; `j` is `m-1`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `a[r]` is not in `todo`; `r` is `r + 1`. If `old` was in `done`, `old` is added to `todo` and removed from `done`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `a[r]` is added to `extra`. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
