The code snippet `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `extra`. Since `extra` was initially an empty set, after this operation, `extra` will contain the element `a[j]`. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input; `done` is an empty set; `extra` is a set containing the element `a[j]`.**
