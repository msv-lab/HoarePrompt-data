The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
