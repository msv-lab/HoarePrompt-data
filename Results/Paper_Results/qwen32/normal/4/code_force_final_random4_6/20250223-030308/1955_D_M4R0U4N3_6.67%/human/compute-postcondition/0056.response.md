Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is any integer; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input with `a[r]` removed if `a[r]` was in `todo`, and if `old` was in `extra`, it is now removed from `extra`; if `old` was in `done`, it is now removed from `done` and added to `todo`. `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` with adjustments based on the presence of `old`, and now includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`. `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, with `old` removed if it was present, and now includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. `j` is `m`; `old` is `a[1]`; `r` is `m + 1`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it has been removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If the length of `done` is now greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 3; otherwise, `ans` is 2.**
