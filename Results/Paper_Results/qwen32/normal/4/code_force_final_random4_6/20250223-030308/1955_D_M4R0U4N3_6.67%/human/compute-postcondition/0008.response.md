The code snippet `todo.remove(a[j])` removes the element `a[j]` from the set `todo`. Since `a[j]` is an element of `todo`, after this operation, `a[j]` will no longer be in `todo`.

Given the initial state, `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input. After removing `a[j]` from `todo`, `todo` will no longer contain `a[j]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input except it no longer contains `a[j]`; `done` is an empty set; `extra` is an empty set.**
