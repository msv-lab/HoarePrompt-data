Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input, except it no longer contains `a[4]` if `a[4]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing `a[4]` if `a[4]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set; `extra` is a set containing `a[4]` if `a[4]` was not in `todo`; `j` is 4.**
