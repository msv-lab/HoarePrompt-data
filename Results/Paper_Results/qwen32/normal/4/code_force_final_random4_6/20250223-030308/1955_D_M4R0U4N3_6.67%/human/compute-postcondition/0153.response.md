The code snippet `done.add(a[j])` adds the element at index `j` of the list `a` to the set `done`. Given that `j` is initialized to `m-1`, the element `a[m-1]` will be added to the set `done`.

Here are the updated states of the variables:
- `done` was an empty set and now it contains the element `a[m-1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is the second integer provided by the input and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer provided by the input and is greater than `m`; `k` is the third integer provided by the input; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the latest input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input with `a[j]` removed; `done` is a set containing `a[m-1]`; `extra` is an empty set; `j` is `m-1`; `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.**
