The code snippet adds the value of `old` to the `todo` set. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `j`, `r`, `done`, or `ans`. The only change is that `old` is now included in the `todo` set.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `k` is the integer provided by the input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `j` is `m-1`, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[2]` and is not in `extra`, `done` has `old` removed from it, if the length of `done` is less than `k`, `ans` is 1; otherwise, `ans` is 3, `todo` includes `old`.**
