Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input; `done` is a set (now empty); `extra` is a set containing the integer `a[0]`; `j` is 0; `ans` is the number of times during the loop that the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language: The variable `extra` now contains the integer `a[0]`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
