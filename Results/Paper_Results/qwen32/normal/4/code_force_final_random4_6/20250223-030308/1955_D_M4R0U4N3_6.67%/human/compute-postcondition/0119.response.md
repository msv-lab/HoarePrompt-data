Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is the integer provided by the input; `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input, excluding any elements that were in the first `m` elements of `a` and were in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from the first `m` elements of `a` that were not in `todo`, excluding `old` if `old` was in `extra`; `done` is a set of integers with `old` removed; `j` is `m-1`; `r` is `m + 1`; `old` is `a[1]` and is not in `extra`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2.**

Natural Language: The value of `old` (which is `a[1]`) has been removed from the set `done`. All other variables retain their initial values, except for `done`, which no longer contains `old`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged, as it depends on the length of `done` relative to `k`.
