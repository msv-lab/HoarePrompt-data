The code snippet `todo.add(old)` adds the value of `old` to the set `todo`. This means that `old` will now be an element of the set `todo`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `old` was previously in `done` or `extra`, and it has been removed from those sets and added to `todo`. The length of `done` and the values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of unique integers with `old` added to it; `done` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `done`, and includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`, but `old` is removed from `done`; `extra` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra`, and includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`; `j` is `m-1`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `a[r]` is not in `todo`; If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1; `r` is `r + 1`.**
