The code snippet `extra.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the set `extra`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `old` is `a[r - m]`, and since `extra` initially contains elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]`, removing `old` will update `extra` by removing `a[r - m]` from it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of unique integers; `done` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]`; `extra` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` except `a[r - m]`; `j` is `m-1`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `a[r]` is not in `todo`; `r` is `r + 1`.**
