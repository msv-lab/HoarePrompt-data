Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input, excluding any elements that were in the first `m` elements of `a` and were in `todo`; `done` is a set containing all elements from the first `m` elements of `a` that were in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from the first `m` elements of `a` that were not in `todo`; `j` is `m-1`; `ans` is 1 if len(done) >= k else 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is the integer provided by the input; `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input, excluding any elements that were in the first `m` elements of `a` and were in `todo`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it has been removed from `todo` and `a[m]` is added to `done`. If `a[r]` was not in `todo`, `a[m]` is added to `extra`. `extra` is a set containing all elements from the first `m` elements of `a` that were not in `todo`, excluding `old` if `old` was in `extra`. `done` is a set of integers, and if `old` was in `done`, `old` is now in `todo` and removed from `done`. `j` is `m-1`; `r` is `m`; `old` is `a[0]` and is not in `extra`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is the integer provided by the input; `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input; `j` is `m-1`; `r` is `m + 1`; `old` is `a[1]` and is not in `extra`. If the length of `done` is less than `k`, `ans` is 1; otherwise, `ans` is 3. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`. If `old` was in `extra`, `todo` and `extra` remain unchanged. If `old` was not in `extra`, `old` is added to `todo` if it was in `done`, and removed from `done` if it was present.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `k` is the integer provided by the input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `j` is `m-1`, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[2]` and is not in `extra`. If `old` was in `extra`, the state remains unchanged. If `old` was in `done`, it is now removed from `done` and included in `todo`. If the length of `done` is less than `k`, `ans` is 1; otherwise, `ans` is 3. If `old` was not in `done`, `ans` and `todo` remain unchanged. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `a[r]` is added to `extra`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
