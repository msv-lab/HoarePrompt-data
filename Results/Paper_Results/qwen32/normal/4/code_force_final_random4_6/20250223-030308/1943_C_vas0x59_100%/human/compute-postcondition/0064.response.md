The code appends the tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `ops` already contains the tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, and the newly appended `(c1, i)`, after executing the given code, `ops` will have an additional tuple `(c2, i)` appended to it.

The values of `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ci2`, `ci1`, `c1`, and `c2` remain unchanged. The value of `i` remains `i + 2`.

Output State: **`u2vs` remains unchanged, `d` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `previous` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `path_ba` is a list with more than one element, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, `(c1, i)`, and the newly appended `(c2, i)`, the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`, `i` is `i + 2`.**
