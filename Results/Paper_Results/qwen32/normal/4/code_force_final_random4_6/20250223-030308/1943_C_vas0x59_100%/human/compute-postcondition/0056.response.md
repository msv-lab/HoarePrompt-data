Output State: **`u2vs` remains unchanged as it is a list of adjacency lists representing the tree; `d` remains unchanged as it is the list of distances from vertex `a` to all other vertices; `a` remains unchanged as it is the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` remains unchanged as it is the list of previous vertices for the shortest path tree; `b` remains unchanged as it is also the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` will be a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is even; `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`.**
