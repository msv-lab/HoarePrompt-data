The function reads a tree structure with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges, finds the longest path in the tree, and then prints a series of operations based on the middle point(s) of this longest path. It outputs the number of operations and the details of each operation, where each operation is represented by a vertex index and a distance value. The function does not modify the input tree structure and returns `None`.
