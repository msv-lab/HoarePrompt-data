### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine if it's possible to distribute water equally among the containers based on the given constraints and operations allowed. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Calculate the Total Water and Target**: The program first calculates the total amount of water across all containers and then determines the target amount of water each container should have if the water were distributed equally. This is done by dividing the total water by the number of containers `n`.

2. **Check Feasibility of Distribution**: The program then iterates through the list of water amounts in each container. It keeps a running balance (`container`) which starts at 0 and is updated by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the target amount. If at any point this balance (`container`) goes negative, it means that to make the current container's water amount equal to the target, more water would need to be taken from a previous container, which is not allowed by the problem constraints (i.e., water can only be poured from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index).

3. **Return Result**: If the balance never goes negative during the iteration, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the water can be distributed equally. If the balance goes negative at any point, it returns 'No', indicating that it is not possible to distribute the water equally under the given constraints.

### Analysis:
The logic of the program is correct based on the problem constraints. The key insight is that if you can iterate through the containers and ensure that you never need to take water from a container that appears later in the list (which would require a negative balance), then it is possible to distribute the water equally by only moving water from earlier containers to later ones.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the water can be distributed equally among the containers given the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
