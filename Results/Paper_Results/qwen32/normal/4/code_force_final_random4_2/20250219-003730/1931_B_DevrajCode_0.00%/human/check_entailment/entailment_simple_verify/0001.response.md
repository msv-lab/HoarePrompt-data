Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotations to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from container `i` to container `j` where `i < j`. The sum of water in all containers is guaranteed to be divisible by `n`.

### Key Insight:
- The target amount of water each container should have is `total_water // n`.
- We need to check if we can redistribute the water such that no container ever ends up with a negative amount of water during the process.

### Code Analysis:
The code correctly calculates the total amount of water and the target amount per container. It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a running sum (`container`) that represents the net amount of water that would be left if we were to pour water from left to right to achieve the target. If at any point this running sum becomes negative, it means we cannot achieve the desired distribution, and the function returns 'No'. If the loop completes without the running sum going negative, it returns 'Yes'.

### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm the state of the program at key points, showing that the total water is divisible by `n` and that the target is correctly calculated.
- During the loop, the running sum (`container`) is updated correctly, and the check for negativity is in place.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies the key insight and the logic implemented in the code. It concludes that the code is correct because it checks if it's possible to pour water from left to right without ever having a negative amount of water, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the problem.

### Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The code correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the given operation. The annotations support this by showing the correct state transitions and conditions being checked.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

### Reasoning:
The code correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by ensuring that we can pour water from left to right without ever having a negative amount of water in any container. The annotations confirm the correctness of the logic at each step. Therefore, the given program is correct.
