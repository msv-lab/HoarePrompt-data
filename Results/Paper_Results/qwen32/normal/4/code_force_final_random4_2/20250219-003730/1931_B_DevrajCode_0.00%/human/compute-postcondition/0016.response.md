Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `total_water` is divisible by `n`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, and `container` is updated to `container + (water - target)`. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, `container` remains updated as `container + (water - target)` without returning anything. `water` is the next element in the list `a` that has not been processed yet.**

Natural Language: The value of `container` is updated by adding the difference between `water` and `target`. All other variables remain unchanged. If `container` becomes less than 0, the program would return 'No', but this specific check is not performed in the given code snippet.
