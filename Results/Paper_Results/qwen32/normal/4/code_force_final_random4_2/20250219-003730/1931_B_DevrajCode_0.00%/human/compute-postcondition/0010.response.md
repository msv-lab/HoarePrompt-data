Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `total_water` is divisible by `n`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is updated to `container + (water - target)`, and `container` is not less than 0**
