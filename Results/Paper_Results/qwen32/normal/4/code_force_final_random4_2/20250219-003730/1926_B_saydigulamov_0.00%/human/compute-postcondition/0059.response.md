Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) indicating the size of a grid, followed by `n` lines of `n` characters each, which are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of all the '1's, and the shape is larger than 1x1. The function returns the type of shape ("triangle" or "square") for each test case.**
