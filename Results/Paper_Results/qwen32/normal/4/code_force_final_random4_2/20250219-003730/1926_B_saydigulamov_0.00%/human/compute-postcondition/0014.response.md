The code snippet appends the count of the character '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. The variable `i` remains uninitialized and `a` retains its value. The string `b` is equal to the new user's input.

The output state is:
Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, `i` is not yet initialized, `k` is a list with the last element being the count of '1' in `b`, `b` is a string equal to the new user's input.**
