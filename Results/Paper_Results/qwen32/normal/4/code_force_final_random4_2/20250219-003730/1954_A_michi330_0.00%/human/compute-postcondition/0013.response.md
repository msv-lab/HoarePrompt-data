The only variable in the loop head of the given `for` loop is `itest`. According to the loop statement `for itest in range(0, t, 1)`, `itest` is incremented by 1 after each iteration. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
- `itest` is 1.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input and remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `itest` must be incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `itest` will be 2.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `itest` is 2, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.**
