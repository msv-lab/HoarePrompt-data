To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic behind it and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem states that Alice wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, even if he repaints up to `k` parts. The key insight is that if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that the maximum number of parts of any single color is less than or equal to `n - k`, then Bob will not be able to make all parts the same color.

The given program uses the following logic:
- If `n <= k`, it prints 'NO' because Bob can repaint all parts to the same color.
- If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it prints 'NO'. This condition checks if the maximum number of parts of any single color (which is `math.ceil(n / m)`) is such that Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.
- Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

Let's verify this logic with the example test cases:

1. For `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`:
   - `n <= k` is true, so it prints 'NO'.
   - This is correct because Bob can repaint the single part.

2. For `n = 5`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`:
   - `n <= k` is false.
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 5 = 0 < 1` is true, so it prints 'NO'.
   - This is correct because Bob can repaint one part to make all parts the same color.

3. For `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 1`:
   - `n <= k` is false.
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 >= 1` is false, so it prints 'YES'.
   - This is correct because Alice can paint the ribbon as [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], and Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting one part.

4. For `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`:
   - `n <= k` is false.
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 < 2` is false, so it prints 'NO'.
   - This is correct because Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color by repainting two parts.

5. For `n = 5`, `m = 5`, `k = 3`:
   - `n <= k` is false.
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 1 = 4 >= 3` is true, so it prints 'YES'.
   - This is correct because Alice can paint each part a different color, and Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting three parts.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

**Correctness: True**
