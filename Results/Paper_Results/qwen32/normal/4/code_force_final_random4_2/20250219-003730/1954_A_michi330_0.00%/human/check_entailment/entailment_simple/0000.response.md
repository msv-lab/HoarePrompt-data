### Reasoning:

To determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, we need to analyze the conditions under which Bob can or cannot achieve his goal.

1. **Case 1: \( n \leq k \)**
   - If the number of parts \( n \) is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint \( k \), then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color. Thus, Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color in this case.
   
2. **Case 2: \( n - \left\lceil \frac{n}{m} \right\rceil < k \)**
   - Here, \( \left\lceil \frac{n}{m} \right\rceil \) represents the minimum number of parts that would have the same color if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible (i.e., the maximum number of parts with the same color).
   - If \( n - \left\lceil \frac{n}{m} \right\rceil < k \), it means that there are not enough parts with different colors to prevent Bob from repainting the parts to make all parts the same color. Essentially, Bob can repaint the parts that are not the most frequent color to match the most frequent color.
   
3. **Otherwise**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it means that Alice can distribute the colors in such a way that no single color dominates the ribbon to the extent that Bob can repaint just \( k \) parts to make all parts the same color. This is because \( n - \left\lceil \frac{n}{m} \right\rceil \geq k \) implies that there are enough parts of different colors to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color with just \( k \) repaints.

### Conclusion:

The logic in the provided program correctly captures these conditions. If either \( n \leq k \) or \( n - \left\lceil \frac{n}{m} \right\rceil < k \), it prints "NO", indicating that Bob can make all parts the same color. Otherwise, it prints "YES", indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.
