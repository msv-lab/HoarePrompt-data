Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, given that Bob can repaint at most `k` parts.

The key insight is that if Alice can paint the ribbon such that no single color appears more than `n - k` times, then Bob will not be able to repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. 

Let's analyze the given program:

1. **Condition `n <= k`:**
   - If `n` (the number of parts) is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color. Therefore, the output should be "NO".
   
2. **Condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`:**
   - This condition checks if the number of parts that cannot be repainted (i.e., `n - math.ceil(n / m)`) is less than `k`.
   - `math.ceil(n / m)` represents the minimum number of parts that must have the same color if the ribbon is painted using `m` colors as evenly as possible. 
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means that Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. Therefore, the output should be "NO".

3. **Else:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it implies that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. Therefore, the output should be "YES".

The logic in the program aligns with the reasoning above. Thus, the program correctly determines whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

Correctness: **True**
