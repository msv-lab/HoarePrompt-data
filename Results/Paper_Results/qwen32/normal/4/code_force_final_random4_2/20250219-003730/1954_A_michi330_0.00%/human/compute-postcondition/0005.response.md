Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `itest` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, and it is not the case that (n ≤ k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k)**

This means that both conditions `n ≤ k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` must be false. Therefore, `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) ≥ k`.
