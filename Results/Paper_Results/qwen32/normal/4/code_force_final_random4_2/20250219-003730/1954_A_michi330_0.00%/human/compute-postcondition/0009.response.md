The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged except for `n`, `m`, and `k` which are updated by the input values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000), `itest` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.**
