Given the initial state, we have the following information:

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `itest` is 0.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.
- The condition `(n â‰¤ k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k)` is not true, meaning the condition is false.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This `print` statement will output the string 'Yes' regardless of the values of `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k` because the print statement is hardcoded to output 'Yes'.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **Yes**
