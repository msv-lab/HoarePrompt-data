The given code snippet updates the `xylist` variable by splitting the input string `t` into a list of strings based on spaces. The initial state specifies that `t` is a string, and `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces. However, the code snippet reassigns `xylist` to the new list generated by `input().split(' ')`. This means the previous value of `xylist` is overwritten.

The variables `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `xylist` and the unchanged values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `i`.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input value, `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element in `xylist`, `y` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[1]`, `i` is 1, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input by spaces.**
