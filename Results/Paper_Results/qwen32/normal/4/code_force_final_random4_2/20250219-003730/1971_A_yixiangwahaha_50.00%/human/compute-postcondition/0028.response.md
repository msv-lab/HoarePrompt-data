To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

Initial State:
- `t` is a string representing the input value.
- `x` is a list containing ten integers.
- `y` is a list containing ten integers.
- `i` is 2.
- `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces for the last iteration.

The print statement:
```python
print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
```

Given that `i` is 2, we need to determine the values of `y[2]` and `x[2]`.

- `y[2]` is the third element of the list `y`.
- `x[2]` is the third element of the list `x`.

Since the exact values of the lists `x` and `y` are not provided, we cannot determine the numerical values of `y[2]` and `x[2]`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these elements.

Output: **y[2]   x[2] (where y[2] is the third element of the list y and x[2] is the third element of the list x)**
