Reasoning:

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct based on the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range**: The program is hardcoded to iterate 10 times (`for i in range(10)`), regardless of the value of `t`. This is incorrect because `t` can be any integer from 1 to 100, and the program should iterate `t` times instead of always 10 times.

2. **Unused Variable `t`**: The variable `t` is read from the input but is not used in the loop that processes the test cases. This means the program will always process 10 test cases, regardless of the actual number of test cases provided.

3. **Output Formatting**: The output includes an extra space after the first number in each pair. The problem description specifies the output format as two integers separated by a single space, without any additional spaces.

To correct the program, the loop should iterate `t` times, and the output should be formatted correctly without extra spaces.

Given these issues, the program is not correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
