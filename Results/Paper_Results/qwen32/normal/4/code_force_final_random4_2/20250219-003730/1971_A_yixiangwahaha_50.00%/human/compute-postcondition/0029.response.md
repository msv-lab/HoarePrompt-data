Postcondition: **`t` is a string representing the input value, `x` is a list containing ten integers, `y` is a list containing ten integers, `i` is 2, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces for the last iteration. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `i`, and `xylist` remain unchanged regardless of whether `x[i] < y[i]` or not.**
