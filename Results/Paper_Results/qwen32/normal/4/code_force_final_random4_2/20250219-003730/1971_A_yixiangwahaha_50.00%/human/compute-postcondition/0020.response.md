Let's break down the given initial state and determine the output of the provided print statement.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is a string representing the input value.
2. `x` is a list containing ten integers.
3. `y` is a list containing ten integers.
4. `i` is initialized to 0.
5. `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input `t` by spaces for the last iteration.
6. `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
```

### Analysis:
- `i` is 0, so the statement will print the first elements of the lists `y` and `x`.
- `y[i]` refers to the first element of the list `y`, which is `y[0]`.
- `x[i]` refers to the first element of the list `x`, which is `x[0]`.
- The condition `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]` ensures that `x[0] >= y[0]`, but this condition does not affect the output directly, it just provides a constraint on the values.

### Output:
The print statement will output the first element of `y` followed by a space and then the first element of `x`.

Output: **y[0]  x[0] (where y[0] is the first element of the list y and x[0] is the first element of the list x)**
