Correctness: **False**

The provided program assumes that there are always exactly 10 test cases, which does not align with the problem description. The problem specifies that the number of test cases, `t`, can vary from 1 to 100. The program should instead use the value of `t` to determine the number of iterations for reading input and processing test cases. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Convert the input to an integer
    for _ in range(t):  # Use t to determine the number of test cases
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x = int(xylist[0])
        y = int(xylist[1])
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))  # Use built-in min and max functions for clarity

func()
```

This version reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case accordingly.
