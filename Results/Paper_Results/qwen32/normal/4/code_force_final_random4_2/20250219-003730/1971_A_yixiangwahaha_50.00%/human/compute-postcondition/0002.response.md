The given code snippet assigns an empty list to the variable `y`. This means that `y` is now `[]`. The variable `x` is already stated to be an empty list and remains unchanged. The variable `t` is a string representing the input value and is also not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input value, and for each of the `t` test cases, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9; `x` is an empty list; `y` is an empty list.**
