Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is a string representing the input value.
- `x` is a list containing ten integers.
- `y` is a list containing ten integers.
- `i` is 0.
- `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces for the last iteration.
- `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
```

### Analysis:
- `i` is 0, so we are interested in the first elements of the lists `x` and `y`.
- The condition `x[i] < y[i]` tells us that the first element of `x` is less than the first element of `y`.
- The print statement will output the first element of `x`, followed by a space, and then the first element of `y`.

### Output:
Since `i` is 0, `x[i]` is `x[0]` and `y[i]` is `y[0]`. The exact values of `x[0]` and `y[0]` are not provided, but we know that `x[0] < y[0]`.

Output: **x[0] y[0] (where x[0] is the first element of the list x and y[0] is the first element of the list y, with x[0] < y[0])**
