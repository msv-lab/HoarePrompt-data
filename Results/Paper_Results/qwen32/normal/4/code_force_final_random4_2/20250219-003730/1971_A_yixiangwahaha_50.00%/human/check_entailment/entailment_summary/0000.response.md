Reasoning:  
The given problem requires handling multiple test cases, where for each test case, two integers are provided, and the output should be the minimum of the two integers followed by the maximum. The provided program, however, has a few issues:

1. It reads an integer `t` (the number of test cases) but does not use it. Instead, it assumes there are always 10 test cases.
2. It reads exactly 10 pairs of integers `x` and `y` regardless of the value of `t`, which could lead to errors if `t` is not 10.
3. The program uses hardcoded loops of 10 iterations, which is incorrect if the number of test cases is different from 10.

Given the execution summary, the program does produce the correct output for the provided input (which happens to have 10 test cases). However, the program is not generalizable to any number of test cases as specified in the problem statement.

Since the problem statement requires a solution that works for any number of test cases between 1 and 100, the provided program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
