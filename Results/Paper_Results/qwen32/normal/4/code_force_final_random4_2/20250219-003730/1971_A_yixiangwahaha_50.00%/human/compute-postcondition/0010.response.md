The code appends the integer value of `xylist[1]` to the list `y`. Given that `y` initially contains one integer value from `xylist[1]`, after the operation, `y` will contain two identical integer values of `xylist[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input value, `x` is a list containing two identical integer values of `xylist[0]`, `y` is a list containing two identical integer values of `xylist[1]`, `i` is 1, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input by spaces.**
