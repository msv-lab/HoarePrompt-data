You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` and then reads ten pairs of integers `x` and `y`. For each pair, it prints the smaller number followed by the larger number.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum and maximum of two integers for each of a given number of test cases. However, there are several issues with the code that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. The program assumes there are always 10 test cases by iterating 10 times in the for loops, which is not correct. The number of test cases `t` is provided as input and can vary between 1 and 100.
2. The program does not use the value of `t` to control the number of iterations in the for loops. Instead, it hardcoded the loop to run 10 times, which will cause errors if there are fewer than 10 test cases or will not process all test cases if there are more than 10.
3. The print statement includes an extra space after the minimum value, which is not required according to the output format specified in the problem description.

To correct the program, the number of iterations in the for loops should be determined by the value of `t`, and the print statement should be adjusted to match the required output format.

Correctness: **False**
