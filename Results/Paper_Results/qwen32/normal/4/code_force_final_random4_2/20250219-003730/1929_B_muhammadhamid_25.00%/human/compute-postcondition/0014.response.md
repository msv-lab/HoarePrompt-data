The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and jumps to the next iteration of the loop. However, in the given code snippet, there is no loop structure (`for` or `while`), so the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables `t`, `n`, or `k`.

Since there is no loop, the `continue` statement is effectively a no-op (no operation) in this context. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input**.
