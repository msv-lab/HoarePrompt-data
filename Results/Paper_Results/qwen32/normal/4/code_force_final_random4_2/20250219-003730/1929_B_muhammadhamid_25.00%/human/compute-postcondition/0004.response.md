The code snippet provided is simply `continue`, which is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, there is no loop in the provided context. Therefore, the `continue` statement has no effect in this context.

Since the `continue` statement does not alter the values of any variables or the state of the program, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **The input must provide an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input. The current value of `k` is 1.**
