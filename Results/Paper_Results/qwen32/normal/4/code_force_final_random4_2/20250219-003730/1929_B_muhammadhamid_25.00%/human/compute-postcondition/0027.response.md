Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each test case, the appropriate result based on the values of `n` and `k` has been printed. The variable `t` is now 0, and no further test cases remain to be processed.**

In simpler terms, the loop has finished processing all `t` test cases, and for each test case, the correct number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell has been determined and printed. The value of `t` is now 0, indicating that there are no more test cases to handle.
