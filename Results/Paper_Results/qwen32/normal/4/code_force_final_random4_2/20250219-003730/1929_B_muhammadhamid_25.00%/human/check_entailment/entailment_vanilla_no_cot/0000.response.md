Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in order to ensure that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. Let's analyze why this is the case.

### Explanation of the Problem:

1. **Diagonals in a Grid:**
   - A square grid of size `n x n` has `4n - 2` diagonals.
   - These diagonals can be classified into two types:
     - **Main Diagonals:** Diagonals that run from the top-left to the bottom-right or from the top-right to the bottom-left.
     - **Off-Diagonals:** Diagonals that are not main diagonals.

2. **Coloring Strategy:**
   - To minimize the number of colored cells, we need to strategically place the colored cells such that they cover as many diagonals as possible.
   - **Main Diagonals:** Placing a colored cell on a main diagonal covers two diagonals (one from top-left to bottom-right and one from top-right to bottom-left).
   - **Off-Diagonals:** Placing a colored cell on an off-diagonal covers only one diagonal.

### Analysis of the Program:

- The program attempts to handle the problem by checking the value of `k` and applying a simple formula:
  - If `k == 1`, it correctly outputs `1`.
  - If `k <= 2 * n`, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
  - If `k > 2 * n`, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.

- **Issues with the Formula:**
  - The formula `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2 + 1` does not account for the structure of the diagonals in the grid.
  - It does not consider the fact that placing a cell on a main diagonal can cover two diagonals, which can be more efficient than placing cells on off-diagonals.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. **Identify Main Diagonals:**
   - The main diagonals (both types) can be covered with fewer cells because each cell on a main diagonal covers two diagonals.
2. **Calculate the Minimum Cells:**
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n - 2` (the number of main diagonals), we can use the formula `math.ceil(k / 2)` because we can place cells on main diagonals.
   - If `k` is greater than `2 * n - 2`, we need to use additional cells on off-diagonals to cover the remaining diagonals.

### Correct Solution:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        main_diagonals = 2 * n - 2
        if k <= main_diagonals:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            # Cover as many main diagonals as possible
            cells_needed = math.ceil(main_diagonals / 2)
            remaining_diagonals = k - main_diagonals
            cells_needed += remaining_diagonals
            print(cells_needed)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum number of cells needed by considering the structure of the diagonals in the grid.
