In the given initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are described. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(1)`, which directly prints the integer `1` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the variable `t` as `t - 1`, which implies that `t` is being updated to one less than its previous value. However, this operation does not affect the `print` statement.
2. The variables `n` and `k` are mentioned as integers obtained from the input, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
3. The `print(1)` statement explicitly specifies that the integer `1` should be printed.

Therefore, the output will be the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
