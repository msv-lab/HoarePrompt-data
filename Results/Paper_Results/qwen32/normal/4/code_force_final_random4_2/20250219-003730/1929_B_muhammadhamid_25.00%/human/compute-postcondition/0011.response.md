The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use. In this context, the loop variable is not actually used within the loop body, and the loop simply iterates `t` times.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The state at the end of the previous iteration includes:
- `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
- `n` and `k` are integers derived from the input, with specific conditions on `k` based on its value relative to `n`.

Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state of `t`, `n`, or `k`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the loop counter itself, which is implicitly managed by the `range` function in Python.

At the start of the next iteration, the loop counter (represented by `_`) will automatically be incremented by 1 by the `range` function. Therefore, we do not need to manually adjust `_`. However, we do need to ensure that the loop can execute again, which means `t` must be decremented by 1 to reflect that one iteration has completed.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input with the same conditions as before**.
