Let's break down the given task step by step based on the initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- **`t`** is defined as `t - 1`, but its exact value is not provided. This operation does not affect the output of the `print` statement directly.
- **`n`** and **`k`** are integers obtained from the input.
- If `k` equals 1, the state remains as `t` is `t - 1`, and `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input. 
- If `k` does not equal 1, there is no change in the state.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement computes the value of `k // 2 + 1` and prints it.
- The operation `k // 2` is an integer division, which means it divides `k` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
- Adding 1 to the result of `k // 2` gives the final value to be printed.

### Possible Values:
- **If `k` is 1:**
  - `k // 2` results in `0` (since 1 divided by 2 is 0.5, which rounds down to 0).
  - Adding 1 to `0` results in `1`.
  - Therefore, the output will be `1`.

- **If `k` is any other integer:**
  - The value of `k // 2 + 1` will be computed based on the specific value of `k`.
  - For example, if `k` is 2, `k // 2` is `1`, and `1 + 1` is `2`.
  - If `k` is 3, `k // 2` is `1`, and `1 + 1` is `2`.
  - If `k` is 4, `k // 2` is `2`, and `2 + 1` is `3`, and so on.

### Conclusion:
The output depends on the value of `k`. However, since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can describe the output in terms of `k`.

### Final Output:
Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the integer obtained from the input)**
