Let's analyze the problem and the program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The grid has a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals, consisting of:
- \( n \) diagonals from the top-left to the bottom-right (main diagonals and those parallel to them).
- \( n \) diagonals from the top-right to the bottom-left (anti-diagonals and those parallel to them).

### Key Observations

1. **Minimum Cells for Minimum Diagonals**:
   - If \( k = 1 \), we need to color only 1 cell to cover at least one diagonal.
   - If \( k \leq 2n \), we can cover \( k \) diagonals by coloring cells in a strategic manner. Specifically, coloring cells in the middle row and column can help cover multiple diagonals efficiently.
   - If \( k > 2n \), we need to cover more diagonals, and the strategy involves coloring cells in a way that maximizes the number of diagonals covered per cell.

2. **Formulating the Solution**:
   - For \( k \leq 2n \), the solution can be derived by coloring cells in a way that each cell covers as many diagonals as possible. This can be mathematically expressed as \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
   - For \( k > 2n \), the solution involves a more complex pattern but can be simplified to \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) as well, which is equivalent to \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) for odd \( k \) and \( \frac{k}{2} \) for even \( k \).

### Program Analysis

The provided program follows the above observations and logic:
- For \( k = 1 \), it directly prints 1.
- For \( k \leq 2n \), it calculates \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) using `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
- For \( k > 2n \), it calculates \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) using `k // 2 + 1`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic derived from the problem analysis. It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
