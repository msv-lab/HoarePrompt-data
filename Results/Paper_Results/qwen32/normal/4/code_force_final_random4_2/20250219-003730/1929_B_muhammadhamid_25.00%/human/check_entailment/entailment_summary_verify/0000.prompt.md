You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid size `n` and a requirement `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to ensure that at least `k` diagonals of the `n x n` grid contain at least one colored cell.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

Let's analyze the program and the problem description to see if the program meets all the requirements.

The problem description states that Sasha needs to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals contain at least one colored cell. The diagonals include both the main diagonals (from top-left to bottom-right and from top-right to bottom-left) and the off-diagonals.

The program provided is as follows:
```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
```

Let's test this program with some cases:

1. **Test Case: \( n = 3, k = 4 \)**
   - Expected Output: 2
   - Program Output: 2
   - Correct

2. **Test Case: \( n = 3, k = 3 \)**
   - Expected Output: 2
   - Program Output: 2
   - Correct

3. **Test Case: \( n = 3, k = 10 \)**
   - Expected Output: 6
   - Program Output: 5
   - Incorrect

For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \), the program outputs 5, but the correct answer is 6. To understand why, let's see the diagonals of a \( 3 \times 3 \) grid:

- Main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)
- Main diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)
- Off-diagonals (top-left to bottom-right): (1,2), (2,3) and (2,1), (3,2)
- Off-diagonals (top-right to bottom-left): (1,2), (2,1) and (2,3), (3,2)

There are a total of \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \) diagonals. To cover all 10 diagonals, we need to color at least 6 cells. The program's logic fails in this case.

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly, and the Correctness is **False**.
