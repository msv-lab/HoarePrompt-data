Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input. Regardless of whether `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, no changes are made to `n` or `k`.**

This postcondition captures the fact that the value of `t` is decremented by 1 in both the if and else parts of the statement, while `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
