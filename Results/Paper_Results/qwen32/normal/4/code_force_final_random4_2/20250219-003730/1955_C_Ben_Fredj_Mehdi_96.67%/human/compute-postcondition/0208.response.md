The `print('0')` statement in the given code snippet will output the string '0', regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` as described in the initial state. The print statement explicitly specifies the output to be '0'.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, `k`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the string '0'.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply '0'.

Output: **0**
