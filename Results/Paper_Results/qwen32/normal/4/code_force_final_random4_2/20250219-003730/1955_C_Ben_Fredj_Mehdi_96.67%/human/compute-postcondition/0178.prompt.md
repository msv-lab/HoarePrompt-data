Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character, `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the first space character to the end, `d` is the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input with the first element and the last element each decreased by 1 if no exception occurs. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character, `k` is an integer value of at least 2, `d` is the length of `a` minus 1, and `a[d]` is not 0 if it was initially 1. If `a[g]` is 0, then `g` is incremented to 1; otherwise, `g` remains 0. If `a[d]` is 0, `d` is updated to the length of `a` minus 2. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers where `a[g]` is decreased by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character, `k` is an integer value of at least 2, `d` is the length of `a` minus 1 if `a[d]` is not 0, otherwise `d` is the length of `a` minus 2, `a[d]` is `a[d] - 1`. If `a[g]` is 0, then `g` is incremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `i` is incremented by 1 if no exception occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `z` is 1; `a` is a list of integers where `a[g]` and `a[d]` are each decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character; `k` is an integer value of at least 2; `d` is decremented by 1 if `a[d]` becomes 0; `g` is incremented by 1 if `a[g]` becomes 0; `i` is incremented by 1 if no exception occurs; if an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state is unknown.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
