The `print('1')` statement will output the string '1'. This is a direct print statement that outputs the string literal '1', regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `z` is initialized to 0.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space, and it is mentioned that `k` is not equal to 1999999998. However, in the current state, `k` is 1999999999.

Despite these details about the variables, the `print('1')` statement does not depend on any of these variables. It simply prints the string '1'.

Output: **1**
