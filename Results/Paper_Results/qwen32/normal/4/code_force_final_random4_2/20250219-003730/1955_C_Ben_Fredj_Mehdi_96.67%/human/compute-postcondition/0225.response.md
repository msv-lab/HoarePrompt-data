The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('0')
```

This statement directly prints the string '0' to the console. The values of the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` do not influence the output of this particular `print` statement because the statement is hardcoded to print the string '0'.

Output: **0**
