Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `z` is 1, `a` has `a[g]` and `a[d]` decremented `k // 2` times with `g` and `d` adjusted if elements become 0, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `d` is adjusted based on how many times `a[d]` became 0, `g` is adjusted based on how many times `a[g]` became 0, and `k` is odd.**
