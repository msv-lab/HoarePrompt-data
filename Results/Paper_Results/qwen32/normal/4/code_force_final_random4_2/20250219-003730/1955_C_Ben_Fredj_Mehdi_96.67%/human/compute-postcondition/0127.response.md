Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `z` is set to 1.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from new input.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the first space character to the end.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('0')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('0')`. This statement directly prints the string `'0'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, or `k`.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'0'`.

Output: **0**
