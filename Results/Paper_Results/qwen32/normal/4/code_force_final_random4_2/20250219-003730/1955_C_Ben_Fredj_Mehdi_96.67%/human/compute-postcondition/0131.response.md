Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. `z` is 1.
3. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
4. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character.
5. `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the first space character to the end.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('9')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('9')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, or `k`. It simply prints the string `'9'`.

### Output:
The code prints the string `'9'`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **9**
