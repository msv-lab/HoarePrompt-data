The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'1'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, or `k` mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly given and does not require any calculations or references to other variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('1')`.
2. The argument to the `print` function is the string `'1'`.
3. This string is a literal value and does not change based on any input or variable values.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'1'`.

Output: **1**
