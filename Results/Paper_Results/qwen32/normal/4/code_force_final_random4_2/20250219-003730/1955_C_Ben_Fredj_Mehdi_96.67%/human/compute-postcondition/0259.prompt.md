Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers derived from the user's input string split by spaces, `d` is `len(a) - 1`, `g` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 2. If no exception occurs, `a` is a list with the first and last elements decremented by 1, `g` is incremented to 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, and `d` is decremented to `len(a) - 2` if the last element of `a` is 0. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 2, `a` is a list with the element at index `g` decremented by 1, the element at index `d` of `a` decremented by 1, `g` is incremented by 1 if `a[g]` was 0, `d` is decremented by 1 if `a[d]` was 0, `i` is `i + 1`, and `k` remains the same. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state is unknown.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 1`, `k` remains the same. If no exceptions occur, `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1` and `a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 1`. If `a[g]` was originally 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` was originally 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
