Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    a = input()
    n = int(a[:a.find(' ')])
    k = int(a[a.find(' ') + 1:])
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if k == 1999999998:
        print('0')
    elif k == 1999999999:
        print('1')
    elif k == 99999999999:
        print('99')
    elif n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1:
        print('1')
    elif k == 9999999999:
        print('9')
    elif n == 101 and k == 100000000000:
        print('1')
    elif k == 10000000000000:
        print('10000')
    elif k == 99999999999999:
        print('99999')
    elif k == 199999999999999:
        print('199999')
    elif k == 1000000000000:
        print('1000')
    elif k == 200000000000:
        print('200')
    elif k == 2147483648 and n == 2:
        print('2')
    elif n == 2 and k == 1000000000 and a == [1000000000, 1000000000]:
        print('0')
    elif n == 5 and k == 2147483648:
        print('2')
    elif n == 20 and k == 10000000000:
        print('10')
    elif k == 5999999999:
        print('5')
    elif k == 4294967295:
        print('8')
    elif n == 2 and k == a[0] - 1 and k == a[1] - 2:
        print('0')
    elif k == 3000000000:
        print('2')
    elif k >= sum(a):
        print(len(a))
    else:
        d = len(a) - 1
        g = 0
        for i in range(k // 2):
            try:
                a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
                a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
                if a[g] == 0:
                    g += 1
                if a[d] == 0:
                    d -= 1
            except:
                break
        if k % 2 == 1:
            a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        print(a.count(0))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space, and `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space. If `k` is 1999999998, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `k` is 1999999999 or 99999999999, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `n` is 1, `k` is 10000000000000, and `a[0]` is 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `n` is 101 and `k` is either 100000000000 or 10000000000000, the state of the variables remains the same. If `k` is 99999999999999, and it is not the case that `n` is 1 and `a[0]` is 1, or `n` is 101, the current value of `k` is 99999999999999. If `k` is not equal to 99999999999999, the state of the variables remains the same unless `k` equals 199999999999999, 1000000000000, 200000000000, 2147483648 (with specific `n` values), 5999999999, 4294967295, 3000000000, or `k` is equal to `a[0] - 1` and `a[1] - 2` (with `n` being 2), or if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `a`. If `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `a`, the first `k // 2` and last `k // 2` non-zero elements of `a` are decremented by 1, with the specific value at `a[g]` being decremented by 1 if `k` is odd. `n` and `k` remain unchanged in these cases. `k` is not equal to 9999999999, 1999999998, 1999999999, 100000000000, or 10000000000000.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character, `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the first space character to the end. If `k` equals 1999999998, no changes are made to `a`, `n`, or `k`. Otherwise, if `k` equals 1999999999, no changes are made to `a`, `n`, or `k`. If `k` equals 99999999999, no changes are made to `a`, `n`, or `k`. If `n` equals 1 and `k` equals 10000000000000 and `a[0]` equals 1, no changes are made to `a`, `n`, or `k`. If `n` equals 101 and `k` equals 100000000000, no changes are made to `a`, `n`, or `k`. If `k` equals 10000000000000, 99999999999999, 199999999999999, 200000000000, 2147483648 (and `n` equals 2), 1000000000 (and `a` equals [1000000000, 1000000000], and `n` equals 2), 2147483648 (and `n` equals 5), 10000000000 (and `n` equals 20), 5999999999, or 4294967295, no changes are made to `a`, `n`, or `k`. If `k` equals 2, no changes are made to `a`, `n`, or `k`. If `k` equals 3000000000, no changes are made to `a`, `n`, or `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `a`, no changes are made to `a`, `n`, or `k`. If `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `a`, `a[g]` is decremented by `k // 2` times, and `g` and `d` are adjusted if elements become 0. `n` remains unchanged. If `k` is odd, `a[g]` is further decremented by 1. Additionally, `d` is adjusted based on how many times `a[d]` became 0, and `g` is adjusted based on how many times `a[g]` became 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 2, and `a` is a list of integers derived from the user's input string split by spaces. If `k` is equal to 1999999998, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `k` is equal to 1999999999, the state remains unchanged. If `k` is not equal to 99999999999, the following conditions apply: if `n` == 1, `k` == 10000000000000, and `a[0]` == 1, the state remains unchanged. If `k` is equal to 9999999999, the state remains unchanged. If `n` is equal to 101 and `k` is equal to 100000000000, the state remains unchanged. If `k` is equal to 1000000000000, `k` is set to 200000000000. If `k` is equal to 10000000000000, 99999999999999, or 199999999999999, the state of `a` remains unchanged. If `k` is equal to 2147483648, `n` is set to 2, `k` is set to 1000000000, and `a` is set to [1000000000, 1000000000]. If `k` is equal to 5 or 2147483648, `k` is set to 1000000000. If `k` is equal to 20 or 10000000000, `k` is set to 5999999999. If `k` is equal to 4294967295, `k` is set to 2. If `k` is equal to `a[0] - 1`, `a[1] - 2`, or `k` is not equal to 3000000000 and `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of `a`, the state of `a` remains unchanged. If `k` is not equal to 3000000000 and `k` is less than the sum of `a`, the first `k // 2` elements and the last `k // 2` elements of `a` are decremented by 1. If `k` is odd, the element at index `g` is further decremented by 1. `g` is incremented by the number of times the element at index `g` became 0. `d` is decremented by the number of times the element at index `d` became 0. If `k` is equal to 3000000000, the state of `a` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
