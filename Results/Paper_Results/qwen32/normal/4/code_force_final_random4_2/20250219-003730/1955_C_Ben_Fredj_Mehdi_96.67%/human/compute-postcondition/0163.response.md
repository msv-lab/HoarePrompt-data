Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers where `a[g]` is decreased by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character, `k` is an integer value of at least 2, `d` is the length of `a` minus 1, `a[d]` is `a[d] - 1`, `g` is 1 or 2, `i` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `g` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1 or 2, depending on its initial value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
