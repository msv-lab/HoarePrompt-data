The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'99'`. This string is explicitly provided within the `print` function and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, or `k` as they are defined in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. The variable `z` is set to the integer value 2.
3. The variable `a` is a list of integers derived from a user's input string, split by spaces.
4. The variables `n` and `k` are mentioned as no longer relevant in their previous form.

Despite the presence of these variables, the `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'99'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **99**
