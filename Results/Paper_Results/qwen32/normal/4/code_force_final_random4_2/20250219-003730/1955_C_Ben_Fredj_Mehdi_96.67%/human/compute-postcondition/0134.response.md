Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `z` is 1.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the first space character to the end.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('99999')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement directly prints the string `'99999'`.
- The variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` are defined in the initial state, but they are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'99999'` as it is explicitly provided in the code.

### Final Output:
Output: **99999**
