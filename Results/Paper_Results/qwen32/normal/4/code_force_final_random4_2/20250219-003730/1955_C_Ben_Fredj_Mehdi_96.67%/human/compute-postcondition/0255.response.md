The code snippet provided is `d -= 1`, which decrements the value of `d` by 1. This change only affects the variable `d`, and the other variables (`i`, `k`, `a[g]`, `a[d]`, and `g`) remain unchanged as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` remains the same, `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1`, `a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 1`, `d` is `d - 1`, and if `a[g]` was originally 0, then `g` is `g + 1`.**
