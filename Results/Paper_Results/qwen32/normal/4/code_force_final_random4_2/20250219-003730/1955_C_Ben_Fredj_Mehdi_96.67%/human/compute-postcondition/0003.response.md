The code snippet extracts a substring from the string `a` up to the first space character, converts this substring to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variables `t` and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is the integer value of the substring of `a` up to the first space.**
