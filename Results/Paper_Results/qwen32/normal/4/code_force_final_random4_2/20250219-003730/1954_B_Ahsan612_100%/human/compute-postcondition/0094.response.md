The line of code `same = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `same`. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1, and `_` is `k + 1`.**
