The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given that `minn` is initially `inf` and `same` is `1`, the new value of `minn` will be `1`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `i`, and `ar[i]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 2, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`**.
