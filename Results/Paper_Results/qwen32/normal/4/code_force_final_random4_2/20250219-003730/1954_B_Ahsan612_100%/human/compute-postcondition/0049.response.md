Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 1, `same` is 2, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `minn` is infinity, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
