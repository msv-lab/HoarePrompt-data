The code snippet provided sets the variable `same` to 1. This change affects the value of `same`, but does not affect any other variables. The other variables retain their initial values or conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 4 elements, `_` is `k + 1`, `i` is 3 or 4, `same` is 1, `minn` is the minimum of its initial value and `same`, `num` is `ar[3]` or `ar[4]`.**
