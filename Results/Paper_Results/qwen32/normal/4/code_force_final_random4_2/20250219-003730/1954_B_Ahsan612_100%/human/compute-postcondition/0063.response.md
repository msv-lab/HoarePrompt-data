Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is either 2 or 3 or 4. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, `same` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `num` is set to `ar[3]` if `i` is 3, or `ar[4]` if `i` is 4, `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `same`, and `same` is reset to 1.**
