Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `same` is the count of the last consecutive elements in `ar` that were equal, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`, `num` is the last unique element in `ar`. Additionally, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to `len(ar)`**
