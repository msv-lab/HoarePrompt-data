To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `i < len(ar)`. This means that for the loop to proceed, the value of `i` must be less than the length of the list `ar`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers read from input
- `i` is 1
- `same` is 1
- `num` is `ar[0]`
- `minn` is `inf`
- `_` is `k + 1`

The variable `i` is initialized to 1, so for the loop to execute, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.

Let's analyze the state of `ar`:
- If `ar` has only one element, `len(ar)` would be 1, and the condition `i < len(ar)` (1 < 1) would be false, and the loop would not execute.
- To ensure the loop executes, `ar` must have at least two elements.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the length of `ar`. The initial value of `i` is already 1, so we need to make sure that `ar` has more than one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `minn` is `inf`, and `_` is `k + 1`**
