The code snippet `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. According to the initial state, `i` can be either 3 or 4.

- If `i` is 3, then `num` is set to `ar[3]`.
- If `i` is 4, then `num` is set to `ar[4]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `_`, `same`, and `minn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 4 elements, `_` is `k + 1`, `i` is 3 or 4, `same` is 2 or 1, `minn` is `inf` or 1, `num` is `ar[3]` or `ar[4]`.**
