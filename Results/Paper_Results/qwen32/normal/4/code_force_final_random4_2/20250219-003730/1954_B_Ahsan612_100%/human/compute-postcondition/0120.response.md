Output State: **After all iterations, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, the output will be either -1 or the minimum count of consecutive identical elements in the respective list `ar`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed for all `t` test cases, the variable `t` remains unchanged. For each test case, the code will have processed a list `ar` and determined the minimum count of consecutive identical elements. If no such sequence exists (i.e., all elements are unique or the list is empty), the output will be `-1`. Otherwise, the output will be the smallest count of consecutive identical elements found in the list.
