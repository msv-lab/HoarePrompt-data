The value of `num` is updated to `ar[i]`, which is `ar[3]` since `i` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3, `same` is 2 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num` and 1 otherwise, `num` is `ar[3]`, `minn` is 1**.
