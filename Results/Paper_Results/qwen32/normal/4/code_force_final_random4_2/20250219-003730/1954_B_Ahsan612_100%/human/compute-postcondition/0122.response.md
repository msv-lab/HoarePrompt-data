Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the minimum count of consecutive identical elements in the list `a`. If all elements are identical or no such group exists, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum count of consecutive identical elements.**
