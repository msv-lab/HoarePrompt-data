The code snippet updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. This means that if `same` is less than `minn`, `minn` will be updated to `same`. Otherwise, `minn` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input, `i` is `len(ar)`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements, `num` is the last unique element encountered in the list, `minn` is the minimum of its current value and `same`, `_` is `k + 1`.**
