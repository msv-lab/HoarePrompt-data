The code snippet `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to be equal to the value at index `i` in the list `ar`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `num` will now be equal to `ar[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is `inf`, `i` is 2, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`**. 

In simpler terms, `num` is now `ar[2]`, and all other variables retain their initial values.
