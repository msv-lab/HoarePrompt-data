The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not affect the loop's state directly. However, the loop's execution depends on the value of `t` which is the number of iterations the loop should run. Since `t` is decremented implicitly by the loop control mechanism (the `range` function), we need to adjust `t` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Given that the loop runs `int(input())` times, and assuming `t` is initialized to `int(input())` before the loop starts, at the end of each iteration, the loop control mechanism automatically handles the decrement of the iteration count. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should reflect the remaining number of iterations.

However, since `t` is not directly modified within the loop and is only used to determine the number of iterations, the state at the start of the next iteration would simply be `t` decremented by 1 (since the loop has just completed one iteration).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499, and `ar` is a map object containing strings of sorted integers from the input.**
