**Reasoning:**

The original assessment accurately identifies the issues with the provided program. The program sorts the array correctly but fails to compute the beauty of the array as required by the problem statement. Instead of calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, the program simply prints the sorted array. Therefore, the program does not solve the problem correctly.

The correct approach, as outlined in the original assessment, involves not only sorting the array but also calculating the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The provided code does not perform this crucial step.

**Final:** **False**
