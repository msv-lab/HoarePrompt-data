Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. Instead of calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, the code sorts the array and prints the sorted elements as a space-separated string. The annotations confirm that the code sorts the array and converts the elements to strings, but it does not compute the beauty.

The correct approach, as mentioned in the original assessment, is to sort the array and then compute the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements. The provided code does not perform this calculation.

Final: **False**
