Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
- `ar` is a map object containing strings of sorted integers from the input.

The code snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(ar))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the `ar` Variable**:
   - `ar` is described as a map object. In Python, a map object is an iterator that applies a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list) and returns an iterator of the results.
   - However, in this context, it is mentioned that `ar` contains strings of sorted integers from the input. This implies that `ar` is likely a map object that has already been created and contains these strings.

2. **The `join` Method**:
   - The `join` method is called on the string `' '`, which means that it will concatenate all the elements of `ar` into a single string, with each element separated by a space.

3. **Output**:
   - Since `ar` contains strings of sorted integers, `' '.join(ar)` will concatenate these strings with spaces in between.
   - The exact output will depend on the specific strings of sorted integers that are in `ar`, but we can describe the output format precisely.

### Final Answer:

Given that `ar` contains strings of sorted integers, the `print` statement will output these strings concatenated together with spaces separating them.

Output: **[string of sorted integers from ar, separated by spaces] (where ar is a map object containing strings of sorted integers from the input)**

Since we don't have the specific values of `ar`, we describe the output in terms of its structure:
Output: **sorted integers from ar, separated by spaces (where ar is a map object containing strings of sorted integers from the input)**
