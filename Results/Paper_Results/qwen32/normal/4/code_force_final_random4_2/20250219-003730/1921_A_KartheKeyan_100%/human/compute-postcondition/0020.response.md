Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer minus 1; `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`; `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`; `i` is 3; `x` and `y` are the new integers read from the input; `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between `coord[0]` and `coord[1]`; `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between `coord[3]` and `coord[2]`.**

Natural language: The value of `n` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
