To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the loop's behavior and the given initial and intermediate states. The loop runs while `n` is non-zero, and in each iteration, it reads four coordinate pairs, calculates a value based on the distances between specific pairs, and then decrements `n`. The loop terminates when `n` becomes zero.

From the provided output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that `n` is decremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, after all iterations, `n` will be zero.

Here is the final output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is 0; `l` and `s` are not retained after the loop ends.**

In simpler terms, the final state is that `t` remains unchanged within its initial range, `n` is zero (since the loop has finished executing all its iterations), and `l` and `s` are not relevant to the loop's final state as they are not retained.
