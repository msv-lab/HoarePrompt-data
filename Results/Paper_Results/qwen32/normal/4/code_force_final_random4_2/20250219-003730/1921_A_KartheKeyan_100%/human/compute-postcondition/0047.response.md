The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input, but their specific values are not given. After executing the code, `x` and `y` will hold the values provided by the input, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be non-zero; `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is 4; `p1` is undefined; `p2` is undefined; `x` and `y` are the integers provided by the input.**
