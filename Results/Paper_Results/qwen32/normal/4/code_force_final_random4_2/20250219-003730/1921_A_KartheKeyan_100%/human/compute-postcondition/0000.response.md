The provided code snippet is designed to process `t` test cases, each consisting of a single integer `l`. For each test case, it calculates a value `s` based on the formula `(l//4) + (l - (4*(l//4)))//2` and prints the result. The variable `n` is initially set to the number of test cases `t` and is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the while loop until it reaches 0.

Given the initial state, the variable `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, there is an integer `l` which is used in the calculation. The variable `s` is recalculated and printed for each test case, and `n` is decremented until all test cases are processed.

Since the code processes each test case independently and the value of `t` is decremented until it reaches 0, the final state will have `n` equal to 0, and `t` will have been used to determine the number of iterations. The variables `l` and `s` will not retain any specific value after the loop ends since they are recalculated in each iteration.

Thus, the Output State will be:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is 0; `l` and `s` are not retained after the loop ends**.
