The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be non-zero; `coord` is an empty list; `res` is 0; `i` is 3 (but will be overwritten by the loop); `p1` is undefined; `p2` is undefined; `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input.**
