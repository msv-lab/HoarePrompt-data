The code sorts the list `coord` based on the default sorting behavior, which sorts tuples first by the first element and then by the second element if the first elements are equal.

Given the initial state, the list `coord` contains four tuples:
1. `(original_x1, original_y1)`
2. `(original_x2, original_y2)`
3. `(original_x3, original_y3)`
4. `(x, y)`

After sorting, the order of these tuples in `coord` will depend on the specific values of `original_x1`, `original_y1`, `original_x2`, `original_y2`, `original_x3`, `original_y3`, `x`, and `y`. However, the exact new order is not specified without the actual values.

The values of `t`, `n`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is 1; `coord` is a sorted list of four elements `[(sorted_x1, sorted_y1), (sorted_x2, sorted_y2), (sorted_x3, sorted_y3), (sorted_x4, sorted_y4)]`; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between `coord[0]` and `coord[1]`; `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between `coord[3]` and `coord[2]`.**

In simpler terms, the list `coord` is now sorted, but the specific sorted order depends on the input values. Other variables remain unchanged.
