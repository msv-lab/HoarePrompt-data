The code snippet provided modifies the value of `res` by adding the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it. 

Given the initial state, `i` is `i + 2`, so we use this updated value of `i` in the expression. The values of `t`, `n`, and `mat` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is `i + 2`, `res` is updated by adding `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it.**
