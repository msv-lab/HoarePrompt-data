The code snippet provided modifies the `mat` variable by assigning it a new value, which is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (unchanged).
- `n` is an input integer (unchanged).
- `mat` is now a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`.
- `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to 2 (unchanged).
- `i` is 0 (unchanged).

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to 2, `i` is 0**.
