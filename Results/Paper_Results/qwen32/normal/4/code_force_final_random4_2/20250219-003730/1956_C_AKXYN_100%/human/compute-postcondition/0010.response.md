To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it updates the `res` variable. The loop runs `n` times, and in each iteration, it updates `res` by adding `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it, where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.

Let's break down the loop:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `res` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Body:**
   - For each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, the loop updates `res` by adding `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it.

The expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` is a quadratic expression that contributes to the final value of `res`. To find the final value of `res`, we need to sum this expression from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

The final value of `res` can be calculated as:
\[ \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1) \]

However, we don't need to compute the sum manually since we can directly determine the final state after the loop completes by iterating through the loop and updating `res` accordingly.

Here is the final output state after the loop executes all the iterations:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all `n` iterations, `res` will hold the value of the sum of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `mat`) will remain unchanged as per their initial conditions.
