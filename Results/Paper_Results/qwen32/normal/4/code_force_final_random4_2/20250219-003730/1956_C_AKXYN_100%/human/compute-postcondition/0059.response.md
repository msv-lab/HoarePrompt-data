Let's analyze the given task step by step:

The loop in question is:
```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates with `i` starting from `n` and decrementing by 1 until `i` reaches 1 (inclusive). The loop does not execute when `i` becomes 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is \(n-1\).

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the value of `i` according to the loop's behavior. Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

So, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` is \(n-1\), at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be \(n\).

The value of `n` does not change throughout the loop iterations, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is \(n\)**
