Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of an `n x n` matrix. For each test case, it calculates a specific result based on the formula \(\frac{n(4n^2 + 3n - 1)}{6}\) and prints this result followed by `2 * n`. It then prints a sequence of `2 * n` lines, each representing operations on the matrix, alternating between two types of operations.**
