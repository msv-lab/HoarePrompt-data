To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
1. **`n`**: This is the input integer.
2. **`mat`**: This is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`. However, `mat` is not used in the given print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
3. **`res`**: This is calculated using the formula \(\frac{n(4n^2 + 3n - 1)}{6}\).
4. **`i`**: This is \(n-1\), but `i` is also not used in the given print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(res, n << 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `res`**:
   - The formula for `res` is \(\frac{n(4n^2 + 3n - 1)}{6}\).
   - Let's denote this as `res = \(\frac{n(4n^2 + 3n - 1)}{6}\)`.

2. **Calculate `n << 1`**:
   - The `<<` operator is the left shift operator in Python, which shifts the bits of the number `n` to the left by 1 position. This is equivalent to multiplying `n` by 2.
   - Therefore, `n << 1` is the same as `2 * n`.

### Final Output:
- The `print` statement will output the value of `res` followed by the value of `n << 1`.

Using the above calculations, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **res (where res is \(\frac{n(4n^2 + 3n - 1)}{6}\)), 2 * n (where n is the input integer)**

To make it more precise and adhere to the format:

Output: **\(\frac{n(4n^2 + 3n - 1)}{6}\), 2 * n (where n is the input integer)**
