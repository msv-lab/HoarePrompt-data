The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, and it continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` should be `n-2`. The value of `n` remains unchanged because it defines the starting point of the range.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`**
