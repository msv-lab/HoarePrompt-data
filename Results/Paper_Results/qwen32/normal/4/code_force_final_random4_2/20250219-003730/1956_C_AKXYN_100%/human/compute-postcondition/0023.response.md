`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `t` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of 3 lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to 3, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to 2, and `i` is 0. The value of `n` changes to the input integer.
