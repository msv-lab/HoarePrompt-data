The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n x n matrix. It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5.
