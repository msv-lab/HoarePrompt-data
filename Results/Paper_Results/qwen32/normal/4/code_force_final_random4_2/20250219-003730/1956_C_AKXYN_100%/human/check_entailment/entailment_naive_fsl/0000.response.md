Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix and does not generate the correct sequence of operations to achieve this sum. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Calculation of the Sum**: The sum `res` is calculated as `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. This formula does not correctly compute the sum of the maximum values that can be placed in the matrix. The maximum sum should be the sum of the first `n^2` natural numbers, which is `n^2 * (n^2 + 1) / 2`.

2. **Operations**: The program outputs `n << 1` (which is `2 * n`) operations, but the operations themselves do not guarantee that the matrix will be filled in a way that maximizes the sum. The operations are simply filling the rows and columns with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` in reverse order, which does not ensure the maximum sum.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:
- For `n = 2`, the maximum sum should be `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`, but the program calculates `7` and outputs operations that do not achieve this sum.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:
- For each row `i`, use the permutation `[i, i+1, ..., n, 1, 2, ..., i-1]` to maximize the sum.
- This ensures that each row and column contains all numbers from `1` to `n` exactly once, achieving the maximum possible sum of `n^2 * (n^2 + 1) / 2`.

Thus, the provided program is incorrect.
