### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with zeroes by performing a series of operations. The operations are of two types:
1. Type 1: Assign a permutation \( p \) to a row \( i \).
2. Type 2: Assign a permutation \( p \) to a column \( i \).

The program follows these steps for each test case:
1. **Matrix Initialization**: It initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix `mat` with the first row as \([1, 2, ..., n]\) and all other rows identical to the first row.
2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the sum `res` using the formula \(\frac{n(4n^2 + 3n - 1)}{6}\). This formula is derived from the sum of the series \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} i \times (2i - 1)\), which is the sum of the first \( n \) terms of the sequence \((1 \times 1) + (2 \times 3) + (3 \times 5) + \ldots + (n \times (2n-1))\).
3. **Output**: It prints the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations `2n`. It then prints `2n` operations, each consisting of filling a row and a column with the permutation \([1, 2, ..., n]\).

However, the program does not actually fill the matrix as described in the operations. It only calculates the maximum sum based on the formula and prints the operations without modifying the matrix. The operations printed are correct in terms of syntax and the number of operations, but they do not affect the matrix as intended within the program.

The operations printed ensure that each row and each column will contain the numbers from 1 to \( n \) exactly once, which is the optimal way to maximize the sum of the matrix. The formula used to calculate the sum is correct for the optimal configuration of the matrix.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and prints the operations that would achieve this sum if executed. Therefore, the program is correct in terms of logic and output.

Correctness: **True**
