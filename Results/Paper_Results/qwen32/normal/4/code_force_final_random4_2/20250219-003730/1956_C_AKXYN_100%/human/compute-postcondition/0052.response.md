The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 7, and `i` is 2**
