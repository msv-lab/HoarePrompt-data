Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description. The logic used in the program does not account for the correct calculation of the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program:

1. If `m < a` or `m < b`, the program prints `2`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of fireworks from both installations overlapping within the `m` minute visibility window.
2. If `m >= a` and `m >= b`, the program prints `m // a + m // b + 2`. This is also incorrect because it does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations.

The correct approach should involve calculating the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the `m` minute window and then accounting for the overlap due to the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

Here is a more correct approach to solve the problem:

1. Calculate the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the `m` minute window: `m // a + 1` (the `+1` accounts for the firework launched at time `0`).
2. Calculate the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the `m` minute window: `m // b + 1`.
3. Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the overlap.
4. Calculate the number of overlapping fireworks within the `m` minute window: `m // lcm(a, b) + 1`.
5. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is the sum of the fireworks from both installations minus the overlap.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        fireworks_a = m // a + 1
        fireworks_b = m // b + 1
        fireworks_overlap = m // lcm(a, b) + 1
        print(fireworks_a + fireworks_b - fireworks_overlap)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected code properly handles the overlaps and calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
