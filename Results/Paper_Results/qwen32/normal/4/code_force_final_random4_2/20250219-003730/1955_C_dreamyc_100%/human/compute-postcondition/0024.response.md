The given code snippet increments `s_a` by `nums[i]`. 

Initial State: 
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15
- `nums` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9
- `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`
- `b` is `k // 2`
- `s_a` is `nums[0] + nums[1]`
- `s_b` is `nums[n - 1] + nums[n - i - 1]`
- `i` is 2
- If `s_b` <= `b`, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

The code snippet provided is:
```
s_a += nums[i]
```

This modifies the value of `s_a` by adding `nums[i]` to it. Since `i` is 2, `s_a` is incremented by `nums[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `s_a` is `nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2]`, `s_b` is `nums[n - 1] + nums[n - i - 1]`, `i` is 2, If `s_b` <= `b`, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
