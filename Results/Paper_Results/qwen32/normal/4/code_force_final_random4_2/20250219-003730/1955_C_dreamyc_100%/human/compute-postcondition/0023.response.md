The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `s_a` is `nums[0] + nums[1]`, `s_b` is `nums[n - 1] + nums[n - i - 1]`, `i` is 2. If `s_b` <= `b`, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
