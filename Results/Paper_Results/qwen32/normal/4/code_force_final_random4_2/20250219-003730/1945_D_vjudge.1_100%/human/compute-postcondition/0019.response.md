Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` and `k` (integers where 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000) and two lists `a` and `b` (each of length `n` with integers in the range 1 to 10^9). It calculates and prints the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` from 0 to `k-1`, where `suff[i]` is the sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` from index `i` to `n-1`.**
