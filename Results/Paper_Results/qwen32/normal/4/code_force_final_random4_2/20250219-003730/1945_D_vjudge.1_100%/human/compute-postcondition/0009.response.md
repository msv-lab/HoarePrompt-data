The given code snippet initializes a variable `ans` with the value `float('inf')`. This means `ans` is set to positive infinity. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `suff`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, with each element in the range 1 to 10^9; `c` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` through `c[n-1]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `suff[n]` is `0`; `i` is `-1`; `ans` is `float('inf')`.**
