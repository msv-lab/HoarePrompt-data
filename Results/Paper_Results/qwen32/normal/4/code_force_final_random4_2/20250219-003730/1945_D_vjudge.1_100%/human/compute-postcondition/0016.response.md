Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n; `a` and `b` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, with each element in the range 1 to 10^9; `c` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` through `c[n-1]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `suff[n]` is `0`; `i` is `k-1`; `ans` is the minimum of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`.`**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be `k-1` (which is the last index of the loop), and `ans` will hold the smallest value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `suff` remain unchanged from their initial state.
