The code snippet provided assigns the values returned by `func_1(int)` to the variables `l` and `r`. Since the specific behavior of `func_1` is not provided, we can only infer that `l` and `r` will be assigned some values based on the integer passed to `func_1`.

Given that the integer passed to `func_1` is not specified, we can only say that `l` and `r` will hold the values returned by `func_1(int)`. The initial state of the other variables (`x`, `inds`, `q`, and `i`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is `[0, a[0], 0, a[2], 0, a[4], ..., 0, a[k-1]]` if `k` is odd, or `[0, a[0], 0, a[2], 0, a[4], ..., a[k-1]]` if `k` is even; `inds` is a defaultdict where `inds[0]` is `[0, 2, 4, ..., 2*floor(k/2)]` and `inds[a[j]]` is `[j]` for odd `j`; `q` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`**.
