Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **List `x`:**
   - `x` is constructed such that it contains `0` at even indices and elements from list `a` at odd indices.
   - If `k` (length of `a`) is odd, the last element of `x` is `0`.
   - If `k` is even, the last element of `x` is `a[k-1]`.

2. **Defaultdict `inds`:**
   - `inds[0]` contains a list of all even indices `[0, 2, 4, ..., 2*floor(k/2)]`.
   - For each odd index `j` in `a`, `inds[a[j]]` contains a list with the single element `[j]`.

3. **Variables `q`, `i`, `l`, `r`:**
   - `q` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `l` and `r` are values returned by `func_1(int)`. The exact values of `l` and `r` are not known, but they are indices in the list `x`.

4. **Variables `lower` and `upper`:**
   - `lower` is determined by `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`. This means `lower` is the largest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or the first element of `inds[x[r]]` if no such index exists.
   - `upper` is determined by `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`. This means `upper` is the smallest index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - It is stated that `upper` is not greater than `lower`.

### Print Statement Analysis:

The print statement is:
```python
print('No')
```

### Explanation:

The print statement is a simple print of the string `'No'`. The values of the variables `x`, `inds`, `q`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper` do not affect the output of this statement because the statement itself is hardcoded to print `'No'`.

### Conclusion:

Output: **No**
