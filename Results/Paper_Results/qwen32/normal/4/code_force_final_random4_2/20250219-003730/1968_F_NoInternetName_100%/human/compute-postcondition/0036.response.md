To determine what will be printed by the `print('Yes')` statement, we need to understand the context and the conditions under which the code is executed. Let's break down the given information:

1. **List `x`**: This list alternates between 0 and elements from another list `a` at even indices. The exact structure depends on whether `k` (the length of list `a`) is odd or even.
2. **Dictionary `inds`**: This is a `defaultdict` where:
   - `inds[0]` contains indices of all 0s in list `x`.
   - `inds[a[j]]` contains the index `j` for each odd `j` in list `a`.
3. **Variables `l` and `r`**: These are values returned by the function `func_1(int)`.
4. **Variables `lower` and `upper`**: These are determined based on the values of `l` and `r` and the structure of `inds` and `x`.

The crucial part of the code is the condition that checks whether `upper` is greater than `lower`. If this condition is true, the code prints `'Yes'`.

However, the exact values of `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper` are not provided, and the functions `func_1`, `func_4`, and `func_3` are not defined. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `lower` and `upper`. However, we know that the `print('Yes')` statement will execute if the condition `upper > lower` is true.

Since the problem asks us to provide the most precise description possible based on the given information, we can conclude that the output will be `'Yes'` if the condition `upper > lower` holds true.

Output: **Yes**
