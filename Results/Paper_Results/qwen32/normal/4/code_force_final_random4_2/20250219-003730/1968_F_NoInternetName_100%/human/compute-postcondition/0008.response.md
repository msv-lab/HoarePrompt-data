The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `i` and how it changes during the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
- `a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must have at least one element.
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
- `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, i]`.
- `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0]` and `inds[i]` is `[1]`.

Since `i` is the loop variable, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in the list `a`.

Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `i` was the first element of `a`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the second element of `a`.

State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must have at least one element, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, i]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0]` and `inds[i]` is `[1]`, `i` is the second element of `a`**.
