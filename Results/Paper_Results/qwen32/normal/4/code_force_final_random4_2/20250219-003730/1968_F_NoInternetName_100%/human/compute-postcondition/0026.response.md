Postcondition: **`x` is `[0, a[0], 0, a[2], 0, a[4], ..., 0, a[k-1]]` if `k` is odd, or `[0, a[0], 0, a[2], 0, a[4], ..., a[k-1]]` if `k` is even; `inds` is a defaultdict where `inds[0]` is `[0, 2, 4, ..., 2*floor(k/2)]` and `inds[a[j]]` is `[j]` for odd `j`; `q` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`. Additionally, if `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`, then `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`; `lower` is `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`; `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`; `upper` is not greater than `lower`**
