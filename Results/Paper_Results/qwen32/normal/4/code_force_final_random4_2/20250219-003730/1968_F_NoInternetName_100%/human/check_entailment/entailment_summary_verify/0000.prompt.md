You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function accepts an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and for each of `q` queries, it accepts two integers `l` and `r` representing a range within `a`. It then determines for each query whether there exists an index `i` in the range `[l, r]` such that the XOR of all elements from the start of the list up to `i` is equal to the XOR of all elements from the start up to `r`. The function outputs "Yes" if such an index exists, otherwise "No".+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the logic and verify if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
The problem is to determine if a subarray of an array can be split into `k > 1` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. The program should handle multiple test cases, each with an array and multiple queries.

### Key Points of the Program
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the array and the queries.
2. **XOR Calculation**: It calculates the cumulative XOR for the array and stores it in the list `x`.
3. **Index Mapping**: It uses a dictionary `inds` to map each cumulative XOR value to the list of indices where this value occurs.
4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query `(l, r)`, it first checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]`. If true, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it finds the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the smallest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper > lower`, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Verification of the Program
Let's go through the logic to ensure it meets the problem requirements:

1. **Cumulative XOR Calculation**:
   - `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array.
   - This is correctly computed using `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)`.

2. **Index Mapping**:
   - `inds[x[-1]]` stores the indices where each cumulative XOR value occurs.
   - This is correctly maintained using `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)`.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - The check `if x[l-1] == x[r]` is correct because if the cumulative XOR from the start to `l-1` is the same as from the start to `r`, it means the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` is 0, which can always be split into two parts with equal XOR (e.g., `[a[l]]` and `a[l+1:r+1]`).
   - The logic to find `lower` and `upper` is intended to check if there is any cumulative XOR value `x[r]` that appears before `l` and the corresponding `x[l-1]` that appears after `r`. This ensures that the subarray can be split into two parts with equal XOR.

### Edge Cases
1. **Single Element Subarray**: The program does not handle single-element subarrays, but the problem specifies that `l < r`, so this case is not applicable.
2. **All Elements Same**: If all elements are the same, the cumulative XOR will be the same for all indices, and the program will correctly identify the subarray as interesting.
3. **No Valid Split**: If no valid split exists, the program will correctly identify the subarray as not interesting.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the logic and handling of various cases, the program seems to correctly determine if a subarray can be split into `k > 1` parts with equal XOR for every potential case based on the problem description.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting for all potential cases as per the problem description.
