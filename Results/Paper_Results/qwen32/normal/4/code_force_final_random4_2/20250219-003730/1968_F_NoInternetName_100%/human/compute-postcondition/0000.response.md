The code snippet provided is:
```python
n, q = func_1(int)
```

This line of code suggests that `func_1` is a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns a tuple of two integers, which are then unpacked into the variables `n` and `q`.

Given the initial state, `n` and `q` are integers satisfying specific constraints. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, so the exact values of `n` and `q` after the function call depend on the implementation of `func_1`.

Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is unknown, we can only describe the output state in terms of the function's output. The other variables (`a`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element satisfies 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n.**
