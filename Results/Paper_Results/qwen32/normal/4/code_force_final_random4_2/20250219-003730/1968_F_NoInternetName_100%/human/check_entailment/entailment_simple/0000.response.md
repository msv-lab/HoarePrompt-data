### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to determine if a subarray of a given array can be divided into two or more parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, the array elements, and the queries themselves.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - It calculates the prefix XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - It also maintains a dictionary `inds` that maps each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that XOR value occurs.

3. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, it checks if the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1:r]` can be split into equal parts.
   - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it means the XOR of the subarray is zero, which can always be split into parts with XOR zero.
   - If not, it uses the `inds` dictionary to find the largest index `lower` less than `l` where `x[lower] == x[r]` and the smallest index `upper` greater than or equal to `r` where `x[upper] == x[l-1]`.
   - If `upper > lower`, it means there exists a valid split of the subarray, and it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Prefix XOR Calculation:** The prefix XOR array `x` is correctly calculated, and the dictionary `inds` maps each prefix XOR value to the correct indices. This is crucial for efficiently finding potential splits in the subarrays.
  
- **Query Processing:** The logic for processing each query is sound. The use of binary search (through `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`) ensures that the program finds the correct indices efficiently. The conditions for checking if a subarray can be split into equal XOR parts are correctly implemented.

- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases such as subarrays with XOR zero and subarrays that cannot be split into equal XOR parts.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal bitwise XOR values. The implementation is efficient and handles the constraints provided in the problem statement.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the prefix XOR for each subarray and efficiently uses binary search to determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values. The logic is sound, and the implementation handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.
Correctness: **True**
