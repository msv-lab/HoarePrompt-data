The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially 2, it becomes 3. The values of `t`, `X`, `x`, and `subseq_lens` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is at least 8, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `i` is 3**.
