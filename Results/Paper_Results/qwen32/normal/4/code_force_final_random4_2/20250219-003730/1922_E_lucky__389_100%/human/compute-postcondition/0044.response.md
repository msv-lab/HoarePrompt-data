To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop: `2 ** i <= x`. 

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.
- `x` is at least 4.
- `subseq_lens` is an empty list.
- `i` is 1.
- The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The loop condition is `2 ** i <= x`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `2 ** i` is still less than or equal to `x`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1.

Since the loop condition is `2 ** i <= x`, and `i` is currently 1, the condition becomes `2 ** 1 <= x` or simply `2 <= x`. Given that `x` is at least 4, this condition is satisfied, and the loop can continue.

However, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the next iteration where `i` will be incremented by 1. So, we need to ensure that `2 ** (i + 1) <= x` is true. Given that `i` is currently 1, in the next iteration, `i` will be 2, and the condition will be `2 ** 2 <= x` or `4 <= x`. Since `x` is at least 4, this condition is also satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed to the values of `i` or `x` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is at least 4, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
