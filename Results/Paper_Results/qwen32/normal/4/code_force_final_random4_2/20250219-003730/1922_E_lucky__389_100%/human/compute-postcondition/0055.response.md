Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is at least 4 minus 2^59, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or contains the value 59, `i` is either 0 or 60, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` was 0, `subseq_lens` remains an empty list and `i` becomes 0. If `i` was 60, `subseq_lens` contains the value 59, `x` is at least 4 minus 2^59, `i` remains 60, and `mx` is at least 59.**
