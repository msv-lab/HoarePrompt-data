The given code snippet creates a list `ansv` that contains integers from 0 up to `mx - 1`. The variables `t`, `X`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx` remain unchanged, except for the creation of `ansv`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the powers of 2 subtracted from `X` in descending order, and `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`; `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx - 1`.**
