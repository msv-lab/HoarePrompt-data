### Reasoning:
The given Python program attempts to solve the problem by finding an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Special Case for \( X = 2 \)**:
   - If \( X = 2 \), the program outputs `1` as the length of the array and `0` as the array itself. This is because the array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`.

2. **General Case for \( X > 2 \)**:
   - For \( X > 2 \), the program aims to decompose \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2. This is because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be related to the sum of powers of 2.
   - The program iteratively finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( X \) and subtracts it from \( X \). The exponents of these powers of 2 are stored in the list `subseq_lens`.
   - After decomposing \( X \), the program constructs an array `ansv` that is supposed to have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by first including all integers from `0` to `mx - 1` (where `mx` is the highest exponent found), and then appending the remaining exponents from `subseq_lens` (excluding the first one).

However, there are some issues with the program:
- The logic for constructing the array `ansv` is flawed. The constructed array does not necessarily guarantee that it will have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
- The program does not handle cases where \( X \) cannot be represented as a sum of powers of 2 in a way that results in an array of length at most 200 with the required number of increasing subsequences.

Given the provided examples and the logic in the program, it is clear that the program does not correctly generate an array for all values of \( X \) within the given constraints.
