The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `X`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is a non-zero integer and `x` must be at least 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0 unless the else part is executed, in which case `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `i - 1`, `i` is 1**.
