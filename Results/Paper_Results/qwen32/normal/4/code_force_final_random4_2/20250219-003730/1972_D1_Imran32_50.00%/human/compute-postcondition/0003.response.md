To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `root`. The loop will execute if the range `(2, root + 1)` is not empty, meaning `root` must be at least 2.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop head variables:** `i` and `root`.
2. **Determine the condition for loop execution:** The loop will execute if `root + 1` is greater than 2, which means `root` must be at least 2.
3. **Adjust the state of `root`:** Since `root` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, we need to ensure that `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 1. This means `n` must be at least 1. However, since the problem states that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^6`, `n` will always be at least 1, and thus `root` will always be at least 2.
4. **Adjust the state of `i`:** The loop starts with `i = 2`, so `i` should be initialized to 2 before the loop starts.

Given that `n` and `m` are assigned from the input, and `ans` is assigned the value of `n`, we need to ensure that `root` is calculated correctly based on `n` and `i` is set to 2.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2 · 10^6), `ans` is `n`, `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` (which is at least 2), `i` is 2**
