The code `ans += (n + i) // cnt` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the integer division of `(n + i)` by `cnt` to it. The other variables (`i`, `root`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged in terms of their expressions or states.

Given:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `root` remains unchanged
- `cnt` is `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`

The new value of `ans` will be the previous value of `ans` plus `(n + i) // cnt`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `root` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + i) // cnt`**.
