Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input for a single test case consisting of two positive integers `n` and `k`. It calculates a value `ans` starting from `n` and adds to it the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each `i` from `2` to the square root of `n` rounded up. The result is then printed.**
