You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The provided code does not implement the logic to check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b))\). Instead, it appears to be implementing a different logic related to counting divisors, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.

Let's consider a simple example to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- For \((a, b) = (1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\), and \(2 \mod 1 = 0\). Valid.
- For \((a, b) = (1, 2)\): \(1 + 2 = 3\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2\), and \(3 \mod 2 \neq 0\). Invalid.
- For \((a, b) = (1, 3)\): \(1 + 3 = 4\) and \(3 \cdot \gcd(1, 3) = 3\), and \(4 \mod 3 \neq 0\). Invalid.
- For \((a, b) = (2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\), and \(3 \mod 1 = 0\). Valid.
- For \((a, b) = (2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\), and \(4 \mod 2 = 0\). Valid.
- For \((a, b) = (2, 3)\): \(2 + 3 = 5\) and \(3 \cdot \gcd(2, 3) = 3\), and \(5 \mod 3 \neq 0\). Invalid.

So, the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\), resulting in 3 valid pairs.

**Output of Provided Program:**
The provided program does not produce the correct output for this input. It seems to be counting something else entirely.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
