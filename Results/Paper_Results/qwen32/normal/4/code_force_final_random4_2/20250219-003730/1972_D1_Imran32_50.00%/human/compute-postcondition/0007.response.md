The code snippet assigns the value of `i * i` to the variable `cnt`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is `i + 1`, which implies that `i` has been incremented by 1 before this assignment. The value of `root` remains unchanged.

Thus, the value of `cnt` will be `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `root` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`**.
