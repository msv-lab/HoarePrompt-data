Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers from the input, with `k` being greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`; `ans1` is `ans1 + a[i] - a[i + x] * 2`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting twice the value of the element at index `i + x` in the list `a` from its current value, which was previously increased by the value of the element at index `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged as per the given initial state.
