Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are as initially described.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
    ans1 = sum(a)
    for i in range(x):
        ans1 -= a[i] * 2
    ans2 = ans1
    for i in range(k):
        ans1 += a[i]
        if i + x < n:
            ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
        ans = max(ans1, ans2)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` minus twice the sum of the elements from index `x` to `x + k - 1` of `a` (if those indices are within bounds). `ans2` remains unchanged and `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` minus twice the sum of the elements starting from index `x` up to `x + k - 1` (if they exist); `ans2` is the value of `ans1` after `k-1` iterations; `ans` is the maximum of the final `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus the sum of `a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` minus `2 * a[i + x]` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` if `i + x < n`; `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`; `ans` is the maximum of the final `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input; `t` is decremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
