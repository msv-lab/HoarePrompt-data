Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers from the input, with `k` being greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order; `i` is incremented by 1. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]` plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2`; otherwise, `ans1` remains the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]` plus `a[i]`. `ans2` remains the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`. `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.**
