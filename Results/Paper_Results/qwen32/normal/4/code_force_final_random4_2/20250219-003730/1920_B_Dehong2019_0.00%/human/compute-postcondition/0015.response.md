The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` increases the value of `ans1` by the value of the `i`-th element of the list `a`. Given the initial state, `ans1` is initially set to the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`. After executing the code, `ans1` is incremented by `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input split as integers with `k` being greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]`; `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`**.
