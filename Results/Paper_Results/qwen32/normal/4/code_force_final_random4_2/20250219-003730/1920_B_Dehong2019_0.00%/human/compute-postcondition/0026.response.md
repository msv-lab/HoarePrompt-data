Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers from the input, with `k` being greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`; `ans1` is `ans1 + a[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state indicates that the value of `ans1` has been updated by adding the element at index `i` of the list `a` to it. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. All other initial conditions still hold true.
