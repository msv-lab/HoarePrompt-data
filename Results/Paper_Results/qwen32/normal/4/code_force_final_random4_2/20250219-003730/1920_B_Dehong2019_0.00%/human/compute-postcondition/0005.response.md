Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input split as integers; `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a`.**

In this output state, the variable `ans1` has been calculated as the sum of all elements in the list `a`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a`) retain their initial values and conditions.
