The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given that `a` is sorted in descending order and `i` is 1, `a[i]` refers to the second largest element in `a`.

The initial value of `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the largest element in `a`. After executing the code, `ans1` will be reduced by twice the second largest element in `a`.

Output State: **`a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the largest element in `a` minus twice the second largest element in `a`; `ans2` remains unchanged; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input; `x` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1.**
