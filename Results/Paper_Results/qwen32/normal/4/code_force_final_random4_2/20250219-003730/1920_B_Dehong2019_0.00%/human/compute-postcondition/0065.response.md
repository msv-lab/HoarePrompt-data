The code snippet `ans1 = sum(a)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `ans1`. The other variables (`ans2`, `ans`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `t`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a`; `ans2` is the value of `ans1` after `k-1` iterations; `ans` is the maximum of the final `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input; `t` is decremented by 1.**
