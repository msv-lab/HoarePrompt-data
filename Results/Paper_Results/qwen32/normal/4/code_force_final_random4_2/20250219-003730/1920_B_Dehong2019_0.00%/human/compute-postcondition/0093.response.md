Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a value for each test case. Specifically, if a certain condition based on `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` is met, it returns one value; otherwise, it returns a different value.**
