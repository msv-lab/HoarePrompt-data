The code snippet `count[num] -= 1` decrements the value associated with the key `num` in the `count` dictionary by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `count[num]` is decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_j < 2^31 for each `j`, `res` is 0, and `count` is a dictionary where the value associated with the key `num` has been decremented by 1.**
