Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is the binary string input by the user, `k` is 0, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[i]` if such an index exists and is less than `m`; otherwise, `j` is `m`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is less than `m`.**
