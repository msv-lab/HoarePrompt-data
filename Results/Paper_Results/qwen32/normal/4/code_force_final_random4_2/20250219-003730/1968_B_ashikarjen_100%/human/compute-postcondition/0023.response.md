The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `a`, `m`, `b`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is the binary string input by the user with `b[1] != a[0]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `b[0] != a[0]`**.
