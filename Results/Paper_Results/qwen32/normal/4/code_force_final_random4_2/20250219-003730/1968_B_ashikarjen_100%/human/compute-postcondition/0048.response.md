To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand the variables involved.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable is not directly used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `a` is a binary string of length `n`. This string contains only '0's and '1's.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5. This variable represents the length of the binary string `b`.
- `b` is the binary string input by the user, and its length is `m`.
- `k` is the number of characters from `a` that were found in `b` in order. This means that `k` counts how many characters from `a` appear in `b` in the same sequence as they appear in `a`, but not necessarily consecutively.
- `j` is the position in `b` just after the last found character from `a` or `m` if the loop broke early. This variable is not directly used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `i` is equal to `n` if the loop completes all iterations, or the index at which the loop broke. This variable is not directly used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.

Given the context, the print statement `print(k)` will output the value of `k`, which is the number of characters from `a` that were found in `b` in order. Since we do not have the specific values of `a` and `b`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `k`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

Output: **k (where k is the number of characters from `a` that were found in `b` in order)**
