To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables.

The loop iterates from `temp` to `n-1` with the step of 1. In each iteration, it appends the value `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to the list `ans`.

Given the initial state and the states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue until `i` reaches `n-1`. Therefore, the loop will execute `n - temp` times in total.

After all iterations, the variable `ans` will include the values `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` in the range from `temp` to `n-1`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `temp`) remain unchanged throughout the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `temp` is an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n; `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes, and now includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` in the range from `temp` to `n-1`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, the list `ans` will contain the absolute differences between elements of `a` starting from index `temp` and corresponding elements of `b` starting from the end, up to the length of `a`. All other variables remain in their initial state.
