Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. a_i is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. b_i is a list of m integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    temp = -1
    ans = []
    a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
    b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
    for i in range(n):
        if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
            temp = i
            break
        ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
    if temp != -1:
        for i in range(temp, n):
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
    print(sum(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `temp` is either -1 or an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes, and includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` in the range from `temp` to `n-1`. If `temp` is -1, `ans` contains the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes. `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. `n` remains the first integer from the input. `m` remains the second integer from the input. `temp` remains the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, or -1 if never met. `ans` contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n - 1` if `temp` is not -1, otherwise `ans` contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n - 1`. `a` remains the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input. `b` remains the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order. `i` will have reached `n` after the loop completes.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is either -1 or an integer less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements if `temp` is -1, or `2n - temp` elements if `temp` is less than `n`, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, and `i` is `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
