### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the program and the problem statement to determine if the provided program is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) where \( c_i \) is a permutation of \( n \) chosen integers from \( b_i \). To maximize this difference, for each element in \( a \), we should ideally pair it with either the smallest or the largest possible element from \( b \) to maximize the absolute difference.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
   - The program sorts the array `b` in descending order.

2. **Pairing Strategy**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the absolute differences.
   - It then iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and `b` to find the optimal pairing based on the absolute difference.
   - It checks whether pairing `a[i]` with the largest remaining element of `b` (i.e., `b[-(n - i)]`) results in a larger absolute difference than pairing with the current element of `b` (i.e., `b[i]`).
   - If a better pairing is found, it switches to pairing the remaining elements of `a` with the largest remaining elements of `b` from that point onwards.

3. **Summing Differences**:
   - Finally, it sums up the absolute differences stored in `ans` and prints the result.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly implement the strategy to maximize the total difference. It only checks for a single point where switching the pairing strategy might yield a better result, but it does not ensure that the overall strategy is optimal.
- The logic for switching the pairing strategy is flawed. It only switches once if it finds a better pairing, but it should consider the overall effect of pairing the smallest and largest elements from `b` with elements of `a` to maximize the difference.
- The program does not consider all possible pairings to ensure the maximum difference, which is crucial for solving the problem correctly.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we should:
- Pair the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `b`.
- Pair the second smallest element of `a` with the second largest element of `b`.
- Continue this process until all elements of `a` are paired.

This ensures that we are maximizing the absolute differences for each element in `a`.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the strategy to maximize the total difference \( D \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
