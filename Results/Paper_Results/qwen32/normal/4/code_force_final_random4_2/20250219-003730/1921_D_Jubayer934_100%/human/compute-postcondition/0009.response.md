The `break` statement will terminate the loop or block it is in, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `temp`, `ans`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is still true, but it does not influence the variables' values directly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `temp` is `i`; `ans` is an empty list; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is true.**
