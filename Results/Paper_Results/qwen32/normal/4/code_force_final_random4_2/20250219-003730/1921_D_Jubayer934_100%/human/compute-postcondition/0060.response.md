The code appends a new value to the list `ans`. The new value is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`. The value of `i` is `temp + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, and `temp` is not -1, and `temp` is less than `n`.
- `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations, plus the new value `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)])`.
- `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
- `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.
- `i` is `temp + 1`.

After the execution of `ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))`, the list `ans` will include an additional element, which is `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, and `temp` is not -1, and `temp` is less than `n`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations, plus the new value `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)])` and `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `temp + 1`.**
