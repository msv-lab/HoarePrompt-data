Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is either -1 or an integer less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements if `temp` is -1, or `2n - temp` elements if `temp` is less than `n`, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, and `i` is `n`.**
