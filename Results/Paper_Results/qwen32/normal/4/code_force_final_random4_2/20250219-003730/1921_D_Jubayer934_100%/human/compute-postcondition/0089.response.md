Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is not equal to -1 (indicating the loop broke early), `ans` is a list containing `n` elements `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, and `i` is `n`.**
