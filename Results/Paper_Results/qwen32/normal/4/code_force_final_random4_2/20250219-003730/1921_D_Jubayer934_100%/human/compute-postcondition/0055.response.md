To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how the variables `temp` and `ans` are updated.

The loop iterates over the range of `n`, and for each iteration `i`:
- It checks if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- If the condition is true, it sets `temp` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
- If the condition is false, it appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`.

The loop will continue until either the condition is met and `temp` is set, or it has iterated through all `n` elements.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are input parameters.
- `temp` will be set to the index `i` where the condition is first met, or it will remain `-1` if the condition is never met.
- `ans` will contain the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations.
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are initialized from the input and not modified within the loop.

The final output state can be described as follows:
- If the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is met at any point, `temp` will be set to that index `i`, and `ans` will contain the absolute differences up to that point.
- If the condition is never met, `temp` will remain `-1`, and `ans` will contain the absolute differences for all `n` elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, or -1 if never met; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.**
