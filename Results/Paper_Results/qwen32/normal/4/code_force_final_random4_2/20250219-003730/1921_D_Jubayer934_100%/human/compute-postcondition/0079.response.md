Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is 1, `ans` is a list containing one element `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, and `i` is 1**.

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to 1, while all other variables retain their initial values or states.
