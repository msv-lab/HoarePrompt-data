### Reasoning:

The goal of the program is to maximize the total difference \( D \) between Petya's array \( a \) and Vasya's array \( c \), where \( c \) is formed by choosing \( n \) integers from Vasya's array \( b \) and arranging them in a certain order.

The approach taken by the program is as follows:
1. For each test case, it reads the integers \( n \) and \( m \).
2. It reads the arrays \( a \) and \( b \).
3. It sorts \( a \) in ascending order and \( b \) in descending order.
4. It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the absolute differences and a variable `temp` to -1.
5. It iterates through the first \( n \) elements of the sorted \( a \) and \( b \), comparing the differences between corresponding elements of \( a \) and the smallest remaining element of \( b \) (from the end of the sorted \( b \)) versus the largest remaining element of \( b \) (from the start of the sorted \( b \)).
6. If the difference with the smallest remaining element of \( b \) is larger, it sets `temp` to the current index and breaks out of the loop.
7. If the loop completes without breaking, it means the differences with the largest elements of \( b \) were always larger, and it appends these differences to `ans`.
8. If the loop breaks, it means the differences with the smallest elements of \( b \) were larger for some elements, and it appends the appropriate differences to `ans`.
9. Finally, it prints the sum of the differences in `ans`.

The logic is sound because:
- Sorting \( a \) in ascending order and \( b \) in descending order ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first.
- The comparison of differences helps in deciding whether to use the smallest or largest elements of \( b \) to maximize \( D \).
- The use of `temp` ensures that the optimal choice is made for each element of \( a \).

### Correctness: **True**
