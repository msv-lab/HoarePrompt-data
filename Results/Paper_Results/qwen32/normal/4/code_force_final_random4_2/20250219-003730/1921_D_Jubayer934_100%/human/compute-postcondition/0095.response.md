The code snippet appends a new element to the `ans` list. This new element is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `temp` is an integer less than `n`.
- `ans` is a list containing `n+2` elements where the last two elements are `abs(a[n-1] - b[0])` and `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`.
- `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
- `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.
- `i` is `temp + 1`.

After the code executes:
- The `ans` list will now have `n+3` elements, with the newly appended element being `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is an integer less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n+3` elements where the last element is `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, and `i` is `temp + 1`.**
