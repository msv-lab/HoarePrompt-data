Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, and `temp` is not -1, and `temp` is less than `n`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations, plus the new value `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)])`, `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])`, and `abs(a[temp + 2] - b[-(n - (temp + 2))])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `temp + 3`**

In simpler terms: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and a new absolute difference `abs(a[temp + 2] - b[-(n - (temp + 2))])` has been appended to the list `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
