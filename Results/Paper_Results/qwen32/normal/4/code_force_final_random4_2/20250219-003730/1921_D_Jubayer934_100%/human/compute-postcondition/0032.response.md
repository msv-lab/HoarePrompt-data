To determine the output, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `m` is an integer obtained from the input.
- `temp` is either -1 or an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n.
- `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
- `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.
- `ans` is constructed based on the value of `temp`:
  - If `temp` is not -1, `ans` contains:
    - The values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from 0 up to `temp - 1`.
    - The values `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`.
  - If `temp` is -1, `ans` contains the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from 0 up to `n-1`.

### Code Execution:
The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(sum(ans))
```

### Analysis:
- `ans` is a list of absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b`.
- The sum of `ans` will be the sum of these absolute differences.

### Output:
The output will be the sum of the absolute differences calculated and stored in the list `ans` based on the conditions described.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `temp` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the sum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum of the absolute differences.

Output: **sum(ans) (where ans is a list containing the absolute differences calculated based on the conditions described)**
