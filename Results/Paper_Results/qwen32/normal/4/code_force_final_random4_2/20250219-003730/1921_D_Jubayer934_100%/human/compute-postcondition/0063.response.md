To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to follow the logic of the loop and the given initial and intermediate states.

The loop runs from `i = temp` to `i = n - 1`, appending the absolute difference `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to the list `ans` in each iteration. The loop will continue until `i` reaches `n`.

Given the initial and intermediate states, we know that the loop has already executed 3 times, and the next iterations will continue until `i` reaches `n`.

**Output State:**
- `t` remains the same integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- `m` remains the second integer from the input.
- `temp` remains the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, and `temp` is not -1.
- `ans` will contain the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n - 1`. Specifically, it will include `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)])`, `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])`, `abs(a[temp + 2] - b[-(n - (temp + 2))])`, and so on, up to `abs(a[n - 1] - b[-(n - (n - 1))])`.
- `a` remains the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
- `b` remains the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.
- `i` will have reached `n` after the loop completes.

In simpler terms, the final output state will have the list `ans` fully populated with the absolute differences calculated for each index from `temp` to `n - 1`, and the loop variable `i` will have incremented to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, and `temp` is not -1; `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n - 1`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `n`.**
