Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each of the `t` test cases, the following holds: `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer such that `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, and `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order. The variable `temp` is either -1 or an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes, and includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` in the range from `temp` to `n-1`. If `temp` is -1, `ans` contains the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes. The final output for each test case is the sum of the elements in `ans`.**

In simpler terms: After all the iterations, the loop has processed `t` test cases. For each test case, it calculates the minimum sum of absolute differences between elements of two lists `a` and `b`, following the specified logic, and prints the result. The state of variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `temp`, and `ans` is as described for each test case, and the output for each test case is the sum of the absolute differences as determined by the loop logic.
