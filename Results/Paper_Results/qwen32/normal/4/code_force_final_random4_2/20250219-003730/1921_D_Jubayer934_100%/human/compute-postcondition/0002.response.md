Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `temp` is -1.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been set to -1, while the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged as described in the initial state.
