To determine the state adjustments needed for the given for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and the range parameters `1` and `n - 1`.

Here's the for loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range `range(1, n - 1)` is non-empty. This happens when `1 < n - 1`, which simplifies to `n > 2`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the length of `s`
- `arr` is the newly read list of integers
- `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order
- `ans` is 1
- The number of iterations left is `t-1`
- `n` is not equal to 2

The only state we need to adjust is `n` to ensure that the range `range(1, n - 1)` is non-empty. Since `n` is not equal to 2, it must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is the newly read list of integers, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 1, the number of iterations left is `t-1`**
