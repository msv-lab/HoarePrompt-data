The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended, and `i` is 3.**
