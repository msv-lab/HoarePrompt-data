The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list with `0` as the first element, followed by all unique elements from `arr`. If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 if `n-2` is even, and `ans` is 0 if `n-2` is odd.**
