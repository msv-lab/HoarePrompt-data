The code snippet `s.sort()` sorts the list `s` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr`.**
