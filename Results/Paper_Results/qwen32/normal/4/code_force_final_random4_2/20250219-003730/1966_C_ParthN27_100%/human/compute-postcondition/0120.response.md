Output State: **All test cases have been processed, and the appropriate winner (Alice or Bob) has been printed for each test case.**

In natural language: After all iterations are complete, the loop has processed each of the `t` test cases. For each test case, it determined the winner of a game based on the number of unique stone piles and the differences between their sorted counts. If the number of unique pile sizes (excluding the prepended `0`) is 2, Alice wins. Otherwise, Alice wins if the number of unique pile sizes minus two is even, and Bob wins if it is odd. The results for each test case have been printed accordingly.
