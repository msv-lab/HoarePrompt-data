The value of `n` is assigned the value of the integer input provided. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and this condition remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer.**
