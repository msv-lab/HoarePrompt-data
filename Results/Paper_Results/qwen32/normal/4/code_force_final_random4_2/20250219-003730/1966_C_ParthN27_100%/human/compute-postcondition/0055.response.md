The code snippet `n = len(s)` updates the value of `n` to be the length of the list `s`. The other variables (`t`, `arr`, `s`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of the sorted list `s` with `0` prepended, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended, `ans` is 1.**
