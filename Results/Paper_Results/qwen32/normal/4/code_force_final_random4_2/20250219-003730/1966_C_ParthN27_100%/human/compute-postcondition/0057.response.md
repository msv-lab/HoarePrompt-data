Let's analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State Analysis

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `t` represents the number of test cases, but it does not affect the current `print` statement directly.

2. **`n`**: The length of the sorted list `s` with `0` prepended, and `n` equals 2.
   - This means `s` has exactly two elements: `0` and one other unique element.

3. **`arr`**: A list of integers read from the input.
   - The exact elements of `arr` are not specified, but they will be used to create `s`.

4. **`s`**: A sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended and has exactly one unique element (besides the prepended `0`).
   - This means `s` will look like `[0, unique_element]`.

5. **`ans`**: An integer initialized to 1.
   - `ans` is not used in the current `print` statement.

### Print Statement Analysis

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Output Determination

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Alice'`. None of the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, or `ans` are used in this statement, so their values do not affect the output.

### Final Output

Output: **Alice**
