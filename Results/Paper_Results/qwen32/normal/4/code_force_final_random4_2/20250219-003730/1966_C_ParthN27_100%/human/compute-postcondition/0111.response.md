The code snippet provided is `ans ^= 1`, which toggles the value of `ans` using the XOR operator. If `ans` is `0`, it will become `1`, and if `ans` is `1`, it will become `0`.

Given the initial state, the only change will be in the value of `ans`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, the number of iterations left, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is the newly read list of integers, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, the number of iterations left is `t-1`, `i` is `i_end + 2` where `i_end + 2` must be less than `n-1`. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` is toggled by XOR with 1; `ans` is toggled to `1 - ans`.**
