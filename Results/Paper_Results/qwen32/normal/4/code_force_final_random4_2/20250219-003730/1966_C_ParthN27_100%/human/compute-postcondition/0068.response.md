Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended, and `i` is 2. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` is flipped (if `ans` was 0, it is now 1; if `ans` was 1, it is now 0).**
