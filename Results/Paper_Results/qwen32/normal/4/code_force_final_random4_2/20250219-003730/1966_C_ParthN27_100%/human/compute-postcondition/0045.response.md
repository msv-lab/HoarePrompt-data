The code snippet `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `ans` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `s` is an empty set. After adding `arr[i]` to `s`, `s` will contain the element `arr[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `ans` remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a set containing `arr[i]`, and `ans` is 1 if `n` is 2, or 1 if `n-2` is even, and 0 if `n-2` is odd**.
