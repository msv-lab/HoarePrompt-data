The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i_end + 1` and `i_end + 1` must be less than `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `n` should remain the same since it is the length of the list `s` and does not change within the loop.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_end + 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 2`. The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is the newly read list of integers, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, the number of iterations left is `t-1`, `i` is `i_end + 2` where `i_end + 2` must be less than `n-1`. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` is toggled by XOR with 1.**
