Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended. If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0.**
