To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to analyze the logic used to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, which happens when the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
2. **XOR properties**:
   - XOR of an even number of identical numbers is zero.
   - XOR of an odd number of identical numbers is the number itself.
   - XOR of different numbers can vary based on their binary representation.
3. **Eve's strategy**:
   - Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins, which means maximizing the number of times the XOR of the sequence becomes zero.
4. **Key Insight**:
   - If there are an even number of each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4), removing pairs will keep the XOR zero.
   - If there is an odd number of any type, removing pairs will leave one number, and the final XOR can be zero only if all remaining numbers are paired or removed optimally.

### Program Analysis:
- The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by summing up the integer division of each count by 2 (`a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`), which represents the pairs that can be removed.
- It then adds 1 if all four counts modulo 2 sum to 3 (`int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`), which is a special condition that allows Bob to win one more time by leaving a single number with a specific parity.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: `1 1 1 0`
  - Pairs: 0 (since there's only one of each)
  - Special condition: `1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 0 % 2 = 3`, so add 1.
  - Result: 1 (Bob wins once).
- **Test Case 2**: `1 0 1 2`
  - Pairs: 1 (one pair of 2s)
  - Special condition: `1 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 2 % 2 = 2`, so no additional win.
  - Result: 1 (Bob wins once).
- **Test Case 3**: `2 2 2 0`
  - Pairs: 3 (two pairs of 2s, one of 2s)
  - Special condition: `2 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 0 % 2 = 0`, so no additional win.
  - Result: 3 (Bob wins three times).
- **Test Case 4**: `3 3 2 0`
  - Pairs: 4 (one pair of 3s, one pair of 3s, one pair of 2s)
  - Special condition: `3 % 2 + 3 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 0 % 2 = 3`, so add 1.
  - Result: 4 (Bob wins four times).
- **Test Case 5**: `0 9 9 9`
  - Pairs: 12 (four pairs of 9s)
  - Special condition: `0 % 2 + 9 % 2 + 9 % 2 + 9 % 2 = 3`, so add 1.
  - Result: 13 (Bob wins thirteen times).

### Conclusion:
The program logic seems correct based on the problem analysis and the provided examples. The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering both the pairs and the special condition.

Correctness: **True**
