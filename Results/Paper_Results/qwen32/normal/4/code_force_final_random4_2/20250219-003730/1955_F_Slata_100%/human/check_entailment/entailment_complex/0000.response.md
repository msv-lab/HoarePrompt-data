To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze the logic behind the solution and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:

The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally. Bob wins if the XOR of all remaining numbers is 0. XOR of a sequence of numbers is 0 if and only if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even. 

Given the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can represent them in binary:
- 1 = 01
- 2 = 10
- 3 = 11
- 4 = 100

For Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be 0. This means the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s must be such that the XOR of the sequence is 0.

### Key Observations:
1. **Count of 1s and 3s**: XOR of 1 and 3 is 2 (11 XOR 01 = 10). So, if we have an even number of 1s and 3s, their XOR will be 0.
2. **Count of 2s and 4s**: XOR of 2 and 4 is 6 (10 XOR 100 = 110). So, if we have an even number of 2s and 4s, their XOR will be 0.
3. **Overall XOR**: The overall XOR will be 0 if the counts of 1s and 3s are even and the counts of 2s and 4s are even.

### Strategy for Eve to Maximize Bob's Wins:
Eve should aim to remove numbers such that the remaining numbers have even counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s as many times as possible. 

### Calculation:
- For each count `x` of a number (1, 2, 3, or 4), the number of times Eve can remove numbers to make the count even is `x // 2`.
- Additionally, if the sum of the remainders when each count is divided by 2 equals 3 (i.e., one count is odd and the other three are odd), then one more game can be won by Bob.

### Program Analysis:
The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by summing up `x // 2` for each count `x` and adding 1 if the sum of the remainders is 3.

Let's verify the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: `1 1 1 0`
   - `1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 0`
   - `1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 0 % 2 = 3`
   - Result: `0 + 1 = 1`
   - Correct.

2. **Example 2**: `1 0 1 2`
   - `1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 2 // 2 = 1`
   - `1 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 2 % 2 = 2`
   - Result: `1 + 0 = 1`
   - Correct.

3. **Example 3**: `2 2 2 0`
   - `2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 3`
   - `2 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 0 % 2 = 0`
   - Result: `3 + 0 = 3`
   - Correct.

4. **Example 4**: `3 3 2 0`
   - `3 // 2 + 3 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 3`
   - `3 % 2 + 3 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 0 % 2 = 2`
   - Result: `3 + 0 = 3`
   - Correct.

5. **Example 5**: `0 9 9 9`
   - `0 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 = 12`
   - `0 % 2 + 9 % 2 + 9 % 2 + 9 % 2 = 3`
   - Result: `12 + 1 = 13`
   - Correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

**Correctness: True**
