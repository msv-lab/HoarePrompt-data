You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of four integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
        
    #State: a sequence of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for one test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze if it correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice, given the optimal strategy of Eve in removing numbers from the sequence.

### Problem Analysis

The game revolves around the XOR operation. Alice wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is non-zero, and Bob wins if the XOR is zero. To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to leave an even number of each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4) because the XOR of an even number of identical numbers is zero.

### Key Observations

1. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of an even number of identical numbers is zero.
   - XOR of an odd number of 1s is 1.
   - XOR of an odd number of 2s is 2.
   - XOR of an odd number of 3s is 3.
   - XOR of an odd number of 4s is 4.
   - XOR of a mix of numbers will be non-zero if the count of any number type is odd.

2. **Game Strategy**:
   - Eve's goal is to maximize the number of times the XOR is zero.
   - This can be achieved by ensuring that after removing a number, the count of each number type remains even as much as possible.

### Program Analysis

The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the following:
- For each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4), it calculates how many pairs (even numbers) can be formed (`a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`).
- It then checks if there is an odd count of all four numbers (`a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3`). If true, it adds 1 to the count, which accounts for the scenario where the last remaining numbers are one of each type (1, 2, 3), making the XOR zero.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Calculation: `1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Bob wins once when all numbers are removed)

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Calculation: `1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 2 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Bob wins once by removing one 1 and one 3)

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Calculation: `2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(2 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3`
   - Output: `3` (Bob wins three times by leaving pairs of numbers)

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Calculation: `3 // 2 + 3 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(3 % 2 + 3 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 4`
   - Output: `3` (Bob wins three times by leaving pairs of numbers, with the last removal making the XOR zero)

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Calculation: `0 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + int(0 % 2 + 9 % 2 + 9 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13`
   - Output: `12` (Bob wins twelve times by leaving pairs of numbers)

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice by considering the optimal strategy of Eve in removing numbers. Therefore, the program is correct.
