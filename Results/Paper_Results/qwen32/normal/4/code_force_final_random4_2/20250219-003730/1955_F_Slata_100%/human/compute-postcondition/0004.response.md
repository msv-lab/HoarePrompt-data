The code snippet `a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into four parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The initial state of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` as the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence is overwritten by the new input values. The variable `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence as provided by the input; `i` is 3.**
