The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it is controlled by the `range(int(input()))` statement. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` accordingly. The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, `i` is `x + 1`**.

However, since we do not know the exact value of `x` (as it depends on the previous iterations and the input), we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, `i` is incremented by 1**. 

If we need a concrete example, we can assume `i` was 0 at the start of the first iteration, so at the start of the second iteration, `i` would be 1. But without loss of generality, we can just say `i` is incremented by 1.

State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, `i` is incremented by 1**.

For clarity, if we assume `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, `i` is 3**.

But sticking to the general case:

State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, `i` is incremented by 1**.

For the sake of providing a specific state, let's assume `i` was 2:

State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, `i` is 3**.
