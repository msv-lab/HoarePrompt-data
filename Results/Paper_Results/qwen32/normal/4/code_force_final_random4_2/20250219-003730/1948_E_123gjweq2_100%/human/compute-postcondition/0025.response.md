Functionality: **The function `make_array` modifies two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, based on the input parameters `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It fills a segment of `arr` from index `left` to `right` with a sequence of numbers starting from `left + 1` up to `right + 1`, with the first half in ascending order and the second half in descending order. Simultaneously, it assigns the value of `clique` to the corresponding elements in the `cliquess` list from index `left` to `right`.**
