To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the array `arr` and the list `cliquess`.

The loop iterates `mid` times, where `mid` is calculated as `(right - left + 1) // 2`. During each iteration `i`, the loop performs the following operations:
1. `arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i`
2. `cliquess[left + i] = clique`

Let's break down the loop's behavior:

- `small_element` is initialized as `left + 1`.
- The loop runs `mid` times, so `i` ranges from `0` to `mid - 1`.
- For each `i`, the element at index `left + mid - i - 1` in the array `arr` is set to `small_element + i`.
- Simultaneously, the element at index `left + i` in the list `cliquess` is set to `clique`.

After the loop completes, the following will be true:
- The first `mid` elements of `cliquess` starting from index `left` will all be set to `clique`.
- The last `mid` elements of `arr` starting from index `left` will be set to values starting from `small_element` and incrementing by 1 up to `small_element + mid - 1`.

Given that the loop runs `mid` times, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is \((\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) // 2\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `(left + 1) + i` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid - 1\), `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid - 1\).**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes:
- The first `mid` elements of `cliquess` starting from index `left` are all set to the current `clique` number.
- The last `mid` elements of `arr` starting from index `left` are filled with consecutive integers starting from `left + 1` up to `left + mid`.
