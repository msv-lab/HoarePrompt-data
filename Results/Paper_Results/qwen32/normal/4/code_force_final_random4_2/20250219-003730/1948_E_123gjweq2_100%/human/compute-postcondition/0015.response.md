Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is \((\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) // 2\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `(left + 1) + i` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid - 1\), `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid - 1\), `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for \(i = 0\) to `not_mid - 1`**.

In simple terms, the values of `arr` from index `left + mid` to `right` have been updated. Specifically, `arr[left + mid]` is now `big_element`, `arr[left + mid + 1]` is `big_element - 1`, and so on, up to `arr[right]` which is `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
