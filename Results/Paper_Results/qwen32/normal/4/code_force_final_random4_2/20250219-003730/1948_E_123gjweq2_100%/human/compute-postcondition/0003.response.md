The code calculates `not_mid` as `right - left + 1 - mid`. Given the initial state, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, so `not_mid` can be simplified as:

`not_mid = right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2`

This means `not_mid` is the remaining count of elements after accounting for the middle element(s).

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`.**
