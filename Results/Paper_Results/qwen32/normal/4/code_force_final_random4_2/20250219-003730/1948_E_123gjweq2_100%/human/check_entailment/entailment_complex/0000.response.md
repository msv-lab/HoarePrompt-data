### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the solution step-by-step to determine if the given program is correct.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to vertices numbered from 1 to n.
   - An edge is added between vertices i and j if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k.
   - We need to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques, where each vertex belongs to exactly one clique, and all vertices in a clique are connected.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The program calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two lists: `arr` and `cliquess`.
   - The `func_1` function iterates over the number of cliques and calls `make_array` for each segment of the array.
   - The `make_array` function fills segments of `arr` with ascending and descending sequences and assigns the same clique number to the corresponding elements in `cliquess`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, which means we are dividing the n vertices into segments of size k (or less for the last segment).
   - Each segment is filled with a sequence of numbers from `left + 1` to `right + 1` in ascending order up to the midpoint and then in descending order.
   - The corresponding elements in `cliquess` are assigned the same clique number.

4. **Evaluating the Output:**
   - The output includes the list of assigned integers (`arr`), the number of cliques, and the partition of the graph into cliques (`cliquess`).
   - The provided example outputs seem to follow the logic described above, but we need to verify if the graph formed by these assignments can indeed be partitioned into the specified number of cliques.

5. **Verification Against Example:**
   - For the first example (n=2, k=3):
     - The output is `2 1`, `1`, and `1 1`.
     - Assignments: `arr = [2, 1]` and `cliquess = [1, 1]`.
     - The graph has vertices 1 and 2. |1 - 2| + |2 - 1| = 2 ≤ 3, so there is an edge between them.
     - Both vertices are in the same clique, which is correct.
   - For the second example (n=5, k=4):
     - The output is `3 1 5 2 4`, `2`, and `1 1 2 1 2`.
     - Assignments: `arr = [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]` and `cliquess = [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]`.
     - The graph has vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The edges are formed based on the condition |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ 4.
     - The partition into cliques seems correct.
   - For the third example (n=8, k=16):
     - The output is `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8`, `1`, and `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`.
     - Assignments: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` and `cliquess = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
     - The graph has vertices 1 to 8. Since k=16, all pairs of vertices will have an edge between them.
     - All vertices are in the same clique, which is correct.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided solution seems to follow the logic correctly and produces outputs that satisfy the conditions of the problem for the given examples.
   - However, the detailed verification of all possible cases and edge conditions is not feasible manually here, but based on the provided examples, the program appears to be correct.
