You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1. There is at least one a_i equal to 1 in each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        print(a)
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: After all the iterations of the loop, `t` will be 0, `n` will be the last input integer, `a` will be the last processed list with leading and trailing zeros removed, and `res` will be the count of zeros in the last processed list `a`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Moves:**
   - The program simply counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in the trimmed list of cells (after removing leading and trailing zeros). This does not account for the actual minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together into a contiguous block.
   
2. **Trimming the List:**
   - The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list. While this might simplify the problem, it does not correctly reflect the number of moves needed to bring the chips together.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
6
0 0 1 0 1 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The chips are at positions 3 and 5.
- To move the chips into a single block, you can move the chip from position 5 to position 4, and then move the chip from position 3 to position 2. This requires 2 moves.

**Program Output:**
- The program will count the number of zeros in the trimmed list `[1 0 1]`, which is 1. This is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, you need to calculate the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together. One way to do this is to calculate the cost of moving all chips to the median position of the chips. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        positions = [i for i in range(n) if a[i] == 1]
        median = positions[len(positions) // 2]
        moves = sum(abs(p - median) for p in positions)
        print(moves)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In this corrected version, the program identifies the positions of all chips, calculates the median position, and then calculates the total number of moves required to bring all chips to this median position. This approach ensures that the chips are moved into a single block with the minimum number of operations.
