The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the initial state of `a` is `[0]`, after executing `a.pop()`, the list `a` will be empty. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `res` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is [], `res` is 0**.
