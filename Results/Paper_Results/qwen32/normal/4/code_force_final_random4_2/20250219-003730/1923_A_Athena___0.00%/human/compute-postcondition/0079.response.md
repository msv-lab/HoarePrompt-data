The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that `a` is not empty and `a` ends with `0`, after executing `a.pop()`, the last element `0` will be removed from `a`. 

Since the initial state specifies that `a` is not empty and ends with `0`, after the `pop` operation, `a` will still be not empty (unless `a` originally had only one element, which is `0`). If `a` originally had more than one element, `a` will now have one less element, but it will still be non-empty.

Output State: **`a` is not empty (unless it originally had only one element, in which case it is now empty) and does not end with `0`.**
