The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element is initially set to 0, this element is removed, and the list `a` now starts with the second element that was originally in the list.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input line with the first element removed; `res` is 0.**
