The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Given that `a` starts with `0`, after the operation, `a` will no longer contain this initial `0`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 999, `n` is the newly input integer, `a` is a list of integers (initial `0` has been removed), `res` is 0**.
