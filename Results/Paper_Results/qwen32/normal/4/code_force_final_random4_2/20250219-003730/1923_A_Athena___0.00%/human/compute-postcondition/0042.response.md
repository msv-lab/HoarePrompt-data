Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `n` is the newly input integer, `a` is the list with all leading zeros removed, `res` is 0.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, the variable `a` will no longer have any zeros at the beginning of the list. The variables `t`, `n`, and `res` will remain unchanged from their initial states.
