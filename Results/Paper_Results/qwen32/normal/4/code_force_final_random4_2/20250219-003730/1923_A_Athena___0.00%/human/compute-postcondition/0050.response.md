To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a)`, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state:

1. **`t`**: An input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\).
2. **`n`**: A newly input integer. However, the exact value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, and it is not used in the print statement.
3. **`a`**: A list with all trailing zeros removed (possibly empty).
4. **`res`**: An integer initialized to 0. However, it is not used in the print statement.

The variable `a` is described as a list with all trailing zeros removed. This means that `a` could be any list that has had all trailing zeros (if any) removed. Since the initial state does not provide the exact contents of `a`, we can only describe it in a general way.

Given this information, the output of the `print(a)` statement will be the list `a` as it is, which could be any list with no trailing zeros.

Output: **a (where a is a list with all trailing zeros removed)**
