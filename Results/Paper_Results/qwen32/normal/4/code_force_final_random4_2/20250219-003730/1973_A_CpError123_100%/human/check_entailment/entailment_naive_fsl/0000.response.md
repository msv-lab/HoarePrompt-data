Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
- We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players.
- The scores are provided in non-decreasing order: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
- If the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games, we should return -1.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \).
3. It checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints -1 because the total points must be even (each game adds 2 points, so the sum must be even).
4. It calculates \( x = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \) and \( y = a + b \).
5. It prints the minimum of \( x \) and \( y \).

### Correctness Verification
Let's verify if this logic is correct for all possible cases:

1. **Even Sum Check**: The check for the sum of scores being even is correct because each game adds 2 points, so the total points must be even. If the sum is odd, the scores are invalid.

2. **Calculation of Draws**:
   - \( x = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \) represents the total number of games played since each game contributes 2 points.
   - \( y = a + b \) represents the sum of the points of the two players with the lower scores.
   - The maximum number of draws is the minimum of \( x \) and \( y \) because:
     - Draws contribute 1 point to each player, so the number of draws cannot exceed the total number of games.
     - Draws also cannot exceed the points of the two players with the lower scores because each draw adds 1 point to each player.

### Edge Cases
Let's consider some edge cases:
- **All Scores Zero**: \( (0, 0, 0) \) -> The sum is even, and the maximum number of draws is 0.
- **One Draw**: \( (0, 1, 1) \) -> The sum is even, and the maximum number of draws is 1.
- **Valid Scores with Draws**: \( (3, 4, 5) \) -> The sum is even, and the maximum number of draws is 6.
- **Invalid Scores**: \( (1, 1, 10) \) -> The sum is odd, so it should return -1.

### Conclusion
The program seems to handle all the cases correctly. It checks for the even sum and calculates the maximum number of draws correctly based on the logic provided.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly handles all the described cases and edge cases, ensuring that the maximum number of draws is calculated accurately and invalid scores are correctly identified.
