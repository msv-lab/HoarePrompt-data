The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables or the state of the program outside of the loop context. Since there is no loop context provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement has no impact on the variables or the program state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30; `a`, `b`, and `c` are new integers provided by the input, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd; `x` is the integer value of (a + b + c) // 2; `y` is the integer value of `a + b`.**
