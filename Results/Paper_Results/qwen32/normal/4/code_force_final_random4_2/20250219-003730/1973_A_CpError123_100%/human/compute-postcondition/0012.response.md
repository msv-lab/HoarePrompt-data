The provided Python code snippet contains a `print(-1)` statement. This statement will print the integer `-1` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y` as defined in the initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0 and is decremented by 1.
   - `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, and their sum is odd.
   - `x` is the integer value of \((a + b + c) // 2\).
   - `y` is the integer value of \(a + b\).

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code snippet contains a single `print(-1)` statement.
   - This statement does not depend on the values of any variables; it simply prints the integer `-1`.

Given the above, the output of the `print(-1)` statement is straightforward and does not change based on the initial state or the values of the variables.

Output: **-1**
