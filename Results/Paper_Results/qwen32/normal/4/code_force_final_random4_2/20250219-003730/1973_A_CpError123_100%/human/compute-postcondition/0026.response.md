To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the state of the variables `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` as well as the behavior of the loop.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    x = (a + b + c) // 2
    y = a + b
    print(min(x, y))
```

- The loop will execute `t` times.
- For each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next iteration.
- If the sum is even, it calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2` and `y` as `a + b`, then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.

From the provided states after the first 3 iterations, we understand that `t` has decremented by 3, and the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged. This indicates that these three variables are not being modified within the loop.

After all `t` iterations are completed:
- `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times and decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration.
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` will remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

The output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **t is 0, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has run for the number of times specified by the initial value of `t`, `t` will be reduced to 0, and the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` will remain the same as they were initially.
