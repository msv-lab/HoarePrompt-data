### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the annotations to ensure that the original assessment is correct. The provided program and its annotations seem to follow a logical approach to solving the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Total Points Constraint**: 
   - The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. If it is not, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is impossible given the rules of the game.
   - This is a valid check because each game results in exactly 2 points being awarded.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`, which represents the maximum number of games played since each game awards 2 points.
   - The program calculates `y` as `a + b`, which represents the total points of the two players with the lowest scores.
   - The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is because the maximum number of draws is limited by the total number of games played (`x`) and the points of the two lowest-scoring players (`y`).

3. **Validation Against Test Cases**:
   - **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0`
     - Total points: 0 (even)
     - `x = 0`, `y = 0`
     - Output: `0` (correct)
   - **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1`
     - Total points: 2 (even)
     - `x = 1`, `y = 1`
     - Output: `1` (correct)
   - **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1`
     - Total points: 3 (odd)
     - Output: `-1` (correct)
   - **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2`
     - Total points: 4 (even)
     - `x = 2`, `y = 2`
     - Output: `2` (correct)
   - **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3`
     - Total points: 9 (odd)
     - Output: `-1` (correct)
   - **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5`
     - Total points: 12 (even)
     - `x = 6`, `y = 7`
     - Output: `6` (correct)
   - **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10`
     - Total points: 12 (even)
     - `x = 6`, `y = 2`
     - Output: `2` (correct)

Based on the above reasoning and the validation against all provided test cases, the program appears to be correctly implemented and adheres to the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
