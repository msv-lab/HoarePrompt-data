### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players after playing chess games. The logic used in the program can be broken down as follows:

1. **Total Points Check**: The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. This is because each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2 to the winner and 0 to the loser, or 1 to each in case of a draw). If the total points are odd, it's impossible to have a valid set of games, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.

2. **Maximum Possible Draws Calculation**: If the total points are even, the program calculates `x = (a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the maximum possible number of draws since each draw contributes 2 points.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The program then calculates `y = a + b`. This is because the player with the highest score `c` could have played at most `a + b` games (against each of the other two players). The maximum number of draws is thus constrained by the minimum of `x` and `y`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`, which represents the maximum number of draws that could have happened.

### Verification with Examples:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Input: `0 0 0`**  
   - Sum of scores: `0` (even)
   - `x = 0`, `y = 0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Input: `0 1 1`**  
   - Sum of scores: `2` (even)
   - `x = 1`, `y = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Input: `1 1 1`**  
   - Sum of scores: `3` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Input: `1 1 2`**  
   - Sum of scores: `4` (even)
   - `x = 2`, `y = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Input: `3 3 3`**  
   - Sum of scores: `9` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Input: `3 4 5`**  
   - Sum of scores: `12` (even)
   - `x = 6`, `y = 7`
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Input: `1 1 10`**  
   - Sum of scores: `12` (even)
   - `x = 6`, `y = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or to identify when the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
