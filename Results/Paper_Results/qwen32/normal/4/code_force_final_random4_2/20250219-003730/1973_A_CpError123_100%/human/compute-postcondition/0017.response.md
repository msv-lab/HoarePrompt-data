To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(x, y))` statement, let's break down the values of the variables `x` and `y` based on the provided initial state.

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t`: An input integer greater than 0, decremented by 1. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.
   - `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`: Integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. These variables are not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore them as well.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`: New integers provided by the input, with the condition that the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd.
   - `x`: The integer value of `(a + b + c) // 2`.
   - `y`: The integer value of `a + b`.

2. **Calculating `x` and `y`:**
   - Since the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, we know that `(a + b + c) % 2 == 1`. This means that `(a + b + c) // 2` will be the integer part of the division, effectively rounding down to the nearest whole number.
   - `y` is simply the sum of `a` and `b`.

3. **Determining `min(x, y)`:**
   - `x = (a + b + c) // 2`
   - `y = a + b`
   - Since `a + b + c` is odd, `a + b` and `(a + b + c) // 2` will be different. Specifically, `(a + b + c) // 2` will be less than `a + b` because the division by 2 will round down the odd sum.
   - Therefore, `x` will always be less than `y` when the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd.

Given this analysis, the `print(min(x, y))` statement will always print the value of `x`.

Output: **x (where x is the integer value of (a + b + c) // 2 and a + b + c is odd)**
