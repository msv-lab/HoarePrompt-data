The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c`. This means the previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are overwritten by the new input values.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and is decremented by 1.
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd.
- `x` is the integer value of (a + b + c) // 2.
- `y` is the integer value of `a + b`.

After the code snippet executes, `a`, `b`, and `c` will have new values based on the input, and the conditions related to these variables (such as their sum being odd) will need to be re-evaluated with the new values. The values of `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified later in the code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30; `a`, `b`, and `c` are new integers provided by the input, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd; `x` is the integer value of (a + b + c) // 2; `y` is the integer value of `a + b`.**
