### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided solution, and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Constraints**: 
  - Scores \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
  - Each game results in either 2 points (win/loss) or 2 points (draw).
  - Total points must be even.
- **Objective**: 
  - Find the maximum number of draws possible.
  - Return `-1` if the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints `-1`.
- If the sum is even, it calculates `x` as half the total sum of the scores and `y` as the sum of the two lower scores.
- It prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.

#### Validation Against Test Cases:
Let's validate the provided test cases against the logic of the program.

1. **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: 0 (even)
   - `x = 0`, `y = 0`
   - Output: `0` (correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: 2 (even)
   - `x = 1`, `y = 1`
   - Output: `1` (correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: 3 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: 4 (even)
   - `x = 2`, `y = 2`
   - Output: `2` (correct)

5. **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: 9 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (correct)

6. **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - `x = 6`, `y = 7`
   - Output: `6` (correct)

7. **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - `x = 6`, `y = 2`
   - Output: `2` (correct)

#### Additional Considerations:
- **Total Points Constraint**: The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it returns `-1`. This is necessary because an odd total sum of points is impossible under the given rules.
- **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The program calculates `x` as half the total points and `y` as the sum of the lower two scores. The minimum of `x` and `y` correctly represents the maximum possible number of draws. This is because the sum of the lower two scores `y` represents the maximum points that could have resulted from draws between the two lower-scoring players.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the provided test cases and adheres to the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly checks for the even total points and calculates the maximum number of draws based on the provided scores.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
