The given code snippet contains a `print(-1)` statement. This statement will output the integer value `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables (`t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y`) described in the initial state. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y`.
2. However, the `print` statement specifically outputs `-1`.
3. The value of `-1` is a constant and does not depend on any of the other variables.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
