### Reasoning:

The provided function aims to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players in chess games. Here's a breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Sum of Scores**: The function first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is a necessary condition because each game results in a total of 2 points being awarded (either 2 to the winner, or 1 to each player in case of a draw). If the sum is odd, it's impossible to achieve these scores through any combination of games, hence the function correctly prints `-1`.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - **Case 1**: If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it means the highest score `p3` is at least as large as the sum of the other two scores. In this scenario, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because the player with `p3` could have drawn all games with the other two players, and the remaining games could have been won by the player with `p3`. This is a valid scenario where the scores can be achieved.
   - **Case 2**: If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the function attempts to find a valid number of draws `cur` such that the conditions are met. The variables `low` and `high` are used to define the range of possible draws. The function iterates through this range to find a valid configuration where the scores can be achieved. If a valid configuration is found, it prints the total number of draws. If no valid configuration is found after the loop, it defaults to printing `p3`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles cases where no games were played (`p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`) by printing `0` draws.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are impossible to achieve by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identify impossible score configurations. It covers all necessary conditions and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
