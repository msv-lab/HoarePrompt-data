You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) such test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases and terminated. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` hold the values of the last test case, and `t` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integer scores representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the scores. The result is determined by checking if the sum of the scores is even and then applying specific conditions to derive the output. If the sum is odd, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum possible score that can be achieved under the given constraints and prints that value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Three friends play chess games against each other.
- Each game results in:
  - 2 points for the winner, 0 for the loser (if there's a winner).
  - 1 point for each player (if it's a draw).
- We are given the scores of the three players in non-decreasing order (p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3).
- We need to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened.
- If the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games, we should return -1.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it:
1. Checks if the total points (p1 + p2 + p3) are even. If not, it prints -1 (since each game results in an even number of points).
2. If p3 ≥ p1 + p2, it prints p1 + p2, suggesting that the maximum number of draws is the sum of the lower two scores.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the range between p3 - p1 and p3 - p2 and iterates through this range to find a valid number of draws.
4. If a valid number of draws is found, it prints the number of draws; otherwise, it prints p3.

### Test Cases Analysis:
Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases and some additional edge cases.

#### Example Test Cases:
1. **Input:** 0 0 0
   - **Output:** 0
   - **Explanation:** No games played, so no draws.
2. **Input:** 0 1 1
   - **Output:** 1
   - **Explanation:** One draw between the second and third player.
3. **Input:** 1 1 1
   - **Output:** -1
   - **Explanation:** Impossible to have these scores with the given rules.
4. **Input:** 1 1 2
   - **Output:** 2
   - **Explanation:** Two games (one draw and one win/loss).
5. **Input:** 3 3 3
   - **Output:** -1
   - **Explanation:** Impossible to have these scores with the given rules.
6. **Input:** 3 4 5
   - **Output:** 6
   - **Explanation:** Six games (three draws and three wins/losses).
7. **Input:** 1 1 10
   - **Output:** 2
   - **Explanation:** Two draws and four wins/losses.

#### Additional Test Cases:
1. **Input:** 0 0 2
   - **Output:** 1
   - **Explanation:** One game with a winner and one draw.
2. **Input:** 2 2 4
   - **Output:** 2
   - **Explanation:** Two games with one draw and one win/loss.
3. **Input:** 0 2 4
   - **Output:** 2
   - **Explanation:** Two games with one draw and one win/loss.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle the provided example test cases correctly. However, let's try to find any potential edge cases or inconsistencies that the program might not handle correctly.

### Edge Case Analysis:
1. **Scores with Total Points Odd:**
   - **Input:** 0 1 2
   - **Output:** -1
   - **Explanation:** The total points are 3, which is odd, so no valid set of games can produce these scores. The program correctly returns -1.

2. **Scores with Maximum Draws:**
   - **Input:** 0 0 0
   - **Output:** 0
   - **Explanation:** No games played, so no draws. The program correctly returns 0.

3. **Scores with Impossibility:**
   - **Input:** 1 1 1
   - **Output:** -1
   - **Explanation:** Impossible to have these scores with the given rules. The program correctly returns -1.

4. **Scores with Valid Draws:**
   - **Input:** 1 1 2
   - **Output:** 2
   - **Explanation:** Two games (one draw and one win/loss). The program correctly returns 2.

Based on the analysis, the program handles the provided test cases and additional edge cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program seems to correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description.
