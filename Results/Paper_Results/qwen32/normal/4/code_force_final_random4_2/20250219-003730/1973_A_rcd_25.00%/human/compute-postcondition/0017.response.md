Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `low` is `p3 - p2`; `high` is `p3 - p1`; `cur` is `low + 1`; and `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)`**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `low + 1`. All other conditions and initial state constraints remain unchanged.
