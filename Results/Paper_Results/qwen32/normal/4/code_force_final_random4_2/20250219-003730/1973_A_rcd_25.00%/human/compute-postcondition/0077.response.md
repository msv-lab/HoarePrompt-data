Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1`, and if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `high`.**
