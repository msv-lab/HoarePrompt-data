Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is equal to `low`; the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
