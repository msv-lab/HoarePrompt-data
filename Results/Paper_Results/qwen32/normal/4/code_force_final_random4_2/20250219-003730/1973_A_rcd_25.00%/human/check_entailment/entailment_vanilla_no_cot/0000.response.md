To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the logic it uses and compare it with the problem requirements.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` which represent the scores of the three players in non-decreasing order.

2. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points from all games must be even (since each game distributes 2 points in total, either 2 to the winner or 1 to each player in case of a draw).

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - **Case 1**: If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it means that the highest score `p3` is at least as large as the sum of the other two scores. This implies that all games between the player with score `p3` and the other two players could have ended in draws, leading to `p1 + p2` draws. This is because the player with score `p3` could have drawn with the other two players `p1` and `p2` times, each contributing to `p1` and `p2` points respectively.
   - **Case 2**: If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program calculates the possible number of draws more carefully. It calculates `low` and `high` which represent the minimum and maximum possible differences between `p3` and `p1` and `p3` and `p2`. It then iterates over possible values of draws `cur` from `low` to `high` and checks if a valid configuration of wins and draws can lead to the given scores. If a valid configuration is found, it prints the number of draws. If no valid configuration is found after the loop, it prints `p3`.

Let's verify the correctness of this logic using the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: `0 0 0` - No games were played, so the output should be `0`. The program correctly outputs `0`.
- **Example 2**: `0 1 1` - One game ended in a draw, so the output should be `1`. The program correctly outputs `1`.
- **Example 3**: `1 1 1` - There's no way to achieve these scores, so the output should be `-1`. The program correctly outputs `-1`.
- **Example 4**: `1 1 2` - Two games could have ended in draws, so the output should be `2`. The program correctly outputs `2`.
- **Example 5**: `3 3 3` - There's no way to achieve these scores, so the output should be `-1`. The program correctly outputs `-1`.
- **Example 6**: `3 4 5` - Six games could have ended in draws, so the output should be `6`. The program correctly outputs `6`.
- **Example 7**: `1 1 10` - Two games could have ended in draws, so the output should be `2`. The program correctly outputs `2`.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to correctly handle the logic for determining the maximum number of draws or identifying invalid score configurations.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
