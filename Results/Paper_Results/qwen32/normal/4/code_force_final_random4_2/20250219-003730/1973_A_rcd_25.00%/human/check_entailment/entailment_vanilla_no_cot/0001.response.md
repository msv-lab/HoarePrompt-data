Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Key Points of the Problem

1. **Scores and Validity**: The sum of the scores `p1 + p2 + p3` must be even because each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed among the players (either 2 for the winner and 0 for the loser, or 1 each in case of a draw).

2. **Maximum Draws**: The goal is to maximize the number of draws. Draws contribute 1 point to each of the two players involved, while a win contributes 2 points to the winner and 0 to the loser.

3. **Constraints on Draws**:
   - The maximum number of draws can be `p1 + p2` if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. This is because all the points that `p1` and `p2` have can come from draws with `p3`.
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, then the situation is more complex, and we need to find a valid distribution of wins and draws.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Validity**: The program first checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the scores cannot be valid.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program correctly prints `p1 + p2` because all the points of `p1` and `p2` can come from draws with `p3`.
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program calculates the range of possible draws between `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and tries to find a valid number of draws that satisfies the conditions.

4. **Finding Valid Draws**:
   - The program uses a loop to check if a certain number of draws `cur` can be valid. It checks if `p1 - cur` (remaining points for `p1` after accounting for draws) is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)` (remaining points for `p2` after accounting for draws and the points `p3` has given away).
   - If a valid `cur` is found, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` (total draws plus points `p3` has).
   - If no valid `cur` is found, it prints `p3`.

### Correctness Verification

The program correctly handles the conditions and constraints described in the problem. It ensures that the sum of the scores is even and calculates the maximum possible number of draws based on the given scores.

### Conclusion

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the analysis provided.

Correctness: **True**
