The code snippet provided is a `continue` statement, which does not affect the values of variables or the flow of the program in a way that changes their state. It is typically used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration.

Since there is no loop in the provided context, the `continue` statement has no effect on the program's state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**
