To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables `cur`, `low`, and `high` evolve throughout the iterations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `low = p3 - p2`
   - `high = p3 - p1`
   - `cur = p3 - p2`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `high >= cur`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the loop breaks and prints `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1.

4. **Termination:**
   - The loop terminates either when the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met, or when `cur` exceeds `high`.

### Analysis of the Loop Behavior

- **First Iteration:**
  - `cur = p3 - p2`
  - Checks if `p1 - (p3 - p2) <= p2 - (p3 - (p3 - p2))`, which simplifies to `p1 - (p3 - p2) <= p2 - p2` or `p1 - (p3 - p2) <= 0`.
  - If true, prints `p1 - (p3 - p2) + p3` and exits.
  - If false, increments `cur` to `p3 - p2 + 1`.

- **Subsequent Iterations:**
  - Continues to check the condition with the incremented `cur`.
  - If the condition is met at any point, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and exits.
  - If `cur` exceeds `high`, the loop terminates and prints `p3`.

### Final Output State

The loop will continue to increment `cur` until either:
- The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met, in which case it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and exits.
- `cur` exceeds `high` (i.e., `cur > p3 - p1`), in which case it prints `p3` and exits.

Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, the final output will be either `p1 - cur + p3` (if the condition is met at some point) or `p3` (if the condition is never met and `cur` exceeds `high`).

### Conclusion

The output state after the loop executes all iterations will be either:
- The value printed when the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met, which is `p1 - cur + p3`.
- The value `p3` if the condition is never met and `cur` exceeds `high`.

Since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not provided, we can only describe the possible outcomes based on the loop's behavior.

Output State: **The loop prints either `p1 - cur + p3` if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met at some point, or `p3` if `cur` exceeds `high` without meeting the condition.**
