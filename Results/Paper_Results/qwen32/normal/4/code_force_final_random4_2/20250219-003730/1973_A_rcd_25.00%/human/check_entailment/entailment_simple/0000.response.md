### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic it uses to compute the maximum number of draws for each test case. Let's break down the program's logic and verify it against the problem requirements.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Initial Check for Valid Scores:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because the total points from all games must be even (each game results in a total of 2 points, either 2 for the winner or 1+1 for a draw).

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws:**
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it means the highest score `p3` is at least as large as the sum of the other two scores. In this case, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because the highest-scoring player could have drawn with both of the other players.
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program calculates the possible number of draws using the variables `low` and `high`:
     - `low` is the minimum of `(p3 - p1)` and `(p3 - p2)`.
     - `high` is the maximum of `(p3 - p1)` and `(p3 - p2)`.
     - The program then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a valid number of draws `cur` such that `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. This condition ensures that the remaining points after accounting for the draws can be distributed among the players in a valid way.
     - If a valid `cur` is found, the program prints `p1 - cur + p3` as the maximum number of draws.
     - If no valid `cur` is found, the program prints `p3`.

### Verification Against Test Cases:

Let's verify the program logic against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1: `0 0 0`**
   - Sum is `0`, which is even.
   - `p3 < p1 + p2` is false, so it prints `p1 + p2 = 0`.
   - **Correct Output: `0`**

2. **Test Case 2: `0 1 1`**
   - Sum is `2`, which is even.
   - `p3 < p1 + p2` is true.
   - `low = 0`, `high = 1`.
   - `cur = 0` satisfies `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, so it prints `p1 - cur + p3 = 1`.
   - **Correct Output: `1`**

3. **Test Case 3: `1 1 1`**
   - Sum is `3`, which is odd.
   - **Correct Output: `-1`**

4. **Test Case 4: `1 1 2`**
   - Sum is `4`, which is even.
   - `p3 < p1 + p2` is true.
   - `low = 0`, `high = 1`.
   - `cur = 0` does not satisfy `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
   - `cur = 1` satisfies `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, so it prints `p1 - cur + p3 = 2`.
   - **Correct Output: `2`**

5. **Test Case 5: `3 3 3`**
   - Sum is `9`, which is odd.
   - **Correct Output: `-1`**

6. **Test Case 6: `3 4 5`**
   - Sum is `12`, which is even.
   - `p3 < p1 + p2` is true.
   - `low = 0`, `high = 2`.
   - `cur = 0` does not satisfy `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
   - `cur = 1` does not satisfy `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
   - `cur = 2` satisfies `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, so it prints `p1 - cur + p3 = 6`.
   - **Correct Output: `6`**

7. **Test Case 7: `1 1 10`**
   - Sum is `12`, which is even.
   - `p3 < p1 + p2` is false, so it prints `p1 + p2 = 2`.
   - **Correct Output: `2`**

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the provided test cases and adheres to the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
