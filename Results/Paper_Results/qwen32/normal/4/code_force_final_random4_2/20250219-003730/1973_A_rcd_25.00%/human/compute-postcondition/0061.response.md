The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply advances to the next iteration of the loop it is within. Since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**
