Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input, satisfying the conditions: \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1)
```

The task is to determine what will be printed when the `print(-1)` statement is executed.

Analysis:
- The value to be printed is explicitly given in the code snippet as `-1`.
- The variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the code snippet is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
