The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` does not affect the execution of the loop itself, as they are used within the loop body, not in the loop head.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged and do not need adjustment for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30**
