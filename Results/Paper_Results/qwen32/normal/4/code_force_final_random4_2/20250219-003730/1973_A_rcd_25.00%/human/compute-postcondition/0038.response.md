The value of `cur` is assigned the value of `low`. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is equal to `low`.
Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is equal to `low`.**
