The code snippet assigns new values to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` by reading a line of input, splitting it into three parts, converting each part to an integer, and then mapping these integers to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` respectively. The initial state of `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is not affected except for the reassignment of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, where `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input.**
