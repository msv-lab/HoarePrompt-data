Postcondition: **`l` is 1 and `r` is at least 1, or `l` is 0 and `r` is at least 0, and `k` is greater than 0. If `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[l]` has been reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` has been reduced by `mi`, and `k` has been reduced by `mi * 2`. If `a[r]` was 0, `ans` has been incremented by 1. If `a[l]` was initially 0, `l` has been incremented by 1 and `ans` has been incremented by 1. Otherwise, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `t` is `k % 2`, and if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is incremented by 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
