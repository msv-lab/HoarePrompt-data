Postcondition: **`l` is either 1 or 0, `r` is `n - 2` if `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is reduced by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 2 if both `a[l]` and `a[r]` are 0, 1 if either `a[l]` or `a[r]` is 0, and 0 if neither `a[l]` nor `a[r]` is 0. If `a[r]` is 0, `a[r]` is explicitly set to 0. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `l` remains 0, `r` remains `n - 1`, `k` remains greater than 0, and `ans` is set to 1 if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, otherwise `ans` remains 0, where `t` is `k % 2`. `T` remains False in both cases. `n` is the first input value (as an integer), and `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi` if `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.**
