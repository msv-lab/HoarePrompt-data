The provided code snippet converts each string in the list `a` to an integer. This means that the list `a` will now contain integers instead of strings. The values of `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
