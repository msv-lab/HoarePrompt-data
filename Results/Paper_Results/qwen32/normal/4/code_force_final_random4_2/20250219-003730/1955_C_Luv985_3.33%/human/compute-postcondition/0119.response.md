The code snippet `a[l] -= mi` subtracts the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` from `a[l]`. Given that `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, the value of `a[l]` will be reduced by `mi`.

If `a[l]` was initially equal to `mi`, then `a[l]` will become 0. If `a[l]` was greater than `mi`, then `a[l]` will be reduced by `mi` but will still be positive.

Output State: **`l` is 1 and `r` is at least 2, or `l` is 0 and `r` is at least 1, and `k` is greater than 0; `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, where `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**
