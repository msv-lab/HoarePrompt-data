Postcondition: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is the first input value (as an integer), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `mi * 2` is greater than `k`. If `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. `T` is False, and `t` is `k % 2`.**
