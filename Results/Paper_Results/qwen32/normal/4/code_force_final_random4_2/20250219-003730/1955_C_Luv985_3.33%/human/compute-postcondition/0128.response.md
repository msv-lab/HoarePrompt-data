`t` is assigned the value of `k % 2`. This means `t` will be either 0 or 1, depending on whether `k` is even or odd. The values of `l`, `r`, and `mi` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` is 1 and `r` is at least 2, or `l` is 0 and `r` is at least 1, and `k` is greater than 0; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `t` is `k % 2`.**
