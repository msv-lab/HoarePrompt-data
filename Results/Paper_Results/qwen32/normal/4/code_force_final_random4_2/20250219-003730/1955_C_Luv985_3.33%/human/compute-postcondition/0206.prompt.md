Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is the final left index, `r` is the final right index, `k` is the remaining value, and `ans` is the total number of elements reduced to zero. If `k >= a[l]`, then `ans` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `l` is the number of elements from the start that have been fully used, `r` is the number of elements from the end that have been fully used, `k` is the remaining value, `ans` is the total number of elements fully used plus 1 if `k >= a[l]` else `ans` remains unchanged, `T` is False, `n` is the initial number of elements, and `a` is the list with updated values. Additionally, if `l` was equal to `r` before the if statement, `l` remains equal to `r` after the if statement. If `l` was not equal to `r`, then `ans` remains unchanged and the other variables retain their initial values.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is 5, `k` is 0, `l` is 2, `r` is 3, `ans` is 3, `T` is 0, `a` is [0, 0, 5, 6, 0]. If `l` equals `r`, the condition is checked but no changes are made to the variables.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
