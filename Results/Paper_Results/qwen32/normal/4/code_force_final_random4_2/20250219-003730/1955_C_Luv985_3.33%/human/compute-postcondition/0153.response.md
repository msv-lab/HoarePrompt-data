Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `T` is 0, `a` is the list with updated integer values from the input where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, `mi` is `min(a[0] - mi, a[n - 1] - mi)`, and `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language: The value of `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
