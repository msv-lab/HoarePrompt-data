The only object in the loop head is the variable `q`. Therefore, we only need to adjust `q` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `ans` is a set containing at least one more element besides `x`, we need to select the next element from `ans` to be assigned to `q` at the start of the next iteration.

Let's denote the current value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration as `q_prev`. Since `ans` is a set and sets are unordered, we cannot predict the exact next value of `q` directly. However, we know that `ans` contains at least one more element besides `x`, so we can denote the next value of `q` as `q_next`, which is some element from `ans` other than `q_prev`.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing at least one more element besides `x`, `r` is the integer value returned by `int(func_1().split()[0])`, `c` is the value returned by `func_1().split()[1]`. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set. `q` is `q_next`, where `q_next` is the next element in `ans` other than the current `q`.**
