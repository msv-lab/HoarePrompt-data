The code snippet provided adds a new element to the `temp` set based on the current values of `q`, `r`, and `n`. The value added is `(q - r) % n`.

Given the initial state, `temp` already contains the element `(q + r) % n`. Now, it will also contain `(q - r) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration and still greater than 0, `x` is unchanged, `ans` contains at least two elements, `r` is the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]` (now as an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]` (now as a string). `q` is the next element in `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**

Natural Language: The value of `temp` now includes two elements: `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. All other variables retain their previous values.
