Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a few issues that can lead to incorrect results.

1. **Handling of Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation in Python (`%`) can return `0` when the result of the subtraction or addition is a multiple of `n`. This can happen when the ball is thrown such that it lands on player `0` (which is equivalent to player `n` in a circle). The code correctly handles this by converting `0` to `n` if `0` is in the set `ans`. However, this conversion should be done before printing the results, not after, because the set `ans` should always contain valid player numbers (from `1` to `n`).

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The code does not explicitly handle the case where `n` is `1`. Although the problem constraints specify that `n` is at least `2`, it is good practice to handle edge cases. However, since the problem guarantees `n >= 2`, this is not a critical issue.

3. **Output Order**: The problem requires the output of player numbers in increasing order. The code uses a set to store possible player numbers, which does not guarantee any order. When printing, the set should be converted to a sorted list to ensure the output is in increasing order.

Here is a potential fix for the issues identified:

```python
import sys
from functools import lru_cache

# Function 1:
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())

# Function 3:
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))

# Function 4:
def func_4():
    (n, m, x) = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        (r, c) = func_1().split()
        r = int(r)
        temp = set()
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        ans = temp
    # Ensure that 0 is converted to n if present
    if 0 in ans:
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    # Convert the set to a sorted list for output
    sorted_ans = sorted(ans)
    print(len(sorted_ans))
    print(*sorted_ans)

# Example usage:
# func_4()
```

With these changes, the program should correctly handle all potential cases and produce the output in the required format.
