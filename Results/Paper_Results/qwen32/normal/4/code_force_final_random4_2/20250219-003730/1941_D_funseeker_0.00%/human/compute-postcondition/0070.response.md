The code snippet `ans = temp` assigns the value of `temp` to `ans`. The other variables `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, `c`, and the precondition for `temp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the initial value minus the number of iterations, `m` is 0, `x` is unchanged, `ans` contains all unique values `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` based on the value of `c`, `r` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `temp` contains all unique values `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` based on the value of `c`.**
