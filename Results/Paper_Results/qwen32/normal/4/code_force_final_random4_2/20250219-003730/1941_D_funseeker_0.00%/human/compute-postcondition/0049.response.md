The code snippet `r, c = func_1().split()` will split the string returned by `func_1()` into two parts and assign them to `r` and `c` respectively. Given that `r` was previously the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]` and `c` was the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]`, after executing the code, `r` will be a string (the first part of the split result) and `c` will be a string (the second part of the split result).

The variables `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration and still greater than 0, `x` is unchanged, `ans` contains all computed values `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` based on the value of `c`, `r` is the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]` (now as a string), and `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]` (now as a string)**.
