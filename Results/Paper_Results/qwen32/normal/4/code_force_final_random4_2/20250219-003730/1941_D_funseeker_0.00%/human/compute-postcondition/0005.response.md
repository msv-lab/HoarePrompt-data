The code snippet initializes a new set named `temp`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, or `c`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for these variables, except for the addition of the new variable `temp`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing `x`, `r` is the integer value returned by `int(func_1().split()[0])`, `c` is the value returned by `func_1().split()[1]`, `temp` is an empty set.**
