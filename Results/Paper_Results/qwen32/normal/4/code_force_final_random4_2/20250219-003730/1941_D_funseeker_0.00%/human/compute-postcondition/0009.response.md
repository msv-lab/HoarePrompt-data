Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing `x`, `r` is the integer value returned by `int(func_1().split()[0])`, and `c` is the value returned by `func_1().split()[1]`. If `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.**
