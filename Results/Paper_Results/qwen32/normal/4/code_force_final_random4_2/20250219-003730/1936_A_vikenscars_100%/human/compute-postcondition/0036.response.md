The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, so we need to adjust `i` to the next value. Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_old`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_old + 1`.

State: **`max_item_idx` is the largest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<', `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`. If `ans1` is '<', `pair_idx` is set to `i`. If `ans1` is '=', `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`, and if `ans2` is '>', `pair_idx` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `pair_idx` remains unchanged.**

Since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, the final state considering only `i` and `n` is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`**
