To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the function call `ans = func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, which means we can't determine the exact value of `ans` or any changes to other variables based solely on the given information.

Given the lack of definition for `func_1` and the fact that the function's return value and side effects are unknown, we can only state that `ans` is assigned the result of the function call with the provided arguments. The values of `n` and `max_item_idx` remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them, which is not indicated in the provided code snippet.

Thus, the Output State can be described as:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is 0, `ans` is the result of `func_1(0, 0, i, i)`**.
