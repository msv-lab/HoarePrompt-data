The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `pair_idx`. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their described conditions or values. Therefore, `pair_idx` is now equal to `i`, and `i` remains `i + 1`. The conditions for `n` and `ans1` are still valid.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, `pair_idx` is `i`**.
