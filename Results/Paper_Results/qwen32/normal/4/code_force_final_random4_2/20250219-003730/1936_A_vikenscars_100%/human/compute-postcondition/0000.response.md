The variable `max_item_idx` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `max_item_idx` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4; `max_item_idx` is 0**
