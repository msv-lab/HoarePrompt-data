Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

# Annotated Functions:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string 's' is a palindrome, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns `False`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of the string s, and x is an integer initialized to -1.
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: s (where s is the input string)
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is the index of the first character that differs from `s[0]` or -1 if no such character exists, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`.
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing (None).
    #State: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is the index of the first character that differs from `s[0]` and `x` is not equal to -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:] (where s[:x + 1] includes the first part of the string up to the first differing character, and s[x + 1:] includes the rest of the string)
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
            print('NO')
            #This is printed: NO
        else :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(2)
            #This is printed: 2
            print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
            #This is printed: s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:] (where s[:x + 2] is the substring from the start of s up to and including the character at index x + 1, and s[x + 2:] is the substring from the character at index x + 2 to the end of s)
        #State: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is the index of the first character that differs from `s[0]` and `x` is not equal to -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`. Additionally, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`. The current value of `x` is either 1, `n // 2`, or neither.
    #State: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is the index of the first character that differs from `s[0]` and `x` is not equal to -1, `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, then `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`. Otherwise, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True` and `x` is either 1, `n // 2`, or neither.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string `s` from the input, checks certain conditions based on the characters in the string and the result of an external function `func_1`, and prints specific messages and substrings of `s` based on these conditions. The function does not accept any parameters and always returns `None`.
