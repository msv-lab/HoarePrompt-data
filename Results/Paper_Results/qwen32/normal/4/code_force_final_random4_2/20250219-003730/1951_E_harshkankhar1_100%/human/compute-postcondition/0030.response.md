To determine the output, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `s` is the input string.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that differs from `s[0]` and `x` is not equal to -1.
- `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`, which means the entire string `s` satisfies some condition defined by `func_1`.
- `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, which means the substring of `s` starting from `x + 1` to the end does not satisfy the condition defined by `func_1`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
```

This statement will print two parts of the string `s` separated by a space:
1. `s[:x + 1]`: This is the substring from the start of `s` up to and including the character at index `x`.
2. `s[x + 1:]`: This is the substring from the character at index `x + 1` to the end of `s`.

### Explanation:
- `s[:x + 1]` includes all characters from the beginning of the string up to and including the first character that differs from `s[0]`.
- `s[x + 1:]` includes all characters from the character after the first differing character to the end of the string.

### Output:
The output will be the two substrings separated by a space.

Output: **s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:] (where s[:x + 1] is the substring from the start of s up to and including the first character that differs from s[0], and s[x + 1:] is the substring from the character after the first differing character to the end of s)**

In simpler terms, the output will be the part of the string up to the first differing character, followed by a space, and then the rest of the string.

Output: **s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:] (where s[:x + 1] is the substring from the start of s up to and including the first character that differs from s[0], and s[x + 1:] is the substring from the character after the first differing character to the end of s)**

To make it more precise and clear:
Output: **s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:] (where s[:x + 1] is the substring from the start of s up to and including the first character that differs from s[0], and s[x + 1:] is the substring from the character after the first differing character to the end of s)**

Since we don't have the exact string `s`, we cannot provide the exact substrings, but we can describe them based on the given conditions.

Output: **s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:] (where s[:x + 1] is the substring from the start of s up to and including the first character that differs from s[0], and s[x + 1:] is the substring from the character after the first differing character to the end of s)**

For clarity, let's format it as:
Output: **s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:] (where s[:x + 1] includes the first part of the string up to the first differing character, and s[x + 1:] includes the rest of the string)**
