The initial state provides information about the variables `s`, `n`, `x`, and the result of the function call `func_1(s[0:])`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply `print(1)`, which means it will print the integer `1` regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1(s[0:])`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `s` is the input string.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is assigned the value `-1`.
- `func_1(s[0:])` returns `False`.

None of these variables or the function result are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and will output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
