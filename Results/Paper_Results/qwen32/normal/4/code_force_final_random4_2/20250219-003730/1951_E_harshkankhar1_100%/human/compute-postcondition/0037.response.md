To determine what the provided print statement will output, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `s` is the input string.
2. `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
3. `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that differs from `s[0]`, and `x` is not equal to -1.
4. `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`.
5. `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`.
6. `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
```

### Explanation:
- `s[:x + 2]` will extract the substring from the start of `s` up to and including the character at index `x + 1`.
- `s[x + 2:]` will extract the substring from the character at index `x + 2` to the end of `s`.

### Key Points:
- `x` is the index of the first character that differs from `s[0]`, so `s[0]` to `s[x - 1]` (if any) are all the same character.
- `s[x]` is the first character that differs from `s[0]`.
- Since `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, we have more specific constraints on where `x` can be, but the exact value of `x` is not provided.

### Output Determination:
Given the initial state, let's consider the substrings:
- `s[:x + 2]` includes the initial sequence of characters that are the same (`s[0]` to `s[x - 1]`), followed by the first differing character (`s[x]`), and one more character (`s[x + 1]`).
- `s[x + 2:]` includes everything from the character immediately following the first differing character's next character (`s[x + 2]`) to the end of the string.

### Example:
If `s = "aaabbbccc"`, then:
- `s[0]` is 'a'.
- `x = 3` (since 'b' is the first character that differs from 'a').
- `s[:x + 2]` is `"aaab"`.
- `s[x + 2:]` is `"bbccc"`.

### General Case:
Without knowing the exact string `s`, we can still describe the output in terms of the string `s` and the index `x`:
- The first part of the output will include the sequence of characters from the start of `s` up to and including the character at index `x + 1`.
- The second part of the output will include the sequence of characters from the character at index `x + 2` to the end of `s`.

### Final Output:
Output: **s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:] (where s[:x + 2] is the substring from the start of s up to and including the character at index x + 1, and s[x + 2:] is the substring from the character at index x + 2 to the end of s)**
