Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string and is greater than or equal to 2, `x` is `i`, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`. The loop or if statement is broken, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The input string `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged. The variable `x` still holds the value of `i`. The function `func_1(s[0:])` still returns `True`. The loop or if statement is exited, and `i` is incremented by 1.
