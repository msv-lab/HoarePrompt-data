The code snippet `s = input()` reassigns the variable `s` to the value of the input provided by the user. The initial state specifies that `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, but after the execution of the code, `s` will be whatever string is provided as input. The length of the string `s` (denoted by `n`) will be updated to the length of the new input string. The variable `x` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the input string; `n` is the length of the input string; `x` is -1.**
