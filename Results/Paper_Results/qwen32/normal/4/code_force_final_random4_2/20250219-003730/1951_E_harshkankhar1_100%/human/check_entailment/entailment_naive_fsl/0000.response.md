Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not correctly partition the string into non-palindrome substrings for all possible inputs. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Handling of Single Character Strings**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the string consists of a single character. For example, if the input string is "a", it should output "NO" because the only partition is the string itself, which is a palindrome.

2. **Handling of Strings with Repeated Characters**:
   - The program only checks if the first character is different from the rest of the string to determine if a partition is possible. This is insufficient. For example, consider the string "abba". The program will partition it into "ab" and "ba", both of which are not palindromes, but it fails to handle cases like "aaaa" correctly. The program should be able to partition "aaaa" into "aa" and "aa", but it will incorrectly return "NO".

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - The program does not correctly handle more complex cases where multiple partitions are needed. For example, the string "abacaba" should be partitioned into "ab", "a", "c", "aba", but the program will not correctly identify such a partition.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
a
aaaa
abacaba
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
YES
2
aa aa
YES
3
ab a c aba
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
YES
2
a aaa
NO
YES
2
abac ab
```

The program incorrectly handles these cases, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
