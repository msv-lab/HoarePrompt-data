The function reads the number of vertices `n` and the edges of a tree, constructs an adjacency list `u2vs`, and then calculates the longest path in the tree. It determines the middle point(s) of this longest path and generates a list of operations based on whether the path length is odd or even. The function prints the number of operations and the operations themselves, where each operation is a tuple of a vertex and an index. The function returns `None`.
