The code provided appends a tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Here, `c2` is a specific vertex from the list `path_ba`, and `i` is a variable that is not specified in the initial state, so we assume `i` is a given value or variable in the context not provided here. 

Since the value of `i` is not specified, we will keep it as `i` in the output state. The other variables remain unchanged except for `ops`, which now includes the new tuple `(c2, i)`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree structure; `d` is a list where `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `a` to vertex `i` in the tree; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, starting with `b` and ending with `a`, and must have at least 3 elements; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c1, c2)` and the newly added tuple `(c2, i)`; the length of `path_ba` is even; `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`; `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`; `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`.**
