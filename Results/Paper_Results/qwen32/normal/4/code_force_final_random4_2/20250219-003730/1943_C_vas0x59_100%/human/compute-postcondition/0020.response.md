Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree structure, and all other lists are populated accordingly to reflect the tree's edges.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `u2vs` will fully represent the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges. Each sublist at index `i` will contain all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree. No sublist will remain empty, except for those corresponding to vertices that have no connections, which is not possible in a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges.
