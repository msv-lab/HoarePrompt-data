You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    print(func_1(n, s1, s2))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0's and '1's.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    counter = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
                counter += 1
                i += 2
            else:
                counter += 1
                i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State: - The loop will continue until `i` reaches `n`, meaning it will iterate through each character of `s1` and `s2`.
    #   - The `counter` will be incremented each time there is a mismatch between `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` that meets the conditions specified in the loop.
    #   - The variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop completes.
    #
    #Given the above, the final state of the variables will be:
    #- `n` remains the same (as it is not modified in the loop).
    #- `s1` and `s2` remain the same (as they are only read, not modified).
    #- `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs until `i` is no longer less than `n`.
    #- `counter` will be the total number of mismatches between `s1` and `s2` that meet the conditions specified in the loop.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished is:
    #
    #Output State:
    return counter
    #The program returns the total number of mismatches between `s1` and `s2` that meet the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a positive integer `n` and two binary strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` as input. It returns the count of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ, considering specific conditions for consecutive mismatches.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to transform the initial state of cats in boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`) using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed are:
1. Adding a cat to an empty box.
2. Removing a cat from a box.
3. Moving a cat from one box to another.

The program should output the minimum number of operations required for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of boxes (`n`), the initial state (`s1`), and the desired state (`s2`). It then calls the function `func_1` to compute the minimum number of operations.

The `func_1` function iterates through each box and counts the number of mismatches between `s1` and `s2`. If there is a mismatch at position `i`, it checks if the next position (`i + 1`) also has a mismatch and if the states at `i` and `i + 1` are different. If so, it considers this as a single operation (a swap), otherwise, it counts it as a single operation (either an addition or removal).

### Correctness Check:
Let's evaluate the program's logic to see if it correctly computes the minimum number of operations:

1. **Mismatch Handling:** If there is a mismatch at position `i`, the program checks if the next position (`i + 1`) also has a mismatch and if the states at `i` and `i + 1` are different. If both conditions are met, it counts it as a single operation (swap). This is correct because swapping two adjacent boxes is a single operation.
   
2. **Single Operation Counting:** If the conditions for a swap are not met, the program counts it as a single operation (either addition or removal). This is also correct because adding or removing a cat from a box is a single operation.

3. **Edge Cases:** The program correctly handles edge cases where there are no mismatches (no operations needed), or where all mismatches can be resolved by swaps.

### Testing with Example:
Let's test the program with the example provided in the problem statement:

**Input:**
```
6
5
10010
00001
1
1
1
3
000
111
4
0101
1010
3
100
101
8
10011001
11111110
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
0
3
2
1
4
```

Running the program with this input should produce the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state to the desired state. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
