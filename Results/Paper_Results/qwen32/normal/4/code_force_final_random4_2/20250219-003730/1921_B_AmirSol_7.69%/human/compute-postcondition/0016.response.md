The value of `i` is incremented by 2. The values of `n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `counter` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `i` is now `i + 2` (and still less than `n`), and `counter` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `i` is `i + 2`, and `counter` is incremented by 1.**
