Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 1, `i` is 0 such that `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`. Additionally, `i < n - 1`, `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]`, and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`.**

The value of `counter` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
