You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0's and '1's.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    counter = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
                counter += 1
                i += 2
            else:
                counter += 1
                i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State: - The loop will continue until `i` reaches `n`, meaning it will iterate through each character of `s1` and `s2`.
    #   - The `counter` will be incremented each time there is a mismatch between `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` that meets the conditions specified in the loop.
    #   - The variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop completes.
    #
    #Given the above, the final state of the variables will be:
    #- `n` remains the same (as it is not modified in the loop).
    #- `s1` and `s2` remain the same (as they are only read, not modified).
    #- `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs until `i` is no longer less than `n`.
    #- `counter` will be the total number of mismatches between `s1` and `s2` that meet the conditions specified in the loop.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished is:
    #
    #Output State:
    return counter
    #The program returns the total number of mismatches between `s1` and `s2` that meet the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and two strings `s1` and `s2`, each of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. The function returns the total number of positions at which the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total number of mismatches between `s1` and `s2` that meet the conditions specified in the loop.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
