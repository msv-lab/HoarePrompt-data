The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `counter`) remain unchanged. Since `i` was initially 0, it is now 1. The precondition that `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, and the `i`-th character of `s1` is equal to the `i`-th character of `s2` still holds true for the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 0, `i` is 1, and the `i`-th character of `s1` is equal to the `i`-th character of `s2`.**
