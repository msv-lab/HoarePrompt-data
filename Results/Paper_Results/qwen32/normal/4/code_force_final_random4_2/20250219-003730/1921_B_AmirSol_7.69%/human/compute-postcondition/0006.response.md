The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Given the initial state, `i` was initially set to a value such that `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, and `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]`, with the additional condition that `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`. After the increment, `i` will point to the position `i + 2`, and the conditions involving `i` and `i + 1` will still hold for the new `i` position, assuming the initial conditions were valid for the initial `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 1, `i` is `i + 2` such that `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`. Additionally, `i < n - 1`, `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]`, and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`.**
