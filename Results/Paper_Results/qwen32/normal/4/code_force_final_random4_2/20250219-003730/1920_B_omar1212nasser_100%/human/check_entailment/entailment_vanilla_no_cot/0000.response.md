Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Alice's Strategy (Removals)**:
   - Alice should remove the `k` smallest elements to maximize the sum after Bob's turn. This is because removing the smallest elements minimizes the negative impact on the sum.

2. **Bob's Strategy (Negations)**:
   - After Alice's removals, Bob should negate the `x` smallest remaining elements to minimize the sum. This is because negating the smallest remaining elements will have the largest negative impact on the sum.

The provided program attempts to calculate the sum by considering different removals and negations but does not correctly implement the optimal strategies as described above. Specifically, the program does not sort the array after Alice's removals to correctly identify the smallest elements for Bob to negate.

Here's a corrected version of the program that implements the optimal strategies:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Alice removes the k smallest elements
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob negates the x smallest remaining elements
        a.sort()
        for j in range(min(x, len(a))):
            a[j] = -a[j]
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        print(sum(a))

# Example usage:
# func_1()
```

This corrected program first sorts the array and removes the `k` smallest elements. It then sorts the remaining elements and negates the `x` smallest elements, ensuring that both players act optimally.
