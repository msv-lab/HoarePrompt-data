The code snippet provided subtracts the last element of the `elements` list from `s2`. This means that the value of `s2` is updated by decreasing it by `elements[-i]`.

Given the initial state, we need to adjust the value of `s2` accordingly.

Output State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing elements `(s - e_i) - 2 * s2` and `s - 2 * s2`, `s2` is updated to `s2 - elements[-i]`, `s` is decreased by `elements[-i]`**

In simpler terms: The value of `s2` has been decreased by the last element of the `elements` list. All other conditions and variables remain as they were initially described, except for the updated `s2`.
