The code snippet provided adds the element at the index `-(negatives + i)` of the list `elements` to `s2`. Let's break down the impact of this operation on the variables involved:

- `s2` is updated by adding the value of `elements[-(negatives + i)]` to it.
- The other variables (`removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, `s`) remain unchanged as per the given code snippet.

Given the initial state, `s2` will now be equal to its previous value plus the value of `elements[-(negatives + i)]`.

Output State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing one element `(s - e_i) - 2 * s2`, `s` is `s - e_i`, `s2` is `s2 - elements[-i] + elements[-(negatives + i)]`, and `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`.**
