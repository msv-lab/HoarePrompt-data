Output State: **`removals` is greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing elements `(s - e_i) - 2 * s2`, `s - 2 * s2`, and now also `s - 2 * s2`. `s` is decreased by `elements[-4]`. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + i)]`. `i` is 4. `s2` is decreased by `elements[-4]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `s2` has been decreased by the value of `elements[-4]`. All other variables retain their initial state or conditions as described.
