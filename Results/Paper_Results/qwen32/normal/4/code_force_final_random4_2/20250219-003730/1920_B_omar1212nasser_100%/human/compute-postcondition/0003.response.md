The code snippet calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements of the `elements` list and assigns it to the variable `s2`. Given the initial state, the value of `s2` will be `sum(elements[-negatives:])`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`removals` is a non-negative integer, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing one element `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, `s` is the sum of `elements`, `s2` is `sum(elements[-negatives:])`.**
