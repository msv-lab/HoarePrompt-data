The code snippet provided updates the variable `s2` by adding the value of `elements[-(negatives + i)]` to it. This means that `s2` is incremented by the element at the index `-(negatives + i)` from the `elements` list.

Here are the changes:
- `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + i)]`.

The other variables (`removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, `s`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and conditions.

Output State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing elements `(s - e_i) - 2 * s2` and `s - 2 * s2`, `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + i)]`, `s` is decreased by `elements[-i]`.**
