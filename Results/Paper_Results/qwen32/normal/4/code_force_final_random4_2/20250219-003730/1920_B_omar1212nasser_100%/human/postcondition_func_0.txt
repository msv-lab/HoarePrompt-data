The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`, integers `k` and `x`, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. For each test case, it sorts the list `a`, then calculates and prints the maximum possible sum of the list after allowing Alice to remove up to `k` elements and Bob to multiply up to `x` elements by -1.
