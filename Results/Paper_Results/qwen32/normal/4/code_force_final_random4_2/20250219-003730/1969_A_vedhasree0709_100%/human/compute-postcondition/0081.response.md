The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, so after the increment, `i` becomes 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `j`, `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 1; `p` is `l[0]`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is 1 and `q` is 1. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
