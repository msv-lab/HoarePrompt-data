Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `j` is initialized to 0.
- `p` is set to `l[0]`.
- `q` is set to `l[p - 1]`.
- `q` is then reassigned to `i + 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(2)
```

The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `p`, or `q`. It simply prints the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
