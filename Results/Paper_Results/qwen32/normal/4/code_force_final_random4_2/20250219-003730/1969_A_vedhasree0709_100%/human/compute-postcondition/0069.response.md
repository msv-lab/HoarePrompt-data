The code snippet `n = int(input())` will overwrite the previous value of `n` with the new integer input provided by the user. The values of `t`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is `n`; `j` is 0 if `q` equals `i + 1` has not occurred at any iteration.**
