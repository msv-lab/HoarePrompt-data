Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n].
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i <= n - 1:
        p = l[i]
        q = l[p - 1]
        if q == i + 1:
            print(2)
            j = 1
            break
        i += 1
    if j == 0:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers derived from the input; `i` is `n`; `j` is 0. The current value of `j` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is `n`; `j` is 0 if `q` equals `i + 1` has not occurred at any iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer such that `t >= 1`. `n` remains unchanged as the input integer. `l` remains unchanged as the new list of integers derived from the input. `i` will be `n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking. `j` is 0, indicating that `q == i + 1` was never met at any point during the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
