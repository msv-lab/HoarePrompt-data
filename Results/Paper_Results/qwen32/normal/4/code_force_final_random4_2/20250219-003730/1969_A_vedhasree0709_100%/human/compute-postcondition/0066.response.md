The given `print` statement is:
```python
print(3)
```

In this case, the value to be printed is explicitly provided in the code. It does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `q`). The `print` statement is simply outputting the integer `3`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **3**
