Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `l` is a list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 1; `p` is the element at index 1 in the list `l`; `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l`; `j` is 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `p`, `q`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
