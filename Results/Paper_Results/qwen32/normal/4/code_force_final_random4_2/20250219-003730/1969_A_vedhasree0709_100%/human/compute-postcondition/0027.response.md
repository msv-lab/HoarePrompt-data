Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `l` is a list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 2; `p` is the element at index 2 in the list `l`; `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l`; `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
