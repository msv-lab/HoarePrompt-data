Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `j` is 1 if `q` equals `i + 1`, otherwise `j` remains 0.
- `p` is `l[1]`.
- `q` is `l[l[1] - 1]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print(2)`. This statement directly prints the integer `2` to the console.

### Key Points:
- The value to be printed is explicitly given as `2` in the `print` statement.
- None of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `p`, or `q` are used in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect what is printed.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the integer `2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2**
