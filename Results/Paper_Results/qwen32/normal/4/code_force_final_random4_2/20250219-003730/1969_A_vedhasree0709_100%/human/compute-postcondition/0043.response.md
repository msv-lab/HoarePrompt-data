Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state step-by-step:

- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `p` is `l[0]`.
- `q` is `l[p - 1]`.
- `q` equals `i + 1`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(2)
```

The `print(2)` statement will simply print the integer value `2`.

It's important to note that the value of `2` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement and is not dependent on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `p`, or `q`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **2**
