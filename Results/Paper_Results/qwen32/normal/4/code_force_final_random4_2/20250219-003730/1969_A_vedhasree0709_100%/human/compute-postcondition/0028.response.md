Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `l` is a list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 2; `p` is the element at index 2 in the list `l`; `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
