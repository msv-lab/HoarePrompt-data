Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where the first element is `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all `a_i`'s being distinct. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `x` is the value of the `k`-th element in the current test case list within `a`. If `a[i] > x`, `ind` is a list containing the index `i` where `a[i]` is greater than `x` and includes the current value of `i`. Otherwise, `ind` remains unchanged. `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] > x`, `c` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged.**
