Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet**: The function `func_1` is called in the loop but is not defined anywhere in the provided code snippet. This will cause a `NameError`.

2. **Logic Errors**:
    - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum number of wins for cow `k`, but it does not correctly implement the logic for all scenarios.
    - The function does not consider the possibility of swapping cow `k` with another cow to maximize wins.
    - The function does not handle the case where cow `k` is already in a position that maximizes its wins without any swap.
    - The function does not correctly calculate the number of wins when cow `k` is swapped with another cow.

3. **Incorrect Index Handling**:
    - The variable `n` is used in `func_1`, but it is not passed as an argument to the function. This will cause a `NameError`.
    - The logic for calculating wins does not correctly account for the initial position and the effect of swapping.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def max_wins(a, k):
    n = len(a)
    k -= 1
    max_wins_no_swap = 0
    current_max = a[k]
    
    # Calculate max wins without swap
    for i in range(k + 1, n):
        if a[i] > current_max:
            break
        max_wins_no_swap += 1
        current_max = a[i]
    
    # Try to swap with each cow and calculate max wins
    max_wins_swap = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i == k:
            continue
        a[k], a[i] = a[i], a[k]
        current_max = a[k]
        wins = 0
        if i == 0:
            for j in range(1, n):
                if a[j] > current_max:
                    break
                wins += 1
                current_max = a[j]
        else:
            if a[i-1] > a[k]:
                break
            wins = 1
            current_max = a[i-1]
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if a[j] > current_max:
                    break
                wins += 1
                current_max = a[j]
        max_wins_swap = max(max_wins_swap, wins)
        a[k], a[i] = a[i], a[k]  # Swap back
    
    return max(max_wins_no_swap, max_wins_swap)

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(max_wins(a, k))
```

This corrected program calculates the maximum number of wins for cow `k` both with and without a swap, and returns the maximum of the two.
