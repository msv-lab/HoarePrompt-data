The function `func_1` processes a list `a` that contains test cases. Each test case includes two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` distinct integers representing Cowdeforces ratings. The function determines and returns a specific index based on the conditions related to the value at index `k` and the indices of up to the first two elements greater than this value. The return value depends on the positions of these elements relative to `k`.
