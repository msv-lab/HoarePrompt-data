You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where the first element is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all a_i's being distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            ind.append(i)
            c += 1
        
        if c == 2:
            break
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `x` remains the k-th element, `ind` contains indices of up to the first two elements greater than `x`, and `c` is the count of these elements (0, 1, or 2).

        return n - 1
        #The program returns n - 1
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `x` remains the k-th element, `ind` contains indices of up to the first two elements greater than `x`, and `c` is the count of these elements (0, 1, or 2). Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list.
    if (len(ind) == 1) :
        if (ind[0] == 0) :
            return k - 1
            #The program returns k - 1
        #State: `a` remains unchanged, `x` remains the k-th element, `ind` contains indices of up to the first two elements greater than `x`, `c` is the count of these elements (0, 1, or 2). Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list and the current length of `ind` is 1. The first element of `ind` is not 0.
        if (ind[0] > k) :
            return ind[0] - 1

Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list and the current length of `ind` is 1. The first element of `ind` is not 0 and is less than or equal to `k`.
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
        #The program returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the first element of the list `ind` and is not 0 and is less than or equal to `k`.
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `x` remains the k-th element, `ind` contains indices of up to the first two elements greater than `x`, and `c` is the count of these elements (0, 1, or 2). Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list and the length of `ind` is 2.
    if (ind[0] == 0) :
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
        #The program returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `x` remains the k-th element, `ind` contains indices of up to the first two elements greater than `x`, and `c` is the count of these elements (0, 1, or 2). Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list and the length of `ind` is 2. The first element of `ind` is not 0.
    if (k > ind[1]) :
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
        #The program returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`, which is `ind[1] - ind[0]` given the constraints.
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `x` remains the k-th element, `ind` contains indices of up to the first two elements greater than `x`, and `c` is the count of these elements (0, 1, or 2). Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list and the length of `ind` is 2. The first element of `ind` is not 0, and `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`.
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])
    #The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` where the first element is `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` distinct integers representing Cowdeforces ratings. The function returns different values based on certain conditions:
#- Case_1: Returns `n - 1` under unspecified conditions.
#- Case_2: Returns `k - 1` under unspecified conditions.
#- Case_3: Returns a value that is one less than the first element of `ind` which is greater than `k` and not 0.
#- Case_4: Returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the first element of the list `ind` that is not 0 and is less than or equal to `k`.
#- Case_5: Returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
#- Case_6: Returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`, which simplifies to `ind[1] - ind[0]` given the constraints.
#- Case_7: Returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns n - 1

Case_2: The program returns k - 1

Case_3: The program returns a value that is one less than the first element of `ind`, which is greater than `k` and not 0.

Case_4: The program returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the first element of the list `ind` and is not 0 and is less than or equal to `k`.

Case_5: The program returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.

Case_6: The program returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`, which is `ind[1] - ind[0]` given the constraints.

Case_7: The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`
