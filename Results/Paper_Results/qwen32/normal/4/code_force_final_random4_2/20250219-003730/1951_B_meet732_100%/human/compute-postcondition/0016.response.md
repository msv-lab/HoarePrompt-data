Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where the first element is `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all `a_i`'s being distinct. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `x` is the value of the `k`-th element in the current test case list within `a`. `ind` is a list containing the indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than `x` and includes the current value of `i` up to the point where `c` was incremented to 2 or the loop was terminated. `i` is the index of the element that was being processed when the loop was terminated. If `c` equals 2, the loop is terminated by the `break` statement. Otherwise, the loop continues until `i` reaches `n`. If `a[i] > x`, `c` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged.**
