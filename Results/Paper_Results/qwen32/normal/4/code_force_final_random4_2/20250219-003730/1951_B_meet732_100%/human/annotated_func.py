#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where the first element is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all a_i's being distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list `a` that contains test cases. Each test case includes two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` distinct integers representing Cowdeforces ratings. The function determines and returns a specific index based on the conditions related to the value at index `k` and the indices of up to the first two elements greater than this value. The return value depends on the positions of these elements relative to `k`.
