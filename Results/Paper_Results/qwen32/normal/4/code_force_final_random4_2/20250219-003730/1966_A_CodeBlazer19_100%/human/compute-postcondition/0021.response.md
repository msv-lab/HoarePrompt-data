To determine what will be printed by the `print(k - 1)` statement, we need to understand the value of `k` based on the given initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 4 (though `i` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `k` is the second integer from the new input.
- `l` is a new list of integers from the input.
- `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(k - 1)
```

From the initial state, we know that `k` is the second integer from the new input. Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can only express the output in terms of `k`.

Thus, the expression `k - 1` will be evaluated using the value of `k` provided in the input.

Therefore, the output will be `k - 1`.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is the second integer from the new input)**
