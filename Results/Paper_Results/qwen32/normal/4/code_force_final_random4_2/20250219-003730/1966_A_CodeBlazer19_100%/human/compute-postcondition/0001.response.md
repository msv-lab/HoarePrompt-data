The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is the loop control variable and will be initialized by the `range(t)` function, so we don't need to adjust `i` before the loop starts. The variables `n`, `k`, and `c` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted according to the task requirements.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is not adjusted before the loop starts**
