### Reasoning:
The problem states that we need to determine the minimum number of cards left in our hand after performing the allowed operations any number of times. The key observation is that if we have any number that appears at least `k` times, we can reduce the count of that number by `1` each time we perform the operation. This is because we can exchange `k` cards of the same number for `k-1` cards, effectively reducing the count of that number by `1`. 

The function correctly identifies this by counting the occurrences of each unique number in the list of cards. If any number appears at least `k` times, the function returns `k-1` as we can always reduce the count of that number by performing the operation, and the minimum number of cards left will be `k-1`. If no number appears at least `k` times, then no operation can be performed, and the minimum number of cards left is the total number of cards, `n`.

Given the execution summary, the function behaves as expected for the provided test cases. It checks the counts of card numbers and returns `k-1` if any number appears at least `k` times, otherwise it returns the total number of cards.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
