Let's analyze the provided code step by step and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to minimize the number of cards in your hand by repeatedly performing the following operation:
- Choose any `k` cards with the same number and exchange them for `k-1` cards with any numbers.

The objective is to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing any number of these operations.

### Key Observations
1. **Count of Cards**: To determine the minimum number of cards left, we need to look at how many cards of each number we have.
2. **Operation Impact**: If there are `m` cards of a particular number and `m >= k`, we can repeatedly perform the operation to reduce the count of these cards. Each operation reduces the count by 1 (`m` becomes `m - 1` after each operation).
3. **Minimum Cards Left**: 
   - If the maximum count of any number is `m` and `m >= k`, then we can reduce the count to `m % (k - 1) + (k - 1)` if `m % (k - 1) != 0`, otherwise, it will be `m % (k - 1)`. This is because we can perform the operation as many times as possible, reducing the count by `k - 1` each time.
   - If `m < k` for all numbers, no operations can be performed, and the number of cards remains `n`.

### Code Analysis
Let's analyze the provided code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        if max(p) >= k:
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)
```

1. **Reading Input**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
2. **Counting Cards**: The list `p` contains the counts of each unique card number.
3. **Condition Check**: The code checks if the maximum count of any card number is `>= k`.
   - If true, it prints `k - 1`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the proper reduction of the count using the modulo operation.
   - If false, it prints `n`, which is correct because no operations can be performed if no card number appears `k` or more times.

### Conclusion
The code fails to correctly compute the minimum number of cards left when the maximum count of any card number is `>= k`. It should compute the reduced count using the modulo operation, not simply print `k - 1`.

### Correctness
Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations as described in the problem statement.
