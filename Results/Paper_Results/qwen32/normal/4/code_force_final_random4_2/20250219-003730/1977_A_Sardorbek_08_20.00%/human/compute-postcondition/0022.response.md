Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
2. Each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
3. `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
4. `b` and `c` are integers read from the input.
5. `q` is a tuple `(b, c)`.
6. If `b` equals `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. Otherwise, `b` is not equal to `c`, and if `b` is less than `c`, then `b` is less than `c`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.
7. If `a % 2` equals `b % 2`, then the condition `a % 2 == b % 2` is true. Otherwise, the condition `a % 2 == b % 2` is false.
8. `i` is 4.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet simply prints the string `'Yes'`. The values of variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables. It directly outputs the string `'Yes'`.

### Output:
Output: **Yes**
