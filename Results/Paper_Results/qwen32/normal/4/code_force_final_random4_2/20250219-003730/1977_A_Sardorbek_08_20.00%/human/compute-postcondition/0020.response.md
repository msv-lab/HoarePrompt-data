The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides various conditions and variable descriptions, but none of these variables or conditions affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, or `i`.

Here's the breakdown of the given information:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- Each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` between 1 and 100.
- `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `b` and `c` are integers read from the input.
- `q` is a tuple `(b, c)`.
- There are conditions comparing `b` and `c` and checking if `a % 2` equals `b % 2`.
- `i` is set to 4.

However, none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
