To determine the final output state after the loop executes all its iterations, let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states after the first 3 iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates `a` times. In each iteration:
- It reads two integers `b` and `c`.
- It creates a tuple `q = (b, c)`.
- It prints 'YES' if `b == c`.
- It prints 'NO' if `b < c`.
- It prints 'Yes' if `b >= c` and `a % 2 == b % 2`.
- It prints 'No' if `b >= c` and `a % 2 != b % 2`.

### Given Output States:
1. **After 1 iteration**: The loop has executed once, meaning `a` is at least 1.
2. **After 2 iterations**: The loop has executed twice, meaning `a` is at least 2.
3. **After 3 iterations**: The loop has executed three times, meaning `a` is at least 3.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute exactly `a` times. After all iterations are completed, the loop variable `i` will be equal to `a` (since the loop runs from 0 to `a-1`).

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains the same as the initial state.
- `a` remains the same as the initial state.
- `i` will be equal to `a` after the loop finishes.
- `b` and `c` will be the values read in the last iteration.
- `q` will be the tuple `(b, c)` from the last iteration.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, each of the following t lines contains two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `a`, `b` and `c` are the integers read in the last iteration, and `q` is the tuple `(b, c)` from the last iteration.**
