The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides several variables and conditions but none of them affect the content of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q`.

Let's break it down:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- Each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m`, both between 1 and 100.
- `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `b` and `c` are integers read from the input.
- `q` is a tuple `(b, c)`.
- `b` is not equal to `c`.
- `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.
- `a % 2` equals `b % 2`.

However, none of these variables or conditions influence the `print('Yes')` statement. The statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Yes**
