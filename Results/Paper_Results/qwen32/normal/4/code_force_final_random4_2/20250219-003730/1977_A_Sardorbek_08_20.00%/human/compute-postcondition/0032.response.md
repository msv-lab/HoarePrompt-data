The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes various variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions affect the execution of the `print('Yes')` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, or `i`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
2. For each of the `t` lines, there are integers `n` and `m` between 1 and 100.
3. `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 5.
4. `b` and `c` are integers read from the input.
5. `q` is a tuple containing the values of `b` and `c`.
6. The conditions involving `a % 2` and `b % 2` do not affect the `print` statement.
7. `i` is explicitly set to 5.

Despite all these variables and conditions, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
