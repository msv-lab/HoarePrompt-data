Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Let's analyze the logic used in the program and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. The program correctly handles the case where `n` (number of moves) is equal to `m` (desired number of cubes) by printing 'YES'.
2. The program correctly handles the case where `n` is less than `m` by printing 'NO', as it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
3. However, the key logic for the remaining cases is flawed. The program checks if `a % 2 == b % 2` (where `a` is the number of test cases and `b` is the number of moves for the current test case) to determine if `n` and `m` are both even or odd, which is incorrect. The correct logic should be to check if `n - m` is even. This is because each move either adds or removes exactly one cube, so the difference between `n` and `m` must be even for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Given this analysis, the program's logic is incorrect for the third case, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
