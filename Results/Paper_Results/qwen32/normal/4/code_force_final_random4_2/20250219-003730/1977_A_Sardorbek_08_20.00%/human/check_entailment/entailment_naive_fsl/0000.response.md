Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the logic in the program is flawed and does not account for all possible scenarios.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Condition `elif b < c:`**: This condition checks if the number of moves `b` is less than the number of cubes `m`. If `b < c`, the program outputs "NO". This is incorrect because if `b` is at least `c` and `b - c` is even, it is possible to end up with `m` cubes by making `c` moves to add cubes and the remaining `b - c` moves to remove cubes in pairs (which cancel each other out).

2. **Condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:`**: This condition checks if the number of test cases `a` (which is irrelevant for each individual test case) modulo 2 is equal to the number of moves `b` modulo 2. This condition is incorrect and irrelevant to the problem. The correct condition should check if `b - c` is even, which means the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even, allowing for the possibility of ending up with `m` cubes.

3. **Output Case Sensitivity**: The problem states that the output can be in any case (lowercase or uppercase). While the program does output "Yes" and "No" correctly, it also outputs "YES" and "NO", which is acceptable, but the logic leading to those outputs is incorrect.

### Correct Logic:
- If `m` is greater than `n`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, so the answer is "NO".
- Otherwise, if `n - m` is even, it is possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, so the answer is "YES".
- If `n - m` is odd, it is impossible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, so the answer is "NO".

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if c > b:
            print('NO')
        elif (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected code properly handles all cases as described in the problem statement. The original program fails to do so, hence it is incorrect.
