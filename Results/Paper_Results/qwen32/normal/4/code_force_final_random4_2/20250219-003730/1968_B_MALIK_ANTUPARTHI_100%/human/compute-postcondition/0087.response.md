The value of `k` is updated to `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 4, `k` becomes `4 + 1`, which is `5`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is 5; `i` is 3; `b` is greater than 0; `c` is the second integer from the input; `d` is the input string; `e` is the next input from the user; `j` is 4.**
