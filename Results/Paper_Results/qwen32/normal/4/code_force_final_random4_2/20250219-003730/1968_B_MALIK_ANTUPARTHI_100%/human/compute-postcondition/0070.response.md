The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `b` and `c`. The initial state of `k` and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the new values of `b` and `c` while keeping the initial state of `k` and `i` intact.

Output State: **`k` is `b` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `k` is `j + 1`; `i` is 3; `b` is the first integer from the input; `c` is the second integer from the input.**
