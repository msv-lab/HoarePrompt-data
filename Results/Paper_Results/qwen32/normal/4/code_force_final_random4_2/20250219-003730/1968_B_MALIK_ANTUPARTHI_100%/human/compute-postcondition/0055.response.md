Postcondition: **`k` is `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k` or `k` is `j + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is a value, `e` is a value, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
