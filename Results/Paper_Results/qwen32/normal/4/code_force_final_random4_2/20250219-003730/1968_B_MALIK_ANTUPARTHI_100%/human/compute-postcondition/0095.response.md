Output State: **`k` is 6, `i` remains 3, `b` remains greater than 0, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the input string, `e` is the next input from the user, `j` is 5**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to `j + 1`, which means `k` becomes `5 + 1`, so `k` is now `6`. All other variables remain unchanged.
