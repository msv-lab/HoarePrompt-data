Postcondition: **`k` is updated to `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`, `i` is 3, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the input string, `e` is the next input from the user, and the character at index `j` in `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of `e`. Additionally, either `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`.**
