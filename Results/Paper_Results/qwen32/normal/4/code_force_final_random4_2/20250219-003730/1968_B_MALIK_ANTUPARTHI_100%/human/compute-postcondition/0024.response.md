Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `c` is an input integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is an input string; `j` is 4. If `d[4]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to `e[k:].index(d[4]) + 1 + k`. If after this update `k` equals `c` or `k` equals `b - 1`, then `k` is set to 5. If `d[4]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to 4. In both cases, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
