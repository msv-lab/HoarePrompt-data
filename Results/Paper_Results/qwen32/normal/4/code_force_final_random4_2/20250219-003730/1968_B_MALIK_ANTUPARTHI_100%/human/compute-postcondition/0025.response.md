The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `c` is an input integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is an input string; `j` is 5**.
