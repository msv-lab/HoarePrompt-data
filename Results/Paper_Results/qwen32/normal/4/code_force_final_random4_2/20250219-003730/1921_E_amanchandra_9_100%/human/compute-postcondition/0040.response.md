Postcondition: **`t` is \(t - 2\); `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers read from the input. If `a > c`, the state remains unchanged from the precondition. Otherwise, `r` is set to `min(w, d + x)` if `abs(a - c) % 2` is true, otherwise `r` is set to `min(w, b + x)`, where `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`. Additionally, `l` is set to `max(1, d - (abs(a - c) // 2))` if `abs(a - c) % 2` is true, otherwise `l` is set to `max(1, b - x)`.**
