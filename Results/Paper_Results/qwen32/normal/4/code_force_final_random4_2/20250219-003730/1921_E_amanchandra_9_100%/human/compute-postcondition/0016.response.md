Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers read from the input. If `a` is greater than `c`, the values of `r`, `w`, `b`, `c`, `d` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `r` is `min(w, d + x)` if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, otherwise `r` is `min(w, b + x)`. `x` is `(c - a) // 2`. `l` is `max(1, d - x)` if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, otherwise `l` is `max(1, b - x)`.**
