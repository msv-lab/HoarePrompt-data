To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step by step based on the problem description.

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Alice's Moves:** Down, Down-Right, Down-Left.
2. **Bob's Moves:** Up, Up-Right, Up-Left.
3. **Winning Condition:** A player wins if they move to a cell occupied by the other player's chip.
4. **Draw Condition:** If Alice cannot move (x_a = h) or Bob cannot move (x_b = 1) before the other player wins.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program's logic seems to be based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob and the number of moves they can make.

1. **Initial Check:**
   - If Alice's row (a) is greater than Bob's row (c), the program immediately prints "Draw". This is because Bob can always move up, and Alice cannot move down anymore, leading to a draw.
   
2. **Calculating Moves:**
   - If Alice's row is not greater than Bob's row, the program calculates the number of moves Alice can make vertically (`x = abs(a - c) // 2`).
   - The variable `x` represents the number of moves Alice can make to reach Bob's row or get closer to it.
   
3. **Determining the Winning Range:**
   - If the number of moves (`abs(a - c)`) is odd, the program calculates the range of columns (`l` and `r`) where Alice can be after making `x` moves.
   - If the number of moves is even, the program calculates the range of columns where Bob can be after making `x` moves.
   
4. **Checking Winning Conditions:**
   - If the number of moves is odd, the program checks if Bob's column is within the range Alice can reach after `x + 1` moves. If yes, Alice wins.
   - If the number of moves is even, the program checks if Alice's column is within the range Bob can reach after `x` moves. If yes, Bob wins.
   - Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

### Issues and Corrections:
The logic in the program seems to be based on a simplified assumption that Alice and Bob can always move optimally to reach each other. However, the logic does not correctly account for all edge cases and optimal moves.

- **Edge Cases:** The program does not correctly handle cases where Alice or Bob can force a win in fewer moves or where the board boundaries restrict their movements.
- **Optimal Moves:** The program does not consider the optimal strategy where players can force the other into a position where they cannot make a move.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all scenarios as per the problem description. It simplifies the problem in a way that does not account for all possible optimal moves and edge cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
