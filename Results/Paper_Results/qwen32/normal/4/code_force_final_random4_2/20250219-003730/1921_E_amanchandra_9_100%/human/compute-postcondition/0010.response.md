Let's break down the given code and initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is calculated as `min(w, d + x)`.
- `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers read from the input.
- `a \leq c`.
- `x` is calculated as `(c - a) // 2`.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd.
- `l` is calculated as `max(1, d - x)`.

### Code Analysis:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
```

This line of code uses a tuple indexing trick to choose between two lists based on a condition. Let's break it down:

1. **Condition**:
   - `abs(l - b) <= x + 1`
   - `abs(r - b) <= x + 1`
   - The condition is a logical AND, meaning both parts must be true for the condition to be true.

2. **Tuple Indexing**:
   - `(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[condition]`
   - If the condition is `True`, the index is `1`, so it selects `['Alice']`.
   - If the condition is `False`, the index is `0`, so it selects `['Draw']`.

3. **`*` Operator**:
   - `*` unpacks the list, so `print(*['Draw'])` prints `Draw` and `print(*['Alice'])` prints `Alice`.

### Determining the Output:
We need to evaluate the condition to determine whether it is `True` or `False`.

- `x` is `(c - a) // 2`, and since the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, `x` is an integer that represents half the distance between `a` and `c`, rounded down.
- `l` is `max(1, d - x)`, which means `l` is at least `1` and at most `d - x`.
- `r` is `min(w, d + x)`, which means `r` is the smaller of `w` and `d + x`.

The condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` checks if `b` is within a certain range relative to both `l` and `r`. If `b` is within this range, the condition is `True`, and `['Alice']` is selected. Otherwise, `['Draw']` is selected.

### Conclusion:
Without specific values for `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, we can't determine the exact numerical outcome of the condition. However, we can describe the logic that determines the output.

Output: **Draw or Alice based on the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` (where `l` is `max(1, d - x)`, `r` is `min(w, d + x)`, and `x` is `(c - a) // 2`)**

Since we can't determine the exact output without specific values, the most precise description we can provide is based on the condition given.
