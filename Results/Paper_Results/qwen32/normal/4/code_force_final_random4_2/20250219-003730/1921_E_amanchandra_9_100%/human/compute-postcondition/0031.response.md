In the given initial state, we have the following information:

- `t` is defined as \(t - 2\), which implies that `t` is being reassigned to its current value minus 2. However, the initial value of `t` is not provided, so we can't determine its exact numerical value.
- `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers read from the input. The specific values of these variables are not provided, so we can't determine their exact numerical values either.

The `print` statement in the code is:
```python
print('Draw')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Draw'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **Draw**
