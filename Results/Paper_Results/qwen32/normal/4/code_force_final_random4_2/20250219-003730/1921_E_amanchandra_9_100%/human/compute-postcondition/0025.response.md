Output State: **`t` is \(t - 1\); `r` is `min(w, b + x)`; `w`, `b`, `d` are integers read from the input; `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`; `l` is `max(1, b - x)`**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be the minimum of `w` and `b + x`. All other variables (`t`, `w`, `b`, `d`, `x`, and `l`) retain their initial values or expressions as described in the initial state.
