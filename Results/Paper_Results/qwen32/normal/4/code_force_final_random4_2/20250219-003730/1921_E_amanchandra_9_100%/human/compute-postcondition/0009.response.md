The value of `r` is updated to be the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `r` is `min(w, d + x)`; `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers read from the input; `a` is less than or equal to `c`; `x` is `(c - a) // 2`; the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd; `l` is `max(1, d - x)`**
