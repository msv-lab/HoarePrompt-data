The code snippet assigns the value of `abs(a - c) // 2` to the variable `x`. This means `x` is now the integer division of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` by 2. The values of `r`, `w`, `b`, `d`, and `t` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is \(t - 2\); `r`, `w`, `b`, `d` are integers read from the input; `a`, `c` are integers read from the input; `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`.**
