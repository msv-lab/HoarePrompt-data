The value of `x` is assigned the result of `abs(a - c) // 2`. The absolute difference between `a` and `c` is calculated, then divided by 2 using integer division. The values of `r`, `w`, `b`, `d` remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still described as `t - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is \(t - 1\); `r`, `w`, `b`, `d` are integers read from the input; `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`.**
