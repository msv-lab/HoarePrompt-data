To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic it uses to determine the winner of the game or if it results in a draw.

### Analysis of the Game Logic

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who move their chips on a checkered board according to specific rules:
- Alice can move her chip down, down-left, or down-right.
- Bob can move his chip up, up-left, or up-right.
- A player wins if they place their chip on the same cell as the opponent's chip.
- If a player cannot make a move, the game ends in a draw.

The critical point here is that Alice starts the game. The strategy revolves around the relative positions of the chips and the rows they are on.

### Analysis of the Program

Let's break down the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board dimensions `h` (rows) and `w` (columns), and the initial positions of Alice's chip `(x_a, y_a)` and Bob's chip `(x_b, y_b)`.

2. **Determine the Outcome:**
   - If `x_a` (Alice's row) is greater than `x_b` (Bob's row), the program immediately outputs "Draw". This is because Alice cannot reach Bob's row (or any row above it) since she can only move downwards.
   - If `x_a` is not greater than `x_b`, the program calculates the maximum number of moves Alice can make towards Bob's row, which is `(x_b - x_a) // 2` (integer division). This is because Alice can move diagonally or straight down, covering at most 2 rows per two moves.
   - If the difference in rows `abs(x_a - x_b)` is odd, the program calculates the range of columns Bob can occupy after Alice's moves. It checks if Bob can move to a column within this range to meet Alice.
   - If the difference in rows `abs(x_a - x_b)` is even, the program similarly calculates the range of columns and checks if Alice can move to a column within this range to meet Bob.

3. **Output:**
   - The program outputs "Alice" if she can force a win, "Bob" if he can force a win, and "Draw" if neither can force a win.

### Evaluation

The program correctly handles the cases where Alice cannot reach Bob's row (`x_a > x_b`), leading to a draw. For the other cases, it calculates the possible moves and checks if either player can force a win based on the positions and constraints.

Let's verify the program against the provided example cases:

- **Case 1:** `6 5 2 2 5 3`
  - Alice starts at row 2, Bob at row 5.
  - Alice can reach Bob's row.
  - Program correctly outputs "Alice".

- **Case 2:** `4 1 2 1 4 1`
  - Alice starts at row 2, Bob at row 4.
  - Alice can reach Bob's row.
  - Program correctly outputs "Bob".

- **Case 3:** `1 4 1 3 1 1`
  - Alice and Bob are in the same row.
  - No player can move.
  - Program correctly outputs "Draw".

- **Case 4:** `5 5 1 4 5 2`
  - Alice starts at row 1, Bob at row 5.
  - Alice can reach Bob's row.
  - Program correctly outputs "Draw".

- **Case 5:** `4 4 1 1 4 4`
  - Alice starts at row 1, Bob at row 4.
  - Alice can reach Bob's row.
  - Program correctly outputs "Draw".

- **Case 6:** `10 10 1 6 10 8`
  - Alice starts at row 1, Bob at row 10.
  - Alice can reach Bob's row.
  - Program correctly outputs "Alice".

- **Case 7:** `10 10 2 6 10 7`
  - Alice starts at row 2, Bob at row 10.
  - Alice can reach Bob's row.
  - Program correctly outputs "Draw".

- **Case 8:** `10 10 9 1 8 1`
  - Alice starts at row 9, Bob at row 8.
  - Bob can reach Alice's row.
  - Program correctly outputs "Draw".

- **Case 9:** `10 10 8 1 10 2`
  - Alice starts at row 8, Bob at row 10.
  - Alice can reach Bob's row.
  - Program correctly outputs "Bob".

- **Case 10:** `10 10 1 1 2 1`
  - Alice starts at row 1, Bob at row 2.
  - Alice can reach Bob's row.
  - Program correctly outputs "Alice".

- **Case 11:** `10 10 1 3 4 1`
  - Alice starts at row 1, Bob at row 4.
  - Alice can reach Bob's row.
  - Program correctly outputs "Alice".

- **Case 12:** `10 10 3 1 1 1`
  - Alice starts at row 3, Bob at row 1.
  - Bob can reach Alice's row.
  - Program correctly outputs "Draw".
