The value of `r` is updated to be the minimum of `w` and `b + x`. The values of `t`, `w`, `b`, `d`, `a`, `c`, `x`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is \(t - 2\); `r` is `min(w, b + x)`; `w`, `b`, `d` are integers read from the input; `a`, `c` are integers read from the input; `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`; `l` is `max(1, b - x)`**
