The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means that the value of `t` will be updated based on the input provided. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`) remain unchanged as they are not mentioned in the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.**
