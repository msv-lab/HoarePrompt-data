The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provided describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, `ans`, `cnt`, and `cur`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is a literal and does not depend on any variables or their values.
3. The initial state provides information about several variables but does not influence the output of the `print` statement because it is not referencing any of these variables.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
