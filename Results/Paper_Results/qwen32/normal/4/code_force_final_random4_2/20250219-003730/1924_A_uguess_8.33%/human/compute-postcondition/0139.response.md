Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m`, `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `i` remain unchanged; `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in `s` in the alphabet. If `cur & 1 << i == 0`, `tmp` is the character at position `i` in the alphabet. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string. `ans` is a string consisting of the character at position `k-1` in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times.**
