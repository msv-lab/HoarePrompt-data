The code snippet `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` calculates the ASCII value of the character that is `i` positions after 'a' and assigns it to the variable `tmp`. Given that `i` is 1, `tmp` will be assigned the value 'b'.

Here are the variables that remain unchanged: `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, and `ans`.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `cnt` is less than `n` and holds the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was found in the string `s`, `cur` will be 0 if the last processed subset of `k` distinct characters completed a sequence, or it will be a value reflecting the bits of the characters processed since the last completed sequence, `ans` is a string consisting of the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the ASCII table, repeated `cnt` times, `i` is 1, `tmp` is 'b'**.
