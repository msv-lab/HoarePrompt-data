Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
cur += 1 << cur_ss
```

This line of code adds `1 << cur_ss` to the current value of `cur`. Here, `1 << cur_ss` is a bitwise left shift operation, which means `1` is shifted to the left by `cur_ss` positions. This is equivalent to `2 ** cur_ss`.

Given the initial state:
- `cnt` is `1` if `cur` was updated to `(1 << k) - 1`; otherwise, `cnt` remains `0`.
- `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
- `cur` is updated to `(1 << k) - 1` if the initial `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`; otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged or set to `1 << cur_ss` based on the initial condition.
- `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.

After executing `cur += 1 << cur_ss`, the value of `cur` will be its previous value plus `2 ** cur_ss`.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged. `cnt` is `1` if `cur` was updated to `(1 << k) - 1` before the operation; otherwise, `cnt` remains `0`. `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. `cur` is its previous value plus `2 ** cur_ss`. `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.**

In simple terms, the value of `cur` is incremented by `2 ** cur_ss`, and all other variables remain unchanged unless `cur` was previously `(1 << k) - 1`, in which case `cnt` is `1`.
