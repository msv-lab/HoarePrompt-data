Output State: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `cur_ss` remain unchanged; `i` is `k`; `tmp` is the last character at position `i` in the alphabet where `cur & 1 << i == 0`; `ans` is a string consisting of the character at position `k-1` in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times followed by `tmp`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` has been updated to include the character stored in `tmp` at the end of the string. All other variables remain unchanged.
