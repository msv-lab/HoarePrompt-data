The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the variable `cur` by a value that is 1 shifted left by `cur_ss` bits. Given that `cur_ss` is `ord(s[3]) - ord('a')`, the exact value of `cur_ss` depends on the fourth character of the string `s`.

Since the initial state specifies that `cur_ss` is `ord(s[3]) - ord('a')`, and no specific value for `s[3]` is provided, we can't determine a numeric value for `cur_ss`. However, we know that `cur` will be incremented by `2 ** cur_ss`.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `tmp`, `i`, `ans` remain the same as their initial values; `ss` is the fourth element of `s`; `cur_ss` is `ord(s[3]) - ord('a')`; `cur` is incremented by `2 ** cur_ss`.**
