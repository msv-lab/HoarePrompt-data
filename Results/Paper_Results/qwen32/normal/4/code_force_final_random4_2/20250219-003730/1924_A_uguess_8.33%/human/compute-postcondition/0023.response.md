The code snippet calculates the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet by converting it to its ASCII value and subtracting the ASCII value of 'a'. This results in `cur_ss` being an integer between 0 and 25, inclusive.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z').**
