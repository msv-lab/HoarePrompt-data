Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain the same as their initial values. `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` bits in `cur` were all set to `1`, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. `cur` is `0` if the last `k`-bit sequence was complete, otherwise it holds the value of the incomplete sequence.**
