Given the initial state description and the `print` statement provided, we need to determine what will be printed. The `print` statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `tmp`, `i`, `ans`), their states, and some derived values (`cur`, `cnt`, `cur_ss`). However, these variables and their values are not directly used in the `print` statement.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. There is no dependency on the variables described in the initial state for this specific `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
