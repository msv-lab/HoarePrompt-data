The code snippet increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `cnt` is `1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, `ans`, and `cur` remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, `ans` remain unchanged; `cnt` is `1`; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`; `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1` if `(cur & 1 << cur_ss) == 0` was false, otherwise `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`.**
