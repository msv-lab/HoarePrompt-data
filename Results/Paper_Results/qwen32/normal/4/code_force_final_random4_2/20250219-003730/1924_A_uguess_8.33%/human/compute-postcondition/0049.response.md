Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur` are all described as remaining unchanged, but their exact values are not provided.
- `i` is set to `k`.
- `tmp` is set to `chr(ord('a') + (k-1))`, which means `tmp` is a character corresponding to the `k`-th letter in the alphabet (where 'a' is the 1st letter, 'b' is the 2nd, and so on).
- `ans` is updated to `ans + chr(ord('a') + (k-1)) + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`. This means `ans` is appended with the `k`-th letter of the alphabet followed by `n - cnt - 1` number of 'a' characters.

### Analysis:
- The `print(ans)` statement will output the current value of `ans`.
- `ans` is constructed by appending the `k`-th letter of the alphabet followed by `n - cnt - 1` number of 'a' characters to its previous value.

### Output Description:
- The exact value of `ans` cannot be determined because we don't know the initial value of `ans`, the values of `k`, `n`, and `cnt`.
- However, we know that `ans` will end with the `k`-th letter of the alphabet followed by `n - cnt - 1` number of 'a' characters.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the previous value of ans concatenated with the k-th letter of the alphabet followed by (n - cnt - 1) number of 'a' characters)**
