Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged. `cnt` is `1` if `cur` was updated to `(1 << k) - 1`; otherwise, `cnt` remains `0`. `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. `cur` is updated to `(1 << k) - 1` if the initial `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`; otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged or set to `1 << cur_ss` based on the initial condition.**
