### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Length of the string to be formed.
     - `k`: Number of distinct lowercase English alphabets to be used.
     - `m`: Length of the string `s`.
     - `s`: A string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output "YES" if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
   - If the answer is "NO", also print a string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the input values `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`.

2. **Core Logic**:
   - The program uses a bitmask `cur` to track the presence of characters in the current subsequence.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and updates the bitmask `cur` when a new character is encountered.
   - When the bitmask `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` distinct characters have been found in the current subsequence.
   - It increments the count `cnt` whenever all `k` distinct characters are found and resets the bitmask `cur`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `cnt` (count of subsequences with all `k` distinct characters) is at least `n`.
   - If `cnt >= n`, it prints "YES".
   - If `cnt < n`, it prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

4. **String Construction**:
   - The program constructs a string `ans` by appending characters from the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It ensures that the constructed string `ans` is of length `n` and does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Approach**: The program's approach of counting subsequences with all `k` distinct characters is incorrect. It does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
- **String Construction**: The string construction logic is flawed. It does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid counterexample.
- **Bitmask Usage**: The bitmask logic is used incorrectly to determine the presence of all `k` distinct characters, but it does not help in checking all possible strings of length `n`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the program's logic, the program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: False**
