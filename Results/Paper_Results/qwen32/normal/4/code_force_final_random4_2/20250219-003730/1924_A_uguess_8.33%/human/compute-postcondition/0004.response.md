The code snippet provided initializes a variable `cnt` to 0. No other variables are affected or modified by this code. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` are already defined with specific constraints or values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the string read from the input; `cnt` is 0.**
