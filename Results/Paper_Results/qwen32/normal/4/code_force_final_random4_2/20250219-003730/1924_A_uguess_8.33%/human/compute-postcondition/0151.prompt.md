Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains unchanged, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop. `s` remains unchanged as it is only read, not modified. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `cnt` is incremented each time a subset of `k` distinct characters is found in sequence, and `cur` will be 0 if the last processed subset of `k` distinct characters completed a sequence, or it will be a value reflecting the bits of the characters processed since the last completed sequence. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged, `cur` remains unchanged, `i` is set to `k`, `tmp` is set to the character `chr(ord('a') + (k-1))`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + chr(ord('a') + (k-1)) + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, and `tmp` remain the same as their initial values. `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` bits in `cur` were all set to `1`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `cur` is `0` if the last `k`-bit sequence was complete, otherwise it holds the value of the incomplete sequence. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `k`, `tmp` is the last character set in the loop or unchanged, and `ans` is updated to `ans + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `cur_ss` remain unchanged. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program continues without modifying `i`, `tmp`, and `ans`. Otherwise, `i` is set to `k`, `tmp` is set to the last character at position `i` in the alphabet where `cur & 1 << i == 0`, and `ans` is updated to a string consisting of the character at position `k-1` in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then followed by `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
