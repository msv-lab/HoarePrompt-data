You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: The output consists of `t` lines. Each line is either "YES" if the number of sequences of `k` distinct characters in `s` is at least `n`, or "NO" followed by a constructed string `ans` if it is not.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks if a given string contains at least `n` sequences of `k` distinct characters. It outputs "YES" if the condition is met. If not, it outputs "NO" followed by a constructed string that contains `cnt` sequences of `k` distinct characters plus additional characters to reach a total of `n` sequences.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires checking if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabits occur as subsequences in the string `s`. If not, we need to provide one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.

2. **Counting Subsequences:**
   - The program uses a bitmask to track the presence of subsequences.
   - `cur` keeps track of the current bitmask of characters encountered.
   - `cnt` counts how many times all `k` characters have been encountered in order (i.e., a full bitmask of `1 << k - 1`).

3. **Checking for Subsequences:**
   - For each character in `s`, it updates the bitmask `cur`.
   - If `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`, it means a new valid subsequence of length `k` has been found, and `cnt` is incremented.
   - The program checks if `cnt` is at least `n`. If it is, it prints "YES".

4. **Finding a Missing Subsequence:**
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, it prints "NO".
   - It then tries to construct a string of length `n` that is missing as a subsequence.
   - The construction logic seems flawed. It attempts to create a string by appending characters that haven't been encountered yet, but the logic doesn't guarantee a correct missing subsequence.

### Key Issues:
- The program does not correctly determine if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`. The bitmask logic is used to count the presence of subsequences of length `k`, not `n`.
- The logic for constructing a missing subsequence is incorrect. It does not ensure that the constructed string is a valid missing subsequence of length `n`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with both checking for subsequences and constructing a missing subsequence, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program incorrectly counts subsequences and fails to properly construct a missing subsequence.
Correctness: **False**
