Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases and constraints specified in the problem description. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of suitable permutations is flawed, particularly in how it handles the placement of prefix and suffix maximums.

Here are some issues with the program:
1. The condition `if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1]):` is too simplistic and does not cover all cases where the permutation is invalid. For example, it does not account for the possibility of overlapping prefix and suffix maximums in other positions.
2. The program does not properly calculate the number of ways to arrange the elements between the given prefix and suffix maximums. The multiplication logic for `ans` is not fully correct and may miss some valid permutations or count invalid ones.
3. The program does not handle the case where there are no prefix or suffix maximums correctly.
4. The program assumes that the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum must be the same, which is correct, but it does not ensure that there are no other conflicts between the given prefix and suffix maximums.

A correct solution would need to carefully account for all possible valid permutations that satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximum conditions, which involves more complex combinatorial logic and careful handling of overlaps and constraints.
