Postcondition: **`N`, `M1`, `M2` are integers, `L` and `R` are lists of integers with the last element of `L` equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M1` is less than or equal to 1, `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last second element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. If `M2 > 1`, then after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `N`, `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - 2*N + 4` if `M1 > 1`, otherwise it remains `-1`, `cur` will be incremented each time `i == R[cur]` is true up to the end of `R`, and `ans` will be updated each time `i != R[cur]` is true, multiplying `ans` by `nums_left` and taking modulo `MOD`. If `M2` is not greater than 1, then there are no changes to `i`, `nums_left`, `cur`, or `ans`.**
