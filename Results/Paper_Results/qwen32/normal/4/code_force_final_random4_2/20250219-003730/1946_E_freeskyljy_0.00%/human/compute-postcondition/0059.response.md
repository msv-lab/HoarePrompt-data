The code snippet provided updates the value of `ans` based on its current value, `nums_left`, and `MOD`. The new value of `ans` is the result of the expression `ans * nums_left % MOD`.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the variable `ans`. The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged, and the preconditions `N > 3` and `i < N - 1` are still valid.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 3, and `i` must be less than `N - 1`; `ans` is updated to `(ans * nums_left) % MOD`.**
