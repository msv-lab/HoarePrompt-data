The provided Python code snippet is `cur -= 1`, which means the value of `cur` is decreased by 1.

Given the initial state, `cur` is initially set to either `M1 - 4` or `M1 - 3` depending on whether `i` is equal to `L[cur]`. Since the code snippet only decrements `cur` by 1, we adjust the value of `cur` accordingly.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 4, `M1` and `M2` are integers obtained from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last second element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `M1` is greater than 1. If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` and `cur` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`. `cur` is now `M1 - 5` if `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is `M1 - 4`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`. `i` is `N - 3`.**
