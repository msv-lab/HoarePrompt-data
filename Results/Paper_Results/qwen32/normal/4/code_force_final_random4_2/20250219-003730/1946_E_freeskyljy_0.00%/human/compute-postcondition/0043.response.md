To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop, we need to ensure that the condition `i < N` is satisfied. The variables `i` and `N` are the only ones that can be adjusted according to the loop head.

Given the conditions:
1. `i` is `N + 1` if `M1` is not greater than 1.
2. `i` is 2 if `M1` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `N`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `N`.

- If `M1` is not greater than 1, `i` is `N + 1`, which does not satisfy `i < N`. Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to a value less than `N`.
- If `M1` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, which might or might not satisfy `i < N` depending on the value of `N`. If `N` is greater than 2, then `i = 2` satisfies `i < N`. If `N` is less than or equal to 2, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `N`.

Since we need to ensure the loop can execute at least once, we should adjust `i` to a value less than `N` in all cases where `i` is not already less than `N`.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- If `M1` is not greater than 1, set `i` to a value less than `N` (e.g., `i = 1`).
- If `M1` is greater than 1 and `N` is less than or equal to 2, set `i` to a value less than `N` (e.g., `i = 1`).

Since the task specifies adjusting only the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `i` and `N`. The simplest adjustment that works for all cases is to set `i` to 1 (assuming `N` is at least 2).

State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `M1`, `M2` are integers, `L` and `R` are lists of integers with the last element of `L` equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M1` is less than or equal to 1, `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last second element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `M2` is greater than 1. If `M1` is greater than 1, then `i` is 2, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - N + 2`, and `ans` is `final_computed_ans`. If `M1` is not greater than 1, then there are no changes to `i`, `nums_left`, `cur`, or `ans`. `nums_left` is `-1` if `M1` is not greater than 1. `cur` is 1. `i` is 1.**

This ensures that `i < N` is satisfied, allowing the loop to execute at least once.
