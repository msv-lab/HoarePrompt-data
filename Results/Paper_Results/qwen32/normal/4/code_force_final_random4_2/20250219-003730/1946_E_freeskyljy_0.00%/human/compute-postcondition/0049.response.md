Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `M1` and `M2` are integers, `L` and `R` are lists of integers with the last element of `L` equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M1` is less than or equal to 1, `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last second element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `M2` is greater than 1. If `M1` is greater than 1, then `i` is 2, and `nums_left` is `L[-1] - N + 2`. If `M1` is not greater than 1, then `i` is 1, and `nums_left` is -1. `cur` is 2 if `i == R[cur]` is true, otherwise `cur` is 1. If `i == R[cur]` is true, `ans` remains `final_computed_ans`. If `i == R[cur]` is false, `ans` is updated to `(ans * nums_left) % MOD`. `nums_left` is decreased by 1.**

In simple terms: The variable `nums_left` has been decreased by 1. All other conditions and variable states remain the same as described in the initial state.
