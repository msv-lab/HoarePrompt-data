Each test case consists of three integers n, m_1, and m_2 (1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively. The next line contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{m_1} (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order. The following line contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{m_2} (1 ≤ s_i ≤ n) representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order. It is guaranteed that the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
