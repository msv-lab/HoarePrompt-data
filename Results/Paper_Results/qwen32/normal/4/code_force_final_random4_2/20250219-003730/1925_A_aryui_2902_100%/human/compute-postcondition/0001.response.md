The code snippet provided initializes a string variable `s` with the value `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `k` as they are not modified by the code. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `t`, `n`, and `k`, while `s` is now initialized to the alphabet string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `s` is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`**.
