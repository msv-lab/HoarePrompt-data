### Reasoning:
The given program is supposed to construct a string such that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are present in the string. The program provided does not achieve this goal.

The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` for each test case and constructs a string by repeating the first `k` letters of the alphabet `n` times. This approach does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in the resulting string.

For example, consider the case where `n = 2` and `k = 2`. The function will return `'aabb'`. However, the string `'aabb'` does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using the characters 'a' and 'b'. Specifically, it does not contain the subsequences `'ba'`.

The correct approach would involve constructing a De Bruijn sequence for the given `n` and `k`, which is a cyclic sequence in which every possible string of length `n` appears as a substring. However, the provided program does not implement this or any other correct strategy to generate the required string.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
