To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code snippet on the given variables. The code snippet assigns the result of the function call `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to the variable `ret`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot determine the exact value of `ret`. However, we know that `ret` will hold whatever value `func_1` returns when called with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments.

The values of `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them, which is not indicated in the given code snippet. Therefore, we can conclude that `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`introverts` is a non-negative integer, `extroverts` is a non-negative integer, `universals` is a non-negative integer, `ret` is the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**.
