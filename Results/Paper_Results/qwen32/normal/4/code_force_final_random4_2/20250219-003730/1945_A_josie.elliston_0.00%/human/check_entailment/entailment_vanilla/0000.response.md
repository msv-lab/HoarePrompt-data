Let's go through the problem and the provided code step by step to determine the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert wants to live alone in a tent. Thus, for `a` introverts, we need exactly `a` tents.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Hence, for `b` extroverts, we need `b / 3` tents if `b` is divisible by 3. If `b % 3 != 0`, it means there will be some extroverts left over who cannot form a complete group of three.
3. **Universals (c)**: Universals are flexible and can live alone, with one other person, or with two others. They can be used to fill the gaps left by introverts and extroverts to form complete groups.

### Key Points

- If `b % 3 != 0`, then we need to check if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to complete the tents.
- The number of tents required for extroverts and universals is calculated by `(b + c) / 3` rounded up, if possible.
- If `b % 3 != 0` and the remainder plus the number of universals is less than 3, it's impossible to form a valid tent arrangement, and we should return `-1`.

### Code Analysis

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. It checks if the remainder of extroverts when divided by 3 can be paired with universals to form complete tents. If not, it returns `None`.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function calculates the total number of tents by adding the number of tents needed for introverts (`a`) to the result of `func_1`. If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to form valid tents, and `func_2` returns `-1`.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's go through the first example provided in the problem statement:

**Input:** `1 2 3`
- **Introverts (a)**: 1
- **Extroverts (b)**: 2
- **Universals (c)**: 3

1. `func_1(2, 3)` is called.
   - `2 % 3 != 0`, so we check if `2 % 3 + 3 < 3`, which is `2 + 3 < 3` or `5 < 3`, which is `False`.
   - Therefore, we calculate `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = ceil(5 / 3) = 2`.
2. `func_2(1, 2, 3)` is called.
   - `ret = func_1(2, 3) = 2`.
   - Since `ret` is not `None`, we return `1 + 2 = 3`.

The output for this test case is `3`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents required while respecting the preferences of introverts, extroverts, and universals. If it's impossible to form valid tents, it correctly returns `-1`.

**Correctness: True**
