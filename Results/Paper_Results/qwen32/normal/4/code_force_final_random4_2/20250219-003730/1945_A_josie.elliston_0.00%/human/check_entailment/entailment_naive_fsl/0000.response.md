Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code fails to account for scenarios where the number of universals is insufficient to pair with extroverts to meet their requirement of being in a tent with two others.

Let's analyze the code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the number of extroverts can be perfectly grouped into tents of three. If not, it checks if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to complete a tent.
   - However, the logic `if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` is incorrect. It should check if the remaining extroverts can be paired with enough universals to complete the tents. For example, if `extroverts % 3 == 1` and `universals == 1`, it should still be possible to form a tent with the remaining extrovert and the universal.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calls `func_1` and adds the number of introverts to the result. If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1`.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the input `a=0`, `b=1`, `c=1`:
- According to the problem statement, one extrovert and one universal can share a tent, so the expected output is `1`.
- However, `func_1(1, 1)` will return `None` because `1 % 3 + 1 < 3` is `False`, and thus `func_2(0, 1, 1)` will return `-1`, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
- The code should ensure that the number of extroverts can be paired with enough universals to form complete tents of three.
- Additionally, it should handle cases where the number of universals is not sufficient to pair with extroverts, resulting in an impossible scenario.

### Corrected Code Example:
```python
from math import ceil

def min_tents(a, b, c):
    # Tents for introverts
    tents = a
    
    # Tents for extroverts
    extroverts_left = b
    while extroverts_left > 0:
        if extroverts_left >= 3:
            tents += 1
            extroverts_left -= 3
        elif extroverts_left == 2:
            if c >= 1:
                tents += 1
                extroverts_left -= 2
                c -= 1
            else:
                return -1
        elif extroverts_left == 1:
            if c >= 2:
                tents += 1
                extroverts_left -= 1
                c -= 2
            else:
                return -1
    
    # Tents for remaining universals
    tents += ceil(c / 3)
    
    return tents

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    t = int(input[0])
    idx = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(input[idx])
        b = int(input[idx + 1])
        c = int(input[idx + 2])
        idx += 3
        results.append(min_tents(a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected code properly handles all edge cases and ensures that the number of tents is calculated correctly according to the problem statement.
