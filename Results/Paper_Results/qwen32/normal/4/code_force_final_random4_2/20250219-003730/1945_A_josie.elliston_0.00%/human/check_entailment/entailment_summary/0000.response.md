Reasoning:

To solve the problem, we need to ensure that all participants can be accommodated according to their preferences, and we want to find the minimum number of tents required. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program should work:

1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert requires their own tent, so we need at least `a` tents for introverts.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others, meaning that for every group of three extroverts, we need one tent. If `b` is not a multiple of 3, we need to accommodate the remaining extroverts (either 1 or 2) with some universals.
3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can be placed in any tent configuration. They are used to fill in the gaps if there are leftover extroverts who need to be paired with others.

The function `func_1` seems to handle the logic for accommodating extroverts and any additional universals needed to form complete groups of three for the extroverts:
- If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts and the available universals can form a group of three. If not, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts.
- If it's possible to form groups, it calculates the number of tents needed for these groups and any leftover extroverts by dividing the total (extroverts + universals) by 3 and taking the ceiling of the result.

The function `func_2` then combines the number of tents needed for introverts with the result from `func_1`:
- If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts, so `func_2` returns -1.
- Otherwise, it returns the sum of the tents needed for introverts and the tents needed for extroverts and universals.

Given the problem description and the provided execution summaries, the logic in both functions appears to be correct. The program correctly handles the conditions for forming groups and checks for impossibilities, returning the correct number of tents or -1 when it's not feasible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

Correctness: **True**
