Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is updated based on the value of `el` where it is reduced by 1 if `el` is '>'; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, and the last element is removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing elements that are accumulated sums of positions of '<' characters, starting with a single element `0` and updated by adding `i + 1` if `el` is '<'; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is updated based on the conditions provided. If `el` is '>', `preOne` has its last element removed, and `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` if `ol <= zr`, otherwise `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`. If `el` is '<', `suffZero` is updated by adding `i + 1`, and `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr <= ol`, otherwise `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`. `n` must be greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` and `zr` are updated based on the value of `el` and the conditions provided; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the values of `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, and `suffZero`; `fi` is calculated based on the values of `ol`, `zr`, and `preOne`. `i` is `k - 1`; `el` is `s1[i]`.**
