To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the line of code on the existing variables. The key part of the code is the calculation of `zeroInd` using the function `func_1`. However, since `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, we will assume it behaves as a standard function that takes a list and an index, and returns an element from that list based on the index provided.

Given:
- `suffZero` is a list containing the elements `[0, i + 1]`
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`
- `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1` and `zr` is greater than `ol`

Let's break down the calculation of `zeroInd`:

1. `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)`: Since `ol` is `totalOne`, and `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre`, and `pre` contains the positions of '>' characters, `ol + 1` will be an index that is out of bounds for `suffZero` if `totalOne` is greater than 0. However, since `zr` (which is `len(suffZero) - 1`) is greater than `ol`, we can assume `ol + 1` is within the bounds of `suffZero` for the sake of this calculation. Let's assume `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` returns `suffZero[ol + 1]`.

2. `func_1(suffZero, 1)`: This will return `suffZero[1]`, which is `i + 1`.

So, `zeroInd` can be calculated as:
`zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[ol + 1] - suffZero[1]`

Given `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`, we have:
- `suffZero[ol + 1]` is `i + 1` (since `ol + 1` is 1 if `ol` is 0, and `suffZero` has 2 elements).
- `suffZero[1]` is `i + 1`.

Therefore:
`zeroInd = 2 * (i + 1) - (i + 1) = i + 1`

Now, we can update the output state with the new value of `zeroInd`:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list containing the elements `[0, i + 1]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>', and `el` is not '>'; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `i + 1`.**
