You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided code to see if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Grid and Pinball Movement**:
   - The grid consists of cells containing either '<' or '>'.
   - When a pinball is placed on a cell, it moves according to the character in that cell.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid (either the left or the right side).

2. **Queries**:
   - For each cell `i` (from 1 to n), we need to determine how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the grid when placed on that cell.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Multiple test cases.
   - The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5.

### Provided Code Analysis

The provided code uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1(arr, times)`**:
   - This function seems to be designed to calculate a difference based on the accumulated values in `arr`. It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at a specific index calculated based on `times`.

2. **Function `func_2(s1, n)`**:
   - `s1` is the string representing the grid, and `n` is the length of the grid.
   - It initializes `pre` to store the indices of '>' characters.
   - `preOne` is an accumulated version of `pre`, and `suffZero` is used to store cumulative sums related to '<' characters.
   - The function iterates over the grid from right to left, calculating the number of seconds it takes for a pinball starting at each cell to leave the grid based on the accumulated values and the logic involving `func_1`.

### Correctness

The logic in `func_2` seems overly complex and not directly intuitive for solving the problem of determining the number of seconds for a pinball to leave the grid. The problem can be solved more straightforwardly by simulating the movement of the pinball for each starting position and keeping track of the number of moves until it leaves the grid.

The provided code does not directly simulate the pinball movement and instead relies on a more abstract mathematical approach. Given the complexity and the lack of clear documentation or explanation of the logic, it's difficult to verify its correctness without running extensive tests.

However, based on the problem constraints and the fact that the code does not seem to follow a typical simulation approach, it is likely that the code is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not seem to correctly simulate the pinball movement and calculate the required number of seconds for each starting position in a straightforward manner. Therefore, it is unlikely to be correct for all possible inputs within the given constraints.
