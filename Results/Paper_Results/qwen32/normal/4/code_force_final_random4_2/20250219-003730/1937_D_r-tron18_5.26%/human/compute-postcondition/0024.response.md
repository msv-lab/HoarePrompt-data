Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list containing the elements `[0, i + 1]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>', and `el` is not '>'; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The variables `ol` and `zr` have been assigned new values. `ol` is set to the value of `totalOne`, and `zr` is set to the length of `suffZero` minus 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
