arr is a list of strings where each string consists of characters '<' and '>', and times is a list of integers where each integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) represents the length of the corresponding string in arr. The length of arr and times are equal, and the sum of all n in times does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
