The code appends the value of `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to the `suffZero` list. Given that `suffZero` initially contains a single element `0`, the new element will be `0 + i + 1`, which simplifies to `i + 1`.

Therefore, the `suffZero` list will now have two elements: `[0, i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list containing the elements `[0, i + 1]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>', and `el` is not '>'**
