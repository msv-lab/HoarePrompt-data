Let's analyze the given information step by step to understand what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement.

### Initial State:
1. **`s1`**: This variable remains unchanged, but its value is not explicitly given.
2. **`pre`**: This is an empty list.
3. **`totalOne`**: This is initialized to 0.
4. **`preOne`**: This is an empty list.
5. **`suffZero`**: This list contains cumulative sums of positions of '<' characters in `s1`. Since the exact value of `s1` is not provided, the exact values in `suffZero` are not determinable, but we know it is based on the positions of '<' characters in `s1`.
6. **`ans`**: This list contains updated values based on loop conditions, but the exact values are not provided in the initial state.

### The `print(*ans)` Statement:
The `*` operator in the `print(*ans)` statement unpacks the list `ans` and prints each element separated by spaces.

### Analysis:
Since the exact state of `ans` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `ans`. The values in `ans` are determined by the loop conditions, which are not detailed in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot provide a specific numerical output, but we can describe the output in terms of the contents of `ans`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans`, separated by spaces. Since the exact values in `ans` are not provided, we describe the output in terms of the contents of `ans`.

Output: **the elements of the list `ans` (where `ans` is a list of values determined by the loop conditions)**
