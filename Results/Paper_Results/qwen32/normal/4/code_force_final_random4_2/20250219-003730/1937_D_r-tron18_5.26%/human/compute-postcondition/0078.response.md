To determine the output state, we need to calculate the new value of `zeroInd` based on the given expression. The expression for `zeroInd` is:

\[ \text{zeroInd} = 2 \times \text{func\_1}(\text{suffZero}, \text{ol} + 1) - \text{func\_1}(\text{suffZero}, 1) \]

Given the initial state, the variables `suffZero`, `ol` (which is `totalOne`), and the function `func_1` need to be considered. However, since `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, we will assume that `func_1` is a function that returns a specific value based on its arguments. Without the definition of `func_1`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `zeroInd`. But we can express `zeroInd` in terms of `func_1` and the provided variables.

The other variables (`s1`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `n`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `oneInd`, `fi`, `i`) remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code snippet, which they are not in this case.

Therefore, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is updated based on the value of `el` where it is reduced by 1 if `el` is '>'; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, and the last element is removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing elements that are accumulated sums of positions of '<' characters, starting with a single element `0` and updated by adding `i + 1` if `el` is '<', with the latest element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is updated based on the conditions provided; `n` must be greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`; `oneInd` and `fi` are calculated based on the values of `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, and `suffZero`; `i` is `k - 2`; `el` is `s1[i]`.**

In simpler terms, the only change is the calculation of `zeroInd` using the function `func_1` with the specified arguments. All other variables remain unchanged.
