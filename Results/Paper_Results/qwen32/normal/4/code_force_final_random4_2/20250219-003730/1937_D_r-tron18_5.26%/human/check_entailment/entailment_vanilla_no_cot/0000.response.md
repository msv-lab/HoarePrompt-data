Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a complex and non-intuitive approach involving prefix and suffix accumulations, which does not seem to correctly simulate the pinball movement and inversion rules as described in the problem statement. The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` is not straightforwardly related to the problem's requirements, and there are no comments explaining the intended purpose of each part of the code. To ensure correctness, the program should simulate the pinball movement step-by-step for each starting position, taking into account the inversion of the characters after each move. The given program does not do this and thus is incorrect.
