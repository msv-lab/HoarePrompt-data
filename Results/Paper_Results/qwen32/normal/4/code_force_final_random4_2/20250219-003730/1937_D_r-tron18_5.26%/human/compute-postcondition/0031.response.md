The code snippet `oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]` calculates the value of `oneInd` by doubling the last element of the list `preOne`. 

Given the initial state:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` is a list containing the elements `[0, i + 1]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>', and `el` is not '>'.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `zeroInd` is `i + 1`.

The only variable that changes is `oneInd`, which is set to `2 * preOne[-1]`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0; `suffZero` is a list containing the elements `[0, i + 1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `n` must be greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>', and `el` is not '>'; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `i + 1`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.**
