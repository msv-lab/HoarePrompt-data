Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, we need to determine the new state after executing the line `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1`.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is an integer greater than 0
- `b` is greater than 0
- `c` is the second integer from the user's input
- `d` is the new input string
- `e` is the value of the user's input
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 4
- `k` is set to `e.index(d[j]) + 1` if `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, otherwise `k` is set to `j`
- The loop or if statement is broken out of if either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`

The line `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1` will update the value of `k` based on the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1. Since `j` is 4, we need to find the index of `d[4]` in `e` and add 1 to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `k` is `e.index(d[4]) + 1`**

In natural language: The value of `k` is updated to the index of the character `d[4]` in the string `e` plus 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
