Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is the value of the user's input; `j` is incremented by 1; `k` is equal to the incremented value of `j`.**

In natural language: The value of `k` is now equal to the incremented value of `j`, while all other variables retain their previous values and constraints.
