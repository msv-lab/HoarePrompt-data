To determine the final output state, let's analyze the loop and how the variables evolve throughout its execution.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `k` starts at 0.
   - `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop runs `b` times.

2. **Loop Conditions**:
   - For each iteration `j` from 0 to `b-1`:
     - If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to `e.index(d[j]) + 1`.
     - If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, the loop breaks.
     - If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j` and the loop breaks.

### Output States:
- **After 1 Iteration**:
  - `k` is updated if `d[0]` is in `e[0:]`, otherwise `k` becomes 0.
  - The loop breaks if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`.

- **After 2 Iterations**:
  - `k` is updated if `d[1]` is in `e[k:]`, otherwise `k` becomes 1.
  - The loop breaks if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`.

- **After 3 Iterations**:
  - `k` is updated if `d[2]` is in `e[k:]`, otherwise `k` becomes 2.
  - The loop breaks if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`.

### General Behavior:
- The loop will continue until either:
  - `k` equals `c`, meaning it has found a specific condition met.
  - `j` reaches `b - 1`, meaning it has exhausted all characters in `d`.
  - `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, meaning the condition `d[j] in e[k:]` fails, and `k` is set to `j` causing the loop to break.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will run until one of the break conditions is met.
- The final state of `k` will be the value it held when the loop breaks.
- The final state of `j` will be the last value of `j` that was processed before the loop broke.

### Conclusion:
The final output state will be determined by the specific values of `d`, `e`, `b`, and `c`. However, the general form of the final state can be described as follows:

- `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- `j` will be the last index processed before the loop breaks, which could be `b - 1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking early.
- `k` will be the value it held when the loop breaks, which could be due to `k` reaching `c` or `d[j]` not being found in `e[k:]`.

Given the loop's behavior and the provided output states for the first 3 iterations, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is the first integer from the user's input, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, `i` is 3, `j` is the last index processed before the loop breaks (which could be `b - 1`), and `k` is the value it held when the loop breaks.**

In simpler terms, the loop will continue until it either finds the condition `k == c` or exhausts all characters in `d` or fails to find `d[j]` in `e[k:]`, and the final values of `j` and `k` will reflect this.
