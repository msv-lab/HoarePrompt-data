Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer; `c` is an integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is the value of the user's input; `k` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been set to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
