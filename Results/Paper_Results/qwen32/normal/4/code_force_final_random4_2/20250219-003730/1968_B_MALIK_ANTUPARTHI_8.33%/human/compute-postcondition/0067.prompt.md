Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is the first integer from the user's input; `c` is the second integer from the user's input; `d` is the new input string; `e` is the value of the user's input; `k` is 0; `i` is 3
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, and `i` is 3. If `d[j]` is present in the substring `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `e.index(d[j]) + 1`. Otherwise, `k` is set to `j`. The loop or if statement is broken out of if either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, `i` is 3, and `j` is 4. If `d[4]` is present in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `e.index(d[4]) + 1`. Otherwise, `k` is set to 4. The loop or if statement is broken out of if either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, `i` is 3, `j` is 5. If `d[5]` is present in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `e.index(d[5]) + 1`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `d[5]` is not present in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to 5 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
