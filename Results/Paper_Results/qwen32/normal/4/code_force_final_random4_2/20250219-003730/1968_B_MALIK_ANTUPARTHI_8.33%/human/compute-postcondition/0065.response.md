Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `k` is 5 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the current loop or if statement without changing the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain the same as they were in the initial state. The only change is that the loop or if statement is broken out of.
