The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the return value of `func_10()`. Since the loop has just finished an iteration, the return value of `func_10()` must have been at least 1 to allow the loop to execute. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0 again.

Given that the state of `n` and `m` are not directly related to the loop's continuation, and `func_15()`'s return value has been printed but is not part of the loop condition, we only need to focus on `func_10()`'s return value.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` must return a positive integer, a positive integer value returned by `func_15()` has been printed to the standard output. `func_10()` will return a value greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.**
