To determine the output state, we need to calculate the new value of `ans` based on the given code snippet and the initial state.

Given:
- Initial State: `n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `ans` is `n + 1 + (n + 2) // 4`

The code snippet:
```python
ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
```

Calculating the new value of `ans`:
1. First, calculate the initial value of `ans`:
   \[
   \text{ans} = n + 1 + \left\lfloor \frac{n + 2}{4} \right\rfloor
   \]
2. Then, calculate the additional value to be added to `ans`:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i \times i} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{n + 3}{3 \times 3} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{n + 3}{9} \right\rfloor
   \]
3. The new value of `ans` is:
   \[
   \text{ans} = \left(n + 1 + \left\lfloor \frac{n + 2}{4} \right\rfloor\right) + \left\lfloor \frac{n + 3}{9} \right\rfloor
   \]

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified but it must be at least 6, we can express the final `ans` in terms of `n`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `ans` is `n + 1 + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`**

In natural language: The value of `ans` is updated to be the sum of its initial value (`n + 1 + (n + 2) // 4`) and the additional value (`(n + 3) // 9`). The values of `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged.
