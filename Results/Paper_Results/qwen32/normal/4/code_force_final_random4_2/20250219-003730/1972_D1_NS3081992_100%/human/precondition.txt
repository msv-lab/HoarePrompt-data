The function `drank` is not correctly defined according to the problem description. The correct function should take two integers `n` and `m` as input parameters for each test case. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6). The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.
