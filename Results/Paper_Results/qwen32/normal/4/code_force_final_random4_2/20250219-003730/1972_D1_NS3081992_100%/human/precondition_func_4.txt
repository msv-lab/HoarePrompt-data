This function does not utilize any parameters and does not provide any context about the variables n and m. However, based on the problem description, we can infer that n and m are positive integers representing the upper bounds for the values of a and b in the ordered pairs (a, b). The function `func_5` is likely used to read input from standard input, but it does not directly relate to the variables n and m in its signature.
