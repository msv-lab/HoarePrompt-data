You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple containing the coefficients `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and the GCD `g`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not directly implement the required logic to solve the problem described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

The code provided includes several utility functions (func_1 to func_16) that perform various tasks such as reading input, computing the greatest common divisor (gcd), and other operations, but the specific logic to solve the problem is not clearly present.

The function `func_15` seems to be the main function that attempts to solve the problem, but it does not correctly implement the required logic. The loop inside `func_15` calculates a sum based on the condition, but it does not correctly account for all pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given condition.

To verify the correctness, let's consider the first example provided in the problem description:

- For n = 1 and m = 1, the only pair is (1, 1). Here, a + b = 2 and b * gcd(a, b) = 1. Since 2 is a multiple of 1, the pair (1, 1) satisfies the condition. The function should return 1.

- For n = 2 and m = 3, the pairs that satisfy the condition are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). The function should return 3.

However, the function `func_15` does not correctly compute these results for these test cases or others. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To make the program correct, the logic inside `func_15` needs to be revised to properly iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and count those that satisfy the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).
