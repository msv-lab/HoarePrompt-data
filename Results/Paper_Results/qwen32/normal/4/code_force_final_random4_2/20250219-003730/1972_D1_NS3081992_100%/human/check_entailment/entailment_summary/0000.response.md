### Reasoning:
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Let's break down the provided functions and see if they collectively meet the problem requirements:

1. **Input Reading Functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, `func_8`, `func_9`, `func_10`, `func_11`)**:
   - These functions are primarily responsible for reading input from standard input. They read integers, lines, and lists of integers from the input. They are correctly implemented for reading the input as per the problem description.

2. **GCD Calculation Function (`func_13`)**:
   - `func_13` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This is a standard and correct implementation of the GCD function.

3. **Irrelevant Functions (`func_12`, `func_14`)**:
   - `func_12` and `func_14` are not relevant to the problem at hand. They seem to be related to graph traversal or some other unrelated problem.

4. **Main Calculation Function (`func_15`)**:
   - `func_15` calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) for a given n and m. It iterates through possible values of i and checks the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). The implementation provided in `func_15` is not directly correct for the problem. It seems to be attempting to solve a different problem or has a logical error. The correct approach involves iterating over possible values of b and then over possible values of a for each b, checking the condition.

5. **Execution Function (`func_16`)**:
   - `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case, printing the result. This part is correct if `func_15` were correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem due to the incorrect implementation of `func_15`. The logic in `func_15` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
