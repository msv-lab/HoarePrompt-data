The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not represent any state that needs to be adjusted. However, the loop's continuation depends on the value returned by `func_10()`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `func_10()` must return a positive integer for the loop to continue executing. Since `func_10()` returned a positive integer for the previous iteration, we can assume it will do so again for the next iteration unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted in terms of the loop head variables. The only requirement is that `func_10()` continues to return a positive integer.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` must return a positive integer, a positive integer value returned by `func_15()` has been printed to the standard output**
