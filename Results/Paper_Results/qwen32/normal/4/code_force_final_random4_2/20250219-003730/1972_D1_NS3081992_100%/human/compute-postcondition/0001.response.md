Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` must return a positive integer, a positive integer value returned by `func_15()` has been printed to the standard output.**

The code snippet `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` prints the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character to the standard output. The initial state of `n` and `m` remains unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code snippet provided. The function `func_10()` is mentioned to return a positive integer, but it is not directly involved in the provided code snippet, so its state remains as described in the initial state.
