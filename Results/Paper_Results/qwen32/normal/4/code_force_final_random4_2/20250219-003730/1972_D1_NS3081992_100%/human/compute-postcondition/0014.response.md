Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. It calculates and returns the sum of the series `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9 + ... + (n + i_final) // (i_final * i_final)`, where `i_final` is determined by the condition that `(i_final * i_final) <= m`.**
