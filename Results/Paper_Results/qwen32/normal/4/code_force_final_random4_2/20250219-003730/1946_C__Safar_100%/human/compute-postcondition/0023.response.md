Postcondition: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is an empty set, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is 0, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, and `x` is in the `visited` set. Additionally, `x` is equal to 1. Since there is no else part, the state remains unchanged if `x` is not equal to 1.**
