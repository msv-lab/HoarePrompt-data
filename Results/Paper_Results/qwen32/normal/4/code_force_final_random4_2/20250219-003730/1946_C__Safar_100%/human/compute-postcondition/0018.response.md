Postcondition: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree where `g[1]` must have at least two elements, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is either `[(1, 1)]` or `[(1, 1), (node, 1)]` depending on whether `node` is equal to `p` or not, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is 0, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, and `x` is in `visited`. If `node` is not equal to `p`, `stack` is updated to include `(node, 1)` at the end.**
