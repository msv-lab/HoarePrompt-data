Postcondition: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree where `g[1]` must have at least one element, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is 0, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, and `x` is in `visited`. Additionally, `node` is not equal to `p`.**
