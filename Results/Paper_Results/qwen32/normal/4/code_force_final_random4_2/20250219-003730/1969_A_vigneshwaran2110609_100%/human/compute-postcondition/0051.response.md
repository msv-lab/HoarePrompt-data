The code snippet sets `flag` to `True` regardless of its previous value. Therefore, `flag` is now `True`. The other variables (`i`, `l`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `flag` is `True`, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input, and `x` is greater than `i_prev + 1`**.
