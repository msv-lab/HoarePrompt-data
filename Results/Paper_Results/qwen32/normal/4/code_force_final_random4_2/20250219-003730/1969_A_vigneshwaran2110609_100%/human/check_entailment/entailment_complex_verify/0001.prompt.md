You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n].
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: The loop prints `3` a total of `n` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it determines and prints either `2` or `3` based on whether there exists an index `i` such that `p[p[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`. If such an index exists, it prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp must send so that at least 2 friends attend the party. A friend will attend if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.

### Key Observations:
1. If there is a pair of friends (i, j) such that i is the best friend of j and j is the best friend of i (i.e., `p_i = j` and `p_j = i`), then sending invitations to both friends will ensure both attend.
2. If no such pair exists, Monocarp must invite at least 3 friends to ensure at least 2 attend (since inviting 2 friends might not guarantee both of their best friends are also invited).

### Code Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
```

1. The outer loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, `x` (the number of friends) is read.
3. The list `l` contains the best friends of each friend.
4. The inner loop checks if there exists a pair of friends (i, j) such that `p_i = j` and `p_j = i`. This is checked by `if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`.
5. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
6. If no such pair is found after the loop, it prints `3`.

### Issues in the Code:
1. The variable `flag` is set but never used. This is not a critical issue but is unnecessary.
2. The logic for checking if there exists a pair of mutual best friends is correct, but the code does not handle the case where there are multiple such pairs efficiently.
3. If a pair is found, the code correctly prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
4. If no pair is found, the code correctly prints `3`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations required. It correctly identifies if there exists a pair of mutual best friends and handles the case where no such pair exists. The code does not have any logical errors based on the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **True**
