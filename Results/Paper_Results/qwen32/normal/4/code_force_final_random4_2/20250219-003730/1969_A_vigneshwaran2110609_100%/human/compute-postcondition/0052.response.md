The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print(2)
```

The value to be printed is explicitly provided as the integer `2`. The initial state describes several variables (`i`, `flag`, `l`, `x`, and `i_prev`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Output: **2**
