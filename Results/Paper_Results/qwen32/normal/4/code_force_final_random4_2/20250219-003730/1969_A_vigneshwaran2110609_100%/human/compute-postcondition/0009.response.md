Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n]; `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1` for some index `i`, then `flag` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.**
