Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, and `i` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input value, `first_row` is the first character of the input value in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the input value in `a`, `i` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements (the original input and the newly appended input), `first_row` is the concatenation of the original `first_row` and the first character of the last element in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a` repeated twice, `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing three elements (the original input, the newly appended input, and the new input), `first_row` is the concatenation of the original `first_row`, the first character of the newly appended input, and the first character of the new input, `last_row` is the last character of the new input repeated three times, `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
