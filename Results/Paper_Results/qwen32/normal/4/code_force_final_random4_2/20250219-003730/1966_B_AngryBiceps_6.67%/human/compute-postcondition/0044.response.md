Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is the result of `input()`), `first_row` is the first character of each element in `a` concatenated together, `last_row` is the last character of each element in `a` concatenated together, `i` is 0.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `a` will contain `n` strings, each obtained from consecutive `input()` calls. The string `first_row` will be composed of the first characters of each string in `a`, and the string `last_row` will be composed of the last characters of each string in `a`. The loop variable `i` will be 0, indicating that the loop has completed all `n` iterations. The values of `t` and `m` remain unchanged as they were initially provided.
