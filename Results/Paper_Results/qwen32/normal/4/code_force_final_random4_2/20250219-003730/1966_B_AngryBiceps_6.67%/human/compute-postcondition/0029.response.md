The code snippet provided is `a = []`, which reassigns the variable `a` to an empty list. This change impacts the variable `a` directly, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each input string concatenated together, `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each input string concatenated together, `i` is `n`.**
