The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to the `last_row` string. Given the initial state, `a` contains one element which is the result of `input()`, and `last_row` is initially an empty string. After executing the code, `last_row` will contain the last character of that single element in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing one element (the result of `input()`), `first_row` is the first character of the last element in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a`, `i` is `n`.**
