Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is the result of `input()`), `first_row` is the first character of each element in `a` concatenated together, `last_row` is the last character of each element in `a` concatenated together, and `i` is 0. If the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1 and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, the condition is met as per the if part. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not 1 or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`, as per the else part.**
