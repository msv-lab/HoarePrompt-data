The code snippet assigns an empty string to the variable `first_row`. This change affects `first_row` directly, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is the last character of each element in the original `a` concatenated together, and `i` is 0.**
