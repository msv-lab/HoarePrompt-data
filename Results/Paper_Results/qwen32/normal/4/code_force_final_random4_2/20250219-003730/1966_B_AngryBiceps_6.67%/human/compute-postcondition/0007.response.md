The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the `first_row` string. Since `a` contains only one element which is the input string, `a[-1]` refers to that single string. Therefore, `a[-1][0]` is the first character of the input string. The value of `first_row` is updated to this character, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input string, `first_row` is the first character of the input string, `last_row` is an empty string**.
