The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the existing value of `first_row`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `a` is a list containing three elements (the first element is the result of the first `input()`, the second element is the result of the second `input()`, and the third element is the result of the third `input()`)
- `first_row` is the first character of the last element in `a` repeated twice
- `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a` repeated twice
- `i` is 1

After executing `first_row += a[-1][0]`, `first_row` will now contain the first character of the last element in `a` repeated twice, followed by the first character of the last element in `a` once more.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list containing three elements (the first element is the result of the first `input()`, the second element is the result of the second `input()`, and the third element is the result of the third `input()`); `first_row` is the first character of the last element in `a` repeated three times; `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a` repeated twice; `i` is 1**.
