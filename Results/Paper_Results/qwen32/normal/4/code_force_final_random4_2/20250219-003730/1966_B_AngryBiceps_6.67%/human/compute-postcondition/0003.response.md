Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `a` is an empty list; `first_row` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The variable `first_row` is initialized as an empty string. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, and `a`) are not modified by the code snippet, so their initial states remain unchanged.
