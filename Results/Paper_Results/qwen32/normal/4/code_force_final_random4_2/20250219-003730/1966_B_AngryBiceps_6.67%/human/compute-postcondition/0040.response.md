The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 1. The condition `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, but for the loop to continue, `n` should be at least 1 more than the current `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements (the first element is the result of the first `input()`, and the second element is the result of the second `input()`), `first_row` is the first character of the last element in `a` repeated twice, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a` repeated twice, `i` is 1**
