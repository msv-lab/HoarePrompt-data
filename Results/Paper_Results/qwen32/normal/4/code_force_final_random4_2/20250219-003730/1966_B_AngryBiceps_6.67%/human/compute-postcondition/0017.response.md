Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input string, `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each input string concatenated together, `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each input string concatenated together, `i` is `n`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `n` and `m` remain the integers they were initially.
- `a` is a list that now contains all `n` input strings.
- `first_row` is a string formed by concatenating the first character of each input string.
- `last_row` is a string formed by concatenating the last character of each input string.
- The loop variable `i` will have the value `n` after the loop completes.
