Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `tree[current]` is a non-empty list, `queue` is a deque not containing the first `unvisited_node` tuple that was popped, `visited` is a set containing all nodes reachable from `start` and includes `unvisited_node`, `current` is the first value of the popped tuple from `queue`, and `dist` is the second value of the popped tuple from `queue`. Additionally, `neighbor` is not in `visited` and is now added to `visited`.**

In natural language: The variable `visited` now includes the `neighbor` node, which was not previously in the set. All other variables retain their initial state values.
