The code snippet appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that the `queue` will now include the new tuple representing the `neighbor` node and its distance from the `start` node, which is `dist + 1`.

The other variables (`start`, `target`, `tree`, `visited`, `current`, and `dist`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `tree[start]` must have at least one neighbor, `queue` is a deque containing the previous elements and the new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `visited` is a set containing `start` and `neighbor` and possibly other elements, `current` is equal to `start` or another node, `dist` is a non-negative integer, and `current` is not equal to `target`. `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]` that has not yet been processed in this iteration.**
