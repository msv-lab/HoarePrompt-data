Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `tree[start]` must have at least one neighbor, `queue` is a deque containing an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `neighbor`, and possibly other elements, `current` is equal to `start` or another node, `dist` is a non-negative integer, and `current` is not equal to `target`. `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor of `current`.**

In natural language: The `queue` now includes an additional tuple consisting of the `neighbor` and the distance `dist + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial conditions provided.
