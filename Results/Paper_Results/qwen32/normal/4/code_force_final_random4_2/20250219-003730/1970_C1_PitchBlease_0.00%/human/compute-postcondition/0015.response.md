Postcondition: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `tree[start]` must have at least one neighbor, `queue` is a deque, `visited` is a set containing `start` and possibly other elements, `current` is equal to `start` or another node, `dist` is a non-negative integer, and `current` is not equal to `target`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `neighbor` is added to `visited` and the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is appended to `queue`.**
