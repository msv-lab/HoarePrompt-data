Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree, `queue` is a deque not containing the first `unvisited_node` tuple that was popped, `visited` is a set containing all nodes reachable from `start` and does not include `unvisited_node`, `current` is the first value of the popped tuple from `queue`, and `dist` is the second value of the popped tuple from `queue`. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns `dist`. Otherwise, the program does not return a value.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `tree[current]` is a non-empty list, `queue` is a deque. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` contains the newly added tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` includes `unvisited_node` and `neighbor`. If `neighbor` is in `visited`, `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged. `current` is the first value of the popped tuple from `queue`, and `dist` is the second value of the popped tuple from `queue`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `tree[current]` is a non-empty list with at least one more unprocessed neighbor, `queue` includes the new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`, `visited` includes `unvisited_node` and `neighbor` from the previous iteration and now also includes `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`, `current` is the first value of the popped tuple from `queue`, and `dist` is the second value of the popped tuple from `queue`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `tree[current]` is a non-empty list with at least one more unprocessed neighbor, `queue` includes the new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`, `visited` includes `unvisited_node` and `neighbor` from the previous iteration and now also includes `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`, `current` is the first value of the popped tuple from `queue`, and `dist` is the second value of the popped tuple from `queue`. `neighbor` is the next unprocessed neighbor in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` was not in `visited`, the `queue` now includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` as its last element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
