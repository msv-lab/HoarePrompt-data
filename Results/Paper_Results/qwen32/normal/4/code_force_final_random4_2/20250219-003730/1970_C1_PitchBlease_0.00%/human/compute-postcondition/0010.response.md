Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `tree[start]` must have at least one neighbor, `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `visited` is a set containing the single element `start` and possibly other elements including `neighbor`, `current` is equal to `start` or another node, `dist` is a non-negative integer, `current` is not equal to `target`, and `neighbor` is in `visited`.**

In this output state, the `queue` now contains a tuple with the `neighbor` and the incremented distance `dist + 1`. The `visited` set now includes the `neighbor`. All other variables remain unchanged in terms of their descriptions.
