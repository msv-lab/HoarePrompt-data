n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, edges is a list of n-1 tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge in the tree with 1 <= u, v <= n, and start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, such that 1 <= start <= n. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
