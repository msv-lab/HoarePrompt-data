Output State: **`queue` is not empty and may or may not contain an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start`, including `neighbor`. `current` is the first element of the tuple removed from the queue and is a key in `tree` with `tree[current]` having at least two elements. `dist` is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue. `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]` that has not yet been processed.**

In simpler terms, `neighbor` has been added to the `visited` set, which now includes all previously reachable nodes from `start` plus `neighbor`. All other variables remain unchanged.
