Postcondition: **`queue` is not empty, `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start`, including `neighbor` if it was not already visited, `current` is the first element of the tuple removed from the queue and is a key in `tree` with `tree[current]` having at least two elements, `dist` is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue, `neighbor` is the next unprocessed element in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` was not in `visited`, `queue` contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` includes `neighbor`.**
