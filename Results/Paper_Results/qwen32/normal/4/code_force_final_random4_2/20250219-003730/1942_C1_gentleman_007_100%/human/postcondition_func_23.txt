The function `func_24` performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from a given vertex `ver` in a graph. It marks all reachable vertices from `ver` as visited by setting the corresponding entries in the `vis` list to 1. The function prints each visited vertex in the order they are visited. The graph structure and the unvisited vertices remain unchanged after the function execution.
