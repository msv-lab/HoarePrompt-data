Postcondition: **`ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` and is a valid index in `graph`. `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least one element. `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise. `q` has had its leftmost element removed. If `vis[node]` was 0, `q` now includes `node` as its newest element and `vis[node]` is 1. If `vis[node]` was already 1, `q` remains unchanged and `vis[node]` remains 1.**
