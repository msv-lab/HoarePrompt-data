To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop. The loop condition is `while len(q)`, which means the loop will continue as long as the queue `q` is not empty.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q`.
- `graph` remains unchanged.
- `vis` has 1s for all nodes that were adjacent to `ver` and were not previously visited.
- `q` has all newly visited nodes appended to it.

For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `q` still contains at least one element.

### Steps to Adjust the State:
1. **Ensure `q` is not empty**: At the end of the previous iteration, `q` had all newly visited nodes appended to it. To ensure the loop can execute again, `q` must still have at least one element. This means we need to ensure that at least one new node was added to `q` during the previous iteration.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q`, `graph` remains unchanged, `vis` has 1s for all nodes that were adjacent to `ver` and were not previously visited, and `q` must contain at least one element.**

This ensures that the condition `len(q)` is still true, and the loop can proceed with another iteration.
