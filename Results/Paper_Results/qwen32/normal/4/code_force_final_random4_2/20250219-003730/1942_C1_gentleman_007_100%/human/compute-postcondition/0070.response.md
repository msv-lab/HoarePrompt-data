Postcondition: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a)` and `j` from 0 to `len(b)`. The final value `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b`. `i` is `len(a) - 2` and must be greater than 0. If `dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]`, then `j` remains `len(b) - 1` and `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `j` is `len(b) - 2` and `l` is a list containing `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`.**
