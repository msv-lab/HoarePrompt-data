#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_24` performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from a given vertex `ver` in a graph. It marks all reachable vertices from `ver` as visited by setting the corresponding entries in the `vis` list to 1. The function prints each visited vertex in the order they are visited. The graph structure and the unvisited vertices remain unchanged after the function execution.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from a given vertex `ver` in a graph represented by `graph`. It modifies the `vis` list to mark all vertices reachable from `ver` as visited by setting their corresponding entries to 1. The function does not return a value but updates the `vis` list in place.
