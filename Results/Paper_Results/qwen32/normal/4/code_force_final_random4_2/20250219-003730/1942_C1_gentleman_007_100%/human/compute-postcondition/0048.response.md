Postcondition: **`ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation; `graph` remains unchanged; `vis` has 1s for all nodes that were adjacent to `ver` and were not previously visited, including `node` if `vis[node]` was False; `q` contains the elements that were originally in `q` excluding the first element, with `node` appended to the end if `vis[node]` was False; `node` is the next unprocessed node in `graph[ver]`.**
