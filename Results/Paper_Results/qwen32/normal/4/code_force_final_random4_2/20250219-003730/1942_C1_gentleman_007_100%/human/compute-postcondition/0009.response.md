The code snippet `vis[node] = 1` sets the value of `vis[node]` to 1, indicating that the node has been visited. The values of the other variables (`ver`, `graph`, `vis` for indices other than `node`, and `q`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least one adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, with `vis[ver]` set to 1 and `vis[node]` set to 1, and `q` is a deque containing the node. The current node is such that `vis[node]` is 0 before the code execution and is now set to 1.**
