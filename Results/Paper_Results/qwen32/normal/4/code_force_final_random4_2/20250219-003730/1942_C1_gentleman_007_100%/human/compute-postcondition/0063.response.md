Postcondition: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a)` and `j` from 0 to `len(b)`. The final value `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b`. `i` is `len(a)` and must be greater than 0, `j` is either `len(b)` or `len(b) - 1` and must be greater than 0. `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `j` is `len(b) - 1`. Otherwise, if `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, `j` is `len(b)` and `l` contains `a[i]` if `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`.**
