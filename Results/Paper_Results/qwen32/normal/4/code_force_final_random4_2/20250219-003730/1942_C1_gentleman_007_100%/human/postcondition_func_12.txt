The function accepts an integer `n` greater than or equal to 2 and returns a dictionary representing the prime factorization of `n`. The annotated code suggests a specific example where `n` is factored into `{2: 3, 3: 3}`, but the function is designed to handle any integer `n` and return its correct prime factorization.
