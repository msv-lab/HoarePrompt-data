Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a)` and `j` from 0 to `len(b)`. The final value `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b`. `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(b)`, `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while i != 0 and j != 0:
    if dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]:
        j -= 1
    elif dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
        i -= 1
    else:
        i -= 1
        j -= 1
        l.append(a[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a)` and `j` from 0 to `len(b)`. The final value `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b`. `i` is `len(a)` and must be greater than 0, `j` is either `len(b)` or `len(b) - 1` and must be greater than 0. `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `j` is `len(b) - 1`. Otherwise, if `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, `j` is `len(b)` and `l` contains `a[i]` if `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a)` and `j` from 0 to `len(b)`. The final value `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b`. If `dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1` and `j` is `len(b) - 2`. Otherwise, `i` is `len(a) - 2` and `j` is either `len(b) - 1` or `len(b) - 2` depending on whether `dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]`. `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]` or `a[i + 1]`, and in some cases, it may contain both `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]`. `i` is `len(a) - 2` or `len(a) - 3` or `len(a) - 4`, and `j` is `len(b) - 3` or `len(b) - 4` or `len(b) - 2`. `l` is either an empty list, a list containing `a[i]`, a list containing `a[i + 1]`, or a list containing both `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`. If `dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]`, then `j` is specifically `len(b) - 4` or `len(b) - 3`. If `dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is specifically `len(a) - 3` or `len(a) - 4` and `j` is `len(b) - 3` or `len(b) - 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
