Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + k - 1`, `ans2` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i]`, and `i + x` is less than `n`.**
