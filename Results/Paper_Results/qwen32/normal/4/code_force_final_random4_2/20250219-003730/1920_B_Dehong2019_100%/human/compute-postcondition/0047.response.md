The code snippet provided modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from it. Given the initial state, we need to update `ans1` accordingly.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0
- `n` is an integer read from input
- `k` must be greater than 0
- `x` is an integer read from input
- `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order
- `i` is `x + k - 1`
- `ans2` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`
- `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i]`
- `i + x` is less than `n`

After executing `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2`, the value of `ans1` is updated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + k - 1`, `ans2` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i] - 2 * a[i + x]`, and `i + x` is less than `n`.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans1` is reduced by twice the value of the element at index `i + x` in the list `a`.
