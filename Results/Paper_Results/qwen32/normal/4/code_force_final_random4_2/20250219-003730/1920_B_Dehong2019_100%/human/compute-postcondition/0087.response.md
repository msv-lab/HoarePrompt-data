To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

Initial State: `i` is 1; `ans1` is increased by `a[1]`

The code snippet is:
```
ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
```

Here, `i` is 1, so the expression `i + x` becomes `1 + x`. This means `ans1` will be decreased by `a[1 + x] * 2`.

The value of `x` is not specified, so we'll keep it as `x` and express the final state in terms of `x`.

The initial state tells us that `ans1` was initially increased by `a[1]`, so we can express the initial value of `ans1` as `ans1_initial = some_value + a[1]`. After the code execution, `ans1` will be `ans1_initial - a[1 + x] * 2`.

Since `ans1_initial` is `some_value + a[1]`, we can substitute it back:

`ans1` after execution = `(some_value + a[1]) - a[1 + x] * 2`

But since we only know that `ans1` was increased by `a[1]` initially, we can simplify this to:

`ans1` after execution = `ans1 (initial state) - a[1 + x] * 2`

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans1` is `ans1 (initial state) - a[1 + x] * 2`**
