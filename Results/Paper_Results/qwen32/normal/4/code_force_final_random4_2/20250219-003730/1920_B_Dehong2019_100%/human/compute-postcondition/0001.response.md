The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer `t` represents the number of test cases to follow. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. After executing the code, the value of `t` is updated to the integer value read from the input, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4.**
