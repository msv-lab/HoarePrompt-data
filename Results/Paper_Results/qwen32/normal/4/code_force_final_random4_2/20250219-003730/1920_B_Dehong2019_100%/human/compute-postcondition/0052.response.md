The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from it. Given the initial state, we need to update `ans1` accordingly.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0
- `n` is an integer read from input
- `k` must be greater than 0
- `x` is an integer read from input
- `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order
- `i` is `x + k - 2`
- `ans1` is calculated as `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 2 * a[i] - 2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i]`
- `ans2` is `max(ans1, ans2)`

After executing the code snippet `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2`, the new value of `ans1` will be:
- If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` was initially `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 2 * a[i] - 2 * a[i + x]`. After the operation, `ans1` becomes `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 2 * a[i] - 4 * a[i + x]`.
- If `i + x` is not less than `n`, `ans1` was initially `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i]`. After the operation, `ans1` remains unchanged since `a[i + x]` does not exist, and the operation `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` does not apply.

Thus, the updated `ans1` is:
- `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 2 * a[i] - 4 * a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`
- `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i]` if `i + x` is not less than `n`

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + k - 2`, `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 2 * a[i] - 4 * a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i]`, `ans2` is `max(ans1, ans2)`**
