Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `k` is the second integer read from the new input, `x` is the third integer read from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `2x + k - 2`, `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[x + k - 1] + a[x + k] + ... + a[2x + k - 2])`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, `_` is incremented by `x`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    ans1 += a[i]
    if i + x < n:
        ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
    ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is the third integer read from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `2x + k - 2`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `sum(a) - 2 * (a[x + k - 1] + a[x + k] + ... + a[2x + k - 2])`, `_` is incremented by `x`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[x + k - 1] + a[x + k] + ... + a[2x + k - 2]) + a[i] - 2 * a[i + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` is not updated.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is the third integer read from the new input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `2x + k - 1`, `_` is incremented by `x`, `ans1` is updated to `sum(a) - 2 * (a[x + k - 1] + a[x + k] + ... + a[2x + k - 2]) + a[i] - 4 * a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[i] - 2 * a[i + x]`, `ans2` is the maximum of the old `ans1` and the new `ans1` as calculated.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1; `ans1` is `ans1 (initial state) - a[1 + x] * 2` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1 (initial state) + a[1]`; `ans2` is `max(ans1 (new value), ans2 (initial state))`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
