In the given task, the for loop will iterate `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1, as the loop will run from 0 to `t-1`.

Let's analyze the objects in the loop head:
- `_` is a throwaway variable that does not need to be adjusted.
- `t` is the variable that determines how many times the loop will execute.

Since `t` is already provided as an integer read from input and is guaranteed to be between 1 and 10^4, the only thing we need to ensure is that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The state of `t` does not need to be adjusted if it is already within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4**
