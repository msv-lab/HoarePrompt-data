Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The logic used in the program does not accurately reflect the constraints and requirements of the problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the increasing prices of tickets over time as more tickets are purchased on earlier days.

To correctly solve this problem, a more appropriate approach would involve using a greedy algorithm or dynamic programming to minimize the total cost while respecting the constraints on the number of tickets that can be purchased per day and the price increases over time.

Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:
1. Use a priority queue (min-heap) to always purchase tickets on the day with the lowest current price.
2. Track the cumulative cost and the number of tickets purchased.
3. Adjust the prices for subsequent days as tickets are purchased.
4. Repeat until all required tickets are purchased.

The provided code does not implement this logic and instead makes incorrect assumptions about the optimal way to purchase tickets, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
