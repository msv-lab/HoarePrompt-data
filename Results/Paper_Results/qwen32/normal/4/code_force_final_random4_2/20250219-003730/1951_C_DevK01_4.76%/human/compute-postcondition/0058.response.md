The function `func` accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5`, `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9`, and `1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)`. Additionally, it accepts a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific value based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It returns a value determined by the constraints provided, which is not explicitly detailed in the output description.**
