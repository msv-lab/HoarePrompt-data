Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `n` is `L[0]`; `m` is `L[1]`; `k` is `L[2]`.**

In this output state, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` have been updated to hold the values of the first three elements of the list `L`, respectively. The other variables and their initial conditions remain unchanged.
