The code snippet `w = N.pop()` removes the last element from the list `N` and assigns it to the variable `w`. Given the initial state, `N` is `M[:q]`, which means `N` is a sublist of `M` containing the first `q` elements of `M`.

After the `pop` operation, the list `N` will have one less element, and the variable `w` will hold the value of the last element that was removed from `N`.

Output State: **`M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `t` is `t`; `n` is `len(N)`; `m` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `k`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed; `w` is the last element of the original `N`.**
