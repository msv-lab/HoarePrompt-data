The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `L`. This operation does not affect the initial variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
