The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration only. It does not change any variables or states directly. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `m` is `min(m, k)`, `k` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is `L[1]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`. If `n * m == k`, `N` is `M[:q]` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is `M[:q-1]` excluding the last element that was popped, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, `w` is the last element that was popped from `N`, and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

In simple terms, none of the variables have changed their values or states as a result of the `continue` statement.
