Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `m` is `min(m, k)`, `k` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is `L[1]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`. If `n * m == k`, `N` is `M[:q]` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is `M[:q-1]` excluding the last element that was popped, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, `w` is the last element that was popped from `N`, and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**
