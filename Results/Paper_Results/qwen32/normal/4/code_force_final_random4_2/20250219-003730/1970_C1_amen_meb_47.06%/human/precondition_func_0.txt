n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n representing the edges of the tree, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1 where 1 <= u_1 <= n, representing the starting node of the game.
