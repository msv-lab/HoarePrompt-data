The code snippet provided takes the second element of the `nums` list, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `num2`. Given that `nums` is a list containing the string representation of `u_1` and `u_1` is the starting node of the game, the second element of `nums` is actually the same as the first element, which is the string representation of `u_1`.

Therefore, `num2` will be assigned the integer value of `u_1`, which is also the value of `num1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n representing the edges of the tree, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1 where 1 <= u_1 <= n, representing the starting node of the game. `numbers` is a list containing the sublist `[num1, num1]`. `nums` is a list containing the string representation of `u_1`. `num1` is the integer value of `u_1`. `num2` is the integer value of `u_1`.**
