Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a new input string, `kq1` is the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is the string representation of `x`, `vt` is not 0, `q` is `q + 1`, `x` is the smaller integer value between `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the larger integer value between `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**

Natural Language: The variable `kq2` now holds the string representation of the smaller integer value between `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. All other variables retain their initial values.
