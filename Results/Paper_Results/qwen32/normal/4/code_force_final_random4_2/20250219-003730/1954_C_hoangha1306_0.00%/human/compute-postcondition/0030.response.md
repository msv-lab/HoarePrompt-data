The code snippet provided is `kq2 = kq2 + a[i]`, which appends the character `a[i]` to the string `kq2`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `a` is a non-empty string.
- `b` is an input string.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the character `a[i]`.

The code modifies `kq2` by concatenating `a[i]` to it. Therefore, the new value of `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` with `a[i]` appended.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the character `a[i]`, `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with the character `a[i]`.**

In simpler terms, `kq2` now includes the character `a[i]` appended to it, while all other variables remain unchanged.
