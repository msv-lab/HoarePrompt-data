Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a new input string, `q` is `q + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is `kq1` + `a[i]`, `kq2` is `kq2` + `a[i]`, `vt` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
