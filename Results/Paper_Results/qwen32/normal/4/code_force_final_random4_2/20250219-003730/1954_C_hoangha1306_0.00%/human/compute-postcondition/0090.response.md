Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `kq1` has been updated to its previous value plus the character at index 1 of string `a`, `kq2` has been updated to its previous value plus the character at index 1 of string `a`.**

In natural language: The value of `kq2` is now the previous value of `kq2` plus the character at index 1 of string `a`. All other variables remain unchanged with their respective initial conditions.
