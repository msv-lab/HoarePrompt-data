The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the variable `kq1`. Given that `i` is 1, the character at index 1 of string `a` is added to `kq1`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `kq1` has been updated to its previous value plus the character at index 1 of string `a`.**
