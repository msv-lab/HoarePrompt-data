The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + str(x)` appends the string representation of `x` to the existing value of `kq1`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a new input string, `q` is `q + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is the smaller integer value between `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the larger integer value between `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq1` is the original `kq1` concatenated with `str(x)`, `kq2` is unchanged, `vt` is 1.**
