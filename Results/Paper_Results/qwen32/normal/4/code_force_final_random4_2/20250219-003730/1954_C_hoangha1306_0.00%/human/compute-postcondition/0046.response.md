The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables or their values directly. It simply moves the control to the next iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `kq1`, and `kq2` are affected as follows:
- `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).
- `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + a[i]`.
- `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + a[i]`.

Since `continue` does not alter the state of the variables other than what is explicitly stated in the code snippet, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is `kq1` + `a[i]`, `kq2` is `kq2` + `a[i]`**.
