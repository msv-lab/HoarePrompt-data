Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a new input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 1, `q` is `q + 1`. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`. `x` is the smaller integer value between `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, which is `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the larger integer value between `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, which is `int(a[i])`.**
