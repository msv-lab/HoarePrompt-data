Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `y`, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is not equal to 0, and the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are not equal; `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

In simpler terms, `kq1` now contains the string representation of `y`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
