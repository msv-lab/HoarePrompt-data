Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `vt` is 1. If `a[i] > b[i]`, `kq1` is concatenated with `str(x)` and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(y)`. Otherwise, `kq1` is concatenated with `str(y)` and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)`.**
