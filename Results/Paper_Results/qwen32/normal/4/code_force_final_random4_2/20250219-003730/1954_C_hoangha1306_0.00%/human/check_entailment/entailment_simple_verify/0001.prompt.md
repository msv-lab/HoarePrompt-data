You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program aims to maximize the product of two integers `x` and `y` by swapping corresponding digits if they are different. The logic is based on the idea that for maximizing the product, larger digits should be placed in the higher significant positions.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` as strings.
3. It initializes two empty strings `kq1` and `kq2` to build the resulting numbers.
4. It also initializes a variable `vt` to keep track of whether we have swapped digits for the first time.
5. It iterates over the digits of `a` and `b`:
   - If the digits at the current position `i` are the same, it appends them to `kq1` and `kq2` without any changes.
   - If the digits are different, it finds the minimum and maximum of the two digits.
     - If `vt` is `0` (indicating that no swap has happened yet), it swaps the digits in such a way that the larger digit goes to `kq1` and the smaller to `kq2`. This sets the precedence for future swaps.
     - If `vt` is `1` (indicating that a swap has already happened), it continues to swap the digits in the same manner as the first swap, ensuring consistency in which number gets the larger digit.
6. It prints the resulting numbers `kq1` and `kq2`.

The logic generally appears correct, but there is a flaw in the logic that affects the correctness of the solution. The key issue is that the program only swaps digits in the first position where they differ and then continues to swap in the same direction for subsequent differing positions. This does not guarantee the maximum product because the optimal strategy involves considering all digits and making swaps that maximize the overall product, not just the first differing position.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
98
12
```
The program would output:
```
91
18
```
However, the optimal output should be:
```
92
18
```
or
```
98
12
```
since no swaps are needed to maximize the product.

Thus, the program does not always produce the correct output for maximizing the product of `x` and `y`.
