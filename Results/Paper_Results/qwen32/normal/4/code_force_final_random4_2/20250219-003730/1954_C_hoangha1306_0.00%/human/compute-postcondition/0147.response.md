Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a new input string, `q` is `q + 1`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the character at index `i` of `a` and `vt` remains 0. Otherwise, `x` is the smaller integer value between `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the larger integer value between `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. If `vt` was initially 0, it is now 1, and `kq1` is the string representation of `y` if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, otherwise `kq1` is the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `x` if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, otherwise `kq2` is the string representation of `y`. If `vt` was not initially 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.**
