The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to the variable `kq1`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `q`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[1]` and `b[1]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[1]` and `b[1]`, `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `y`.**
