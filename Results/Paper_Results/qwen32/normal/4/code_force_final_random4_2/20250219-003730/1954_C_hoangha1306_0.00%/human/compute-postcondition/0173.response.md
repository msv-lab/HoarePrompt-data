Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a new input string, `q` is `q + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is the smaller integer value between `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the larger integer value between `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `vt` is 1. If `a[i] > b[i]`, then `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with `str(x)` and `kq2` is `kq2` concatenated with `str(y)`. Otherwise, `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with `str(y)` and `kq2` is `kq2` concatenated with `str(x)`**
