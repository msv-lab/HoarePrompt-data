To determine what will be printed by the `print(start_year)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the relationships between the variables.

### Initial State Breakdown
1. `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`: This indicates that `num_tests` has been decremented by 1, but it does not directly affect `start_year`.
2. `n` is an input integer: This is a given integer value, but its exact value is not specified.
3. `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element: This is a list containing integers, and we know it has at least one element.
4. `start_year` is the result of the nested calculation described above: The exact value of `start_year` is not provided directly, but it is derived from some calculation.
5. `x` is `len(nums) - 1`: This is the index of the last element in the `nums` list.

### Analysis
- The variable `start_year` is mentioned to be the result of some nested calculation, but the exact calculation is not provided in the initial state.
- Since the exact calculation for `start_year` is not given, we can only describe `start_year` in terms of the calculation it represents.

### Conclusion
Given the information, we can only describe `start_year` as the result of the nested calculation described in the initial state. We do not have enough information to determine its exact numerical value.

### Final Output
Output: **start_year (where start_year is the result of the nested calculation described above)**
