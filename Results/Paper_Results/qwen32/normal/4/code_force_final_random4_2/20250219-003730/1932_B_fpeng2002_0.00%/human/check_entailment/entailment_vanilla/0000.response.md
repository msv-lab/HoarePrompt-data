Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that:
1. The i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years.
2. The signs must occur sequentially. That is, after the i-th sign occurs, the tribe starts waiting for the (i+1)-th sign from the year following the occurrence of the i-th sign.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps for each test case:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
3. It initializes `start_year` to 0, representing the year before the first sign can occur.
4. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by:
   - Adding 1 to `start_year` to ensure we are starting from the year after the previous sign occurred.
   - Dividing by the periodicity `nums[x]` and adding 1 to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.
   - Multiplying by `nums[x]` to get the actual year of the next occurrence.
5. It prints the final `start_year` after processing all signs.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`
   - `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - Calculation:
     - `start_year = 0`
     - First sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
     - Second sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
     - Third sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
     - Fourth sign: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
     - Fifth sign: `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
     - Sixth sign: `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (matches the expected result)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`
   - `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Calculation:
     - `start_year = 0`
     - First sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2` (incorrect, should be 1)
     - The program logic is flawed here. It should be `start_year = ((start_year) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` rather than `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` to correctly find the next occurrence.

Given the above analysis, the program logic is incorrect for the second test case and likely for others as well.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the year of the n-th sign's occurrence due to an incorrect formula for determining the next occurrence year.

Correctness: **False**
