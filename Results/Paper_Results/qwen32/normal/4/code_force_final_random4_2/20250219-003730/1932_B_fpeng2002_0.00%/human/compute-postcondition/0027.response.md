The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`. This means that `num_tests` has been decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0 after this decrement. Therefore, before the decrement, `num_tests` must have been at least 1.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `num_tests`.

State: **`num_tests` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `start_year` is the result of the nested calculation described above, and `x` is `len(nums) - 1`**
