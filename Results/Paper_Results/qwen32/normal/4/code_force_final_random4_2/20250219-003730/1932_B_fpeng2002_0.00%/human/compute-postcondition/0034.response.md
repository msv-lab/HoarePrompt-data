To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `x` and `nums`.

Given the loop:
```python
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `num_tests` is at least 0 (this variable is not in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).
- `n` is an input integer (this variable is not in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).
- `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input that must have at least 1 element (this list is in the loop head, but its contents do not change with each iteration, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).
- `start_year` is `nums[0]` (this variable is not in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).
- `x` is 0 (this variable is in the loop head and needs to be adjusted).

In the previous iteration, `x` was 0. In the next iteration, `x` will be incremented by 1 to 1. For the loop to continue executing, `x` must be less than the length of `nums`.

State: **`num_tests` is at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is `nums[0]`, `x` is 1**
