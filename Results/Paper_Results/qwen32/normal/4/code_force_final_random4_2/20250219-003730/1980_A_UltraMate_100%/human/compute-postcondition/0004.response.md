The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ans` to 0. No other variables are modified or used in the snippet. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the string provided by the user input, `ans` is 0.**
