Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `t` is incremented by 1, `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` remains unchanged, `s` is a new input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of characters in the new `s`, and if `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is set to `3 * m`. Otherwise, `ans` is `2 * m`, `i` is 'G'.**
