The code snippet `ans += m - hmp[i]` modifies the value of `ans` by adding `m - hmp[i]` to it. Given the initial condition of `ans`, we need to update it accordingly.

If initially `ans` was `k * m + m - hmp[i]` (when `hmp[i] < m`), then after the execution of the code, `ans` becomes:
\[ \text{ans} = (k * m + m - hmp[i]) + (m - hmp[i]) = k * m + 2m - 2hmp[i] \]

If initially `ans` was `k * m` (when `hmp[i] \geq m`), then after the execution of the code, `ans` becomes:
\[ \text{ans} = k * m + (m - hmp[i]) \]

The other variables (`hmp`, `k`, `m`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `k * m + 2m - 2hmp[i]` if `hmp[i] < m`, otherwise `ans` is `k * m + m - hmp[i]`; `hmp` must contain at least one key-value pair, and `i` is the next key in `hmp`.**
