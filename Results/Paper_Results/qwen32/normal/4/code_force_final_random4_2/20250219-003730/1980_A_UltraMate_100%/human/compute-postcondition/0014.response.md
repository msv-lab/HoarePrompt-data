The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the string `p` ('ABCDEFG'). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 'F'. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be the next character in `p`, which is 'G'.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be updated to 'G'.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`, and `ans`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the string provided by the user input, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`, `i` is 'G'. If 'G' is not a key in `hmp`, `ans` is `m`. If 'G' is a key in `hmp`, `ans` is `2 * m`.**
