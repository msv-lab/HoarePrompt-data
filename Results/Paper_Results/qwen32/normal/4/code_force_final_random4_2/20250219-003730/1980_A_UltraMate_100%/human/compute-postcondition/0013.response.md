Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the string provided by the user input, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`, `i` is 'F'. If 'F' is not a key in `hmp`, `ans` is `m`. If 'F' is a key in `hmp`, `ans` is `2 * m`.**
