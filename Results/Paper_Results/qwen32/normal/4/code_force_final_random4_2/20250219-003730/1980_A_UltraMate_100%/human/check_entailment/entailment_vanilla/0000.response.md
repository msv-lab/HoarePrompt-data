Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Understanding:
We need to determine the minimum number of new problems Vlad needs to create to have `m` rounds, where each round requires exactly one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. 

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It then reads a string `s` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.

2. **Counting Existing Problems**:
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Missing Problems**:
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of new problems needed.
   - It iterates over all possible difficulty levels ('A' to 'G').
     - If a difficulty level `i` is not present in the `Counter` (i.e., `i not in hmp`), it adds `m` to `ans` because `m` rounds require `m` problems of that difficulty level.
     - If a difficulty level `i` is present but has fewer than `m` problems (`hmp[i] < m`), it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing each test case, it prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of new problems needed.

### Verification Against the Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case (10 1 BGECDCBDED)**:
   - Existing problems: `BGECDCBDED`
   - Count: `{'B': 2, 'G': 2, 'E': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 2}`
   - Missing difficulties: 'A', 'F'
   - Problems needed: 1 for 'A' + 1 for 'F' = 2
   - Output: 2 (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case (10 2 BGECDCBDED)**:
   - Existing problems: `BGECDCBDED`
   - Count: `{'B': 2, 'G': 2, 'E': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 2}`
   - Missing difficulties: 'A', 'F'
   - Problems needed: 2 for 'A' + 2 for 'F' = 4
   - Also, 'C' is short by 1, so 1 more problem is needed.
   - Total problems needed: 4 + 1 = 5
   - Output: 5 (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case (9 1 BBCDEFFGG)**:
   - Existing problems: `BBCDEFFGG`
   - Count: `{'B': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 2, 'G': 2}`
   - Missing difficulties: 'A'
   - Problems needed: 1 for 'A' = 1
   - Output: 1 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of new problems needed for each test case based on the given problem description.

**Correctness: True**
