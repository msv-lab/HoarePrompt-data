Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is decremented by 1, `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` remains unchanged, `s` is an input string, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of characters in `s`, `i` is `'B'`. If `'B'` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is set to `2 * m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `0`.**
