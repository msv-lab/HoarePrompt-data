Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` which represents the minimum number of additions needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears in the string at least `m` times.**
