The code snippet provided updates the value of `screen_require_for_y` to be `y // 2 + 1` regardless of the previous condition that determined its value. Here's the output state after executing the code:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input, `n` is decremented by 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `result` is a list containing two elements, the second element being `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` based on the conditions.**

In simpler terms, the value of `screen_require_for_y` is now explicitly set to `y // 2 + 1`. All other variables retain their previous definitions and values.
