The code snippet assigns the value of `y // 2` to the variable `screen_require_for_y`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `y` is even, `y // 2` will be an integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`.**
