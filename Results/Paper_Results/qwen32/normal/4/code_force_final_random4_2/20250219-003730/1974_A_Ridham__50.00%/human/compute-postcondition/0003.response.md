The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `x` and `y`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `result` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is an empty list.**

In simpler terms, `x` and `y` are now assigned specific integer values from the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.
