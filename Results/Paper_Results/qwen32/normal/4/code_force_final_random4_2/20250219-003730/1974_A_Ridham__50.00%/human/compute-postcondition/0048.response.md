Let's break down the code and see how it impacts the variables.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input
- `n` is decremented by 1
- `space_x` is equal to `x`
- `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`
- `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`
- If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2) - space_y`
- If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1` and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - space_y`
- `result` is a list containing two elements, the second element being `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` based on the conditions

The code snippet:
```python
remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
```

Here, `remaining_cells` is being recalculated using the current value of `screen_require_for_y` and `space_y`. 

Let's determine the new value of `remaining_cells`:
- If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`, so `remaining_cells` becomes `15 * (y // 2) - space_y`.
- If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`, so `remaining_cells` becomes `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - space_y`.

Since `space_y` is `y * 4`, we can substitute this into the equation:
- If `y` is even, `remaining_cells` becomes `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4`.
- If `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` becomes `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4`.

Let's put this into the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input, `n` is decremented by 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even or `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd, `result` is a list containing two elements, the second element being `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` based on the conditions.**

In simple terms:
- `remaining_cells` is recalculated based on whether `y` is even or odd.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
