The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `result`. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are not modified by this code. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` within the range 0 to 99. The variable `n` is also an input integer.

Since the code only initializes the `result` list and does not alter the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, or `n`, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the addition of the `result` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is an input integer; `result` is an empty list.**
