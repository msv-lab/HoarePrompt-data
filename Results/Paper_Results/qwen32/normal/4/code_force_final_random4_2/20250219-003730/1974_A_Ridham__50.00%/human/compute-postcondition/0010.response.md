Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, and `y` is an odd integer. `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `screen_require_for_y` has been calculated as `y // 2 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
