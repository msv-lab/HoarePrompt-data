Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is a list containing one element, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is calculated as `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15, or `space_x // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not a multiple of 15.**
