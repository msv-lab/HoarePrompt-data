To determine the output, let's break down the given information and the code snippet:

### Initial State
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input.
- `n` is initialized to 0.
- `result` is a list containing `t` elements, each element calculated based on the logic of the loop.

### Code Snippet
```python
print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Analysis
- The `result` list contains `t` elements, but the specific logic or values of these elements are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the `result` list in terms of its length and that it contains `t` elements.
- The `map(str, result)` function converts each element of the `result` list to a string.
- `'\n'.join(...)` joins these string elements with a newline character, effectively printing each element of the `result` list on a new line.

### Output Description
Since the exact values of the elements in `result` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the structure of the `result` list.

### Final Output
Output: **Each element of the `result` list on a new line (where `result` is a list of `t` elements)**
