Postcondition: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if `r` was never '<', `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input value, `r2` is an input value. If `r` is '=', `prev` is 2 if `r2` is '<', otherwise `prev` remains 0. If `r` is not '=', `prev` remains unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, taking into account the condition `r == '='`. If `r` is '=', `prev` is updated based on the value of `r2`. If `r` is not '=', `prev` remains as it was before the if-else block.
