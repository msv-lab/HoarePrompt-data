The variable `r` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means it will hold the string value provided by the user input. The other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `prev`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` is the input integer greater than 1 still holds. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is 1, `prev` is 0, `r` is the user input string.**
