The code snippet `r = input()` updates the value of the variable `r` to whatever is input by the user. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if `r` was never '<', `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input value. If `r` is '>', `prev` is 1. If `r` is '=', `prev` is 1 if `r2` is '<', otherwise `prev` remains 0.**
