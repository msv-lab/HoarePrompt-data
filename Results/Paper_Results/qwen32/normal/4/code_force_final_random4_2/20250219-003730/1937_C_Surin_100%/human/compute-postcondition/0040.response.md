The code snippet `r2 = input('')` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r2`. This does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state. The values of `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `prev`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is 1, `prev` is 0, and `r` is `'='`; `r2` is the input provided by the user.**
