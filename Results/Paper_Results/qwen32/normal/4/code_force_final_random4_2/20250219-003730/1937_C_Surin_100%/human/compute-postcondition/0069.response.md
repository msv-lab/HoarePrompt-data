Postcondition: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is 3, `r` is the new input string. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is set to 3. If `r` is `'='`, then `r2` is the new input string, and if `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` is set to 3.**
