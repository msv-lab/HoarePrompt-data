To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context of the variables `prev`, `v1`, and `v2`.

From the initial state, we have:
- `kp` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if `r` was never '<'.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `prev` is the final value based on the inputs `r` and `r2` during the iterations.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`v1`**: It is described as the largest `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if `r` was never '<'. Since the exact value of `r` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `v1`. However, we know it could be any integer from 0 to `n-1` based on the condition described.

2. **`prev`**: The description states that `prev` is the final value based on the inputs `r` and `r2` during the iterations. Without the exact code that determines `prev`, we can only say that `prev` is a value derived from the iterations involving `r` and `r2`.

### Conclusion:
Given the information provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `prev` and `v1`. However, we can describe them based on the conditions provided.

Output: **! [prev] [v1] (where [prev] is the final value derived from the iterations involving `r` and `r2`, and [v1] is the largest `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if `r` was never '<')**
