Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was `<` or `0` if no such input was received, `i` is `n-1`, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is `'>'` and `r2` is `'<'`; otherwise, `prev` remains 0 if `r` is `'='` and `r2` is not `'<'`; `r2` is the new user input if `r` is `'='`**

In simpler terms, the new user input is assigned to `r`. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is set to `n-1`. If `r` is `'='`, another user input is taken for `r2`, and `prev` is set to `n-1` if `r2` is `'<'`; otherwise, `prev` remains 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
