The only variable in the loop head is `kp`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `kp` and the user input to `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `kp` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `kp` must be incremented by 1, and the user input to `int(input())` must be greater than the current value of `kp`.

State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was `<` or `0` if no such input was received, `i` is `n`, `prev` is the final value determined by the loop based on user inputs `r` and `r2`.**
