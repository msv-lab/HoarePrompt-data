Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 0.
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
- `g` is 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `v2` is `i + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Identifying `v1` and `v2`**:
   - The variable `v1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state.
   - `v2` is defined as `i + 1`.

2. **Determining the value of `i`**:
   - Initially, the value of `i` is not provided.
   - However, it is mentioned that `i` is updated to `i + 1`. Let's assume the initial value of `i` was `x`. After the update, `i` becomes `x + 1`.
   - Consequently, `v2` becomes `i + 1`, which is `(x + 1) + 1` or `x + 2`.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The print statement is formatted to output a string starting with `?`, followed by the values of `v1`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v2`.
   - Since `v1` is not defined, we will represent it as `[v1]` to indicate that its value is unknown from the given information.
   - `v2` is `x + 2` where `x` is the initial value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `v1` is undefined in the initial state, we can only describe its value as `[v1]`. The value of `v2` is `i + 1`, and since `i` was incremented by 1, `v2` is now `i + 1` or `x + 2` where `x` is the original value of `i`.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] (where v1 is an undefined variable and v2 is i + 1)**

However, since `v2` can be precisely described in terms of `i` after the increment, we can refine it to:

Output: **? [v1] [v1] [i + 1] [i + 1] (where v1 is an undefined variable and i is the updated value of the initial i + 1)**

For clarity and adherence to the format, we can simplify it to:

Output: **? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] (where v1 is an undefined variable and v2 is i + 1)**
