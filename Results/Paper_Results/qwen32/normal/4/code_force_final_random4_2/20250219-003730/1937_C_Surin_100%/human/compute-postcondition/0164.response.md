The code `v2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. Given that `i` is `n-1`, `v2` will now also be `n-1`.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the final value determined by the loop based on user inputs `r` and `r2`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the value provided by the user input. If `r` is equal to '<', the conditions on `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `prev`, `v2`, and `r` remain unchanged.**
