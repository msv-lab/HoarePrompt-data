The code snippet `r2 = input('')` will prompt the user for input and assign that input to the variable `r2`. The other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `prev`, `v2`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest i for which r was '<', or 0 if r was never '<', `i` is 1, `prev` is 0, `v2` is n-1, `r` is '=', `r2` is the input value.**
