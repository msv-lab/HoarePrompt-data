Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 0.
- `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations. Since no iterations are described in the initial state, we assume `v1` has not been updated from its default value, which is typically 0 if it's initialized to 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `prev` is 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- `v1` is described as the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations. Since there are no iterations mentioned in the initial state, `v1` remains 0.
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `prev` is explicitly given as 0.

### Output:
The print statement will format and print the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1` again, and `prev` in the specified format.

Output: **? 0 1 0 0**
