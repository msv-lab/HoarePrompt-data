Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if `r` was never '<', `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input value, `prev` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is reassigned to the value of the input. The values of `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `v2`, and `prev` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the input operation.
