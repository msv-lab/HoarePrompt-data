There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴) representing the length of a permutation p of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. For each test case, the function can make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR operations on pairs of elements in p, and must identify a pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized.
