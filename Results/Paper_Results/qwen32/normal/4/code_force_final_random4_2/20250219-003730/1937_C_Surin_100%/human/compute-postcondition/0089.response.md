The code snippet only includes an input statement, which updates the value of `r` based on the user input. No other variables are affected by this code. The value of `r` will be whatever the user inputs. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input.**
