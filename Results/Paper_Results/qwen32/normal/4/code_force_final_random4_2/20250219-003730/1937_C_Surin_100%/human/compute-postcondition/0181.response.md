The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is used to flush the output buffer. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest i for which r was '<', or 0 if r was never '<', `i` is 1, `prev` is 0, `v2` is n-1, `r` is '='**.
