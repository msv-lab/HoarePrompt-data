The value of `prev` is updated to the current value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is 1, `prev` is 1, `r` is `'>'`.**
