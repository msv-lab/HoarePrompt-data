Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is '.'; `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `d` is an input integer; `b` is an input string that must have at least one character; `s` is set based on the value of `b[j]` plus 1 if `b[j]` is '@', otherwise `s` is set based on the value of `b[j]`; `j` is incremented by 1. If `b[j]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `b` is not empty or if `b[j + 1]` is '*'.**
