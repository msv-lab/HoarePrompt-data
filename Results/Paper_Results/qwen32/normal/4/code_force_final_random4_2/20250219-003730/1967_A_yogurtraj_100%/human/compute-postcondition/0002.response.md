The code snippet takes a list of integers as input, which is split by spaces and converted to a list of integers. The variable `a` is assigned this list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.**
