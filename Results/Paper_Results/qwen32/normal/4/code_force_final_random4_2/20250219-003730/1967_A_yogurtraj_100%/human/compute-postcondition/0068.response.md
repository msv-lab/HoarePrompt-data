The code snippet `r = a[i + 1]` assigns the value of the element at index `i + 1` in the list `a` to the variable `r`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is the first integer provided by the input and must be at least 1
- `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input
- `i` is `ii + 1`
- `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`

The value of `r` is now set to `a[i + 1]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `k` remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer provided by the input and must be at least 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is `ii + 1`, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[i + 1]`**.
