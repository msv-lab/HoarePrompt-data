Let's break down the problem step by step using the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100 (not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `n` is the first integer provided by the input (number of elements in the list `a`).
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input.
- `rem` is initialized to 0.
- `y` is initialized to 0.
- `k` is calculated as `k - sum((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) for i in range(0, n - 1))`. However, the initial value of `k` is not given, so we will assume it is provided or calculated elsewhere in the code.
- `ii` is incremented by `n - 1` from the previous iteration (not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate `r`:**
   - `r` is defined as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.
   - `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.

2. **Calculate the expression inside the print statement:**
   - The expression is `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`.
   - Substitute `r` with `a[n - 1] + k // n`:
     \[
     (a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 + k \% n
     \]
   - Distribute `n`:
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + (k // n) * n - n + 1 + k \% n
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 + k \% n
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 + k \% n
     \]

### Final Output Description:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`, which simplifies to `a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 + k % n`.

Output: **a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 + k % n (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the sorted list `a`, k is a calculated integer, and n is the number of elements in the list `a`)**
