The code snippet calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)` and assigns it to the variable `rem`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions provided in the initial state still hold true.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2; `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the current input; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is 0; `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration; `k` is the second integer provided by the current input; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; and the condition ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k) holds true.**
