Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration. If `k` is not 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n` and `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` if the loop breaks, otherwise 0; `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the loop breaks, otherwise 0. If `k` is 0, then `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `r` is `a[n - 1]`.**
