To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the provided initial state and the formula used in the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` remains the same (not used in the print statement).
- `n` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration (not used in the print statement).
- `k` is not 0.
- `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
- `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` if the loop breaks, otherwise 0 (not used in the print statement).
- `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the loop breaks, otherwise 0 (not used in the print statement).

### Formula in the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Calculate `r`:**
   - `r` is defined as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the list `a`.
   - `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.

2. **Calculate `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`:**
   - First, compute `r - 1`.
   - Then, multiply the result by `n`.
   - Add 1 to the product.
   - Finally, add `k % n` to the sum.

### Explanation of the Output:
- `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the list `a`.
- `k // n` is the integer part of `k` divided by `n`.
- `k % n` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n`.
- The expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n` can be expanded as:
  - `(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`
  - This simplifies to:
  - `(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + k + 1`

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the value of the expression `(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + k + 1`.

Output: **(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + k + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the list `a`, n is the integer `n`, and k is the integer `k`)**
