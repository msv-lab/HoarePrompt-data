Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is `n - 1 - i`; `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, and the precondition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` being greater than `k` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
