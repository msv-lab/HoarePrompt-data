The code snippet `r = a[i + 1]` changes the value of `r` to the element in the list `a` at the index `i + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `a` is a sorted list, `r` will now hold the value of the element at `a[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is an integer provided by the input minus `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `r` is `a[i + 1]`; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; and it is not the case that ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k)**.
