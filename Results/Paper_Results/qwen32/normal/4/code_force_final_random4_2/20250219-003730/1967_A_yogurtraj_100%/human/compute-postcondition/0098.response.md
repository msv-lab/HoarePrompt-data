The code snippet assigns the value `n - 1 - i` to the variable `y`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2; `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the current input; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is `n - 1 - i`; `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration; `k` is the second integer provided by the current input; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; and the condition ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k) holds true.**
