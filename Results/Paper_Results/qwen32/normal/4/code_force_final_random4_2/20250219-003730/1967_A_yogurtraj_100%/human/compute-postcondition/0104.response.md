Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2; `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the current input; `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration. If ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k), then `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `k` is 0, and `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Otherwise, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is the element at index `i + 1` of `a`.**
