Functionality: **The function takes a list of integers representing a permutation and an integer to find within that permutation. It returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the 1-based index of the largest element in the list that is less than or equal to the integer to find, and the second string is the 1-based index of the integer to find in the list. If the largest element less than or equal to the integer to find is the same as the integer to find itself, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints 1.**
