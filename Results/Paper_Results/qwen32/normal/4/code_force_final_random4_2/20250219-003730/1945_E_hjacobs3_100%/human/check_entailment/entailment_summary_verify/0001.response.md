Let's carefully analyze the given program and its behavior based on the problem description and the function summary provided.

### Problem Recap
The task is to rearrange a permutation `p` of size `n` such that after performing a binary search, the element at position `l` is equal to `x`. We can perform at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a permutation `p` and a target number `x`. It then calls `func_1` to determine the necessary swaps.

#### Function `func_1`
- **Inputs**: A list `array` representing the permutation and an integer `find` representing `x`.
- **Outputs**: A list of strings representing the swap operations needed.
- **Logic**:
  1. Initializes `l` and `r` for binary search.
  2. Performs a binary search on the array.
  3. Checks if the element at position `l` is equal to `x`.
  4. If not, it suggests a single swap between `l` and the index of `x` in the array.
  5. If they are equal, it returns an empty list indicating no swaps are needed.

### Issues Identified
1. **Binary Search on Unmodified Array**: The binary search is performed on the original array without any modifications. However, the problem requires rearranging the array using up to 2 swaps so that the binary search ends with `p_l` equal to `x`.
2. **Single Swap Limitation**: The program only suggests a single swap if the binary search does not end with `p_l` equal to `x`. The problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, and the program does not utilize this fact.
3. **Output Handling**: The program prints the number of swaps and the swap operations directly from within `func_1`. This is not the expected behavior since the output should be collected and printed for each test case after processing all test cases.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary describes the function as returning a list of two strings: the 1-based index of the largest element in the list that is less than or equal to `x` and the 1-based index of `x` in the list. It also mentions that if the largest element less than or equal to `x` is the same as `x` itself, it prints `0`; otherwise, it prints `1`.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to rearrange the array using up to 2 swaps so that the binary search ends with `p_l` equal to `x`. The function only suggests a single swap and does not handle cases where multiple swaps are needed. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
