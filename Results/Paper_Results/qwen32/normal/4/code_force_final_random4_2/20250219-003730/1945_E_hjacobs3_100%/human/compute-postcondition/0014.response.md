The `while` loop condition is `r - l > 1`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as the difference between `r` and `l` is greater than 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`.
- `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n).
- `r` must be at least `l + 2`.
- `mid` is the integer value `(l + r) // 2`.
- If `array[mid] <= find`, then `l` is updated to the value of `mid`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to the value of `mid`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `l` and `r` such that `r - l > 1`.

Since `r` must be at least `l + 2` initially, we need to ensure that after any update to `l` or `r`, this condition still holds. The critical aspect is that `r` must be at least 2 units greater than `l`.

Let's consider the two possible scenarios for the loop body:
1. If `array[mid] <= find`, then `l` is updated to `mid`.
2. If `array[mid] > find`, then `r` is updated to `mid`.

In both cases, we need to ensure that the new values of `l` and `r` maintain the condition `r - l > 1`.

Since `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`, the new value of `l` or `r` will be `mid`, which is the integer division of `(l + r) // 2`.

To guarantee that `r - l > 1` after the update, we need to ensure that the initial difference `r - l` is at least 3. This is because after updating either `l` or `r` to `mid`, the difference will still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the end of the previous iteration should be adjusted to ensure that `r - l` is at least 3.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n); `r` must be at least `l + 3`; `mid` is the integer value `(l + r) // 2`. If `array[mid] <= find`, then `l` is updated to the value of `mid`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to the value of `mid`.**
