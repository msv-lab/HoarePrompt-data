Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n); `l` is 0; `r` is `n`; `mid` is `(0 + n) // 2`**

In simple terms, the variable `mid` is now calculated as the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2, which is `(0 + n) // 2`. The other variables (`array`, `find`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged.
