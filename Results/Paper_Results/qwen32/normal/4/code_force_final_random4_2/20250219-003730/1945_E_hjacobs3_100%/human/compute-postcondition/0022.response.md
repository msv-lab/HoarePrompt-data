Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index (1-based) of the largest element in `array` that is less than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the index (1-based) of `find` in `array`.**

In simpler terms, the output is a list with two values:
1. The position (1-based index) of the largest number in `array` that is not greater than `find`.
2. The position (1-based index) of `find` itself in `array`.
