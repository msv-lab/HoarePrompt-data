Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to rearrange the elements in a permutation such that after a binary search is performed, the element at the position `l` is equal to `x`. The binary search is described in the problem statement, and we can perform up to 2 swaps to achieve our goal.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and then the permutation `array`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It initializes `l` and `r` for binary search.
   - It performs the binary search but does not modify the array.
   - After the binary search, it checks if the element at position `l` is equal to `x`.
   - If they are not equal, it prints `1` and suggests a swap between `l` and the index of `x` in the array.
   - If they are equal, it prints `0`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search is performed on the original array without any modifications. However, the problem requires us to rearrange the array using up to 2 swaps so that the binary search ends with `p_l` equal to `x`.

2. **Swap Logic**: The program suggests a single swap if the binary search does not end with `p_l` equal to `x`. However, the problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, and the program does not utilize this fact.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints the number of swaps and the swap operations directly from within the `func_1` function. This is not the expected behavior since the output should be collected and printed for each test case after processing all test cases.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where multiple swaps are needed and does not ensure that the binary search will end with `p_l` equal to `x` after the swaps.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to rearrange the array using up to 2 swaps so that the binary search ends with `p_l` equal to `x`. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Correctness

Correctness: **False**
