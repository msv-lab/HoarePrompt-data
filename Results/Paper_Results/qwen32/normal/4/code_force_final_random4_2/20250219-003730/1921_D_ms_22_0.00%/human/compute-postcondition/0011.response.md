The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ans` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is an empty list; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0.**
