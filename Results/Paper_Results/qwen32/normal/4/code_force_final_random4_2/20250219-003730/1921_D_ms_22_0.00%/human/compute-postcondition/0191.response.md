The code snippet adds a tuple to the `max_heap` using the `heapq.heappush` function. The tuple added is `(-diff1, i, 0)`. This operation does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `i`, `diff1`, or `diff2`. It only modifies the `max_heap` by adding the new tuple.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the next element in the list `a` (i.e., the element after the current `i`), `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `max_heap` includes the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`**.
