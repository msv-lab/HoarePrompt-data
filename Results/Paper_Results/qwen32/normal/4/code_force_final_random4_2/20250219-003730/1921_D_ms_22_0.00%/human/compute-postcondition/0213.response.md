Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` contains `n-1` tuples of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)`; `ans` is the original `ans` plus `max_diff`; `item` is the tuple with the largest `max_diff` value from the original `max_heap`. If `item[2]` was equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is updated to 1 and `tp2` remains `m - 1`. Otherwise, `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is updated to `m - 2`. Additionally, `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, and if `item[2]` was equal to `tp1`, it is now equal to `tp1 - 1`.**
