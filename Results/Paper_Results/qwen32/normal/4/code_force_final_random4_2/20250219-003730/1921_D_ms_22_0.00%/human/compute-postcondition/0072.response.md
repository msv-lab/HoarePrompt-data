Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` contains at least one element but does not include the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`; `item` is the tuple with the smallest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`; `tp1` is incremented by 1; `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1`.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` is increased by `diff1`. All other variables retain their previous values.
