The code sorts the list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input.**
