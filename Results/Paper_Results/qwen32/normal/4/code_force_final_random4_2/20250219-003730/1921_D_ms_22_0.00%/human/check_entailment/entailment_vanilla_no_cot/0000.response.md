Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum total difference \( D \) as required by the problem description. The approach taken in the program is flawed and does not guarantee the optimal solution. Here is a brief explanation of why:

1. The program uses a max heap to store the differences between each element of array \( a \) and the smallest and largest elements of array \( b \). However, it does not correctly handle the selection of elements from \( b \) to maximize \( D \).

2. The program does not ensure that each element from \( b \) is used at most once, which is a requirement for forming the array \( c \).

3. The logic for updating the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` and re-evaluating the differences is incorrect and can lead to suboptimal results.

To solve the problem correctly, a more efficient and straightforward approach is to sort both arrays \( a \) and \( b \), and then use a greedy strategy to maximize the difference. One possible correct approach is:

- Sort both arrays \( a \) and \( b \).
- Use two pointers to select elements from \( b \) to maximize the difference \( D \). Specifically, pair the smallest element of \( a \) with the largest element of \( b \), the second smallest element of \( a \) with the second largest element of \( b \), and so on.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
            a = list(map(int, input().split()))
            b = list(map(int, input().split()))
            a.sort()
            b.sort()
            ans = 0
            i, j = 0, m - 1
            while i < n:
                ans += abs(a[i] - b[j])
                i += 1
                j -= 1
            print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version sorts both arrays and pairs elements to maximize the total difference \( D \).
