The only variable in the loop head is `max_heap`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `max_heap` is not empty. If `max_heap` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `max_heap` had an element popped from it, so to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `max_heap` must contain at least one more element.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` must contain at least one more tuple, `item` is the tuple with the largest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is `ans + diff2`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1` (which is 0), then `tp1` is updated to 1. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp2` (which is `m - 1`), then `tp2` is updated to `m - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is the largest absolute difference from the popped tuple.**
