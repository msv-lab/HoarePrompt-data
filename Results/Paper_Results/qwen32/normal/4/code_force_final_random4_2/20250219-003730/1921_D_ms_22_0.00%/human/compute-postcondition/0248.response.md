Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum possible sum of absolute differences between each element in `a` and a selected element in `b`. The function ensures that each element in `b` is used at most once across all elements in `a` to achieve this minimum sum.**
