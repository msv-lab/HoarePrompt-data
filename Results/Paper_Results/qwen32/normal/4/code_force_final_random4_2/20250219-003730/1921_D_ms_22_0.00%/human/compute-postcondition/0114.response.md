The only variable in the loop head is `max_heap`. The `while max_heap:` loop will execute if `max_heap` is not empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `max_heap` contains at least one element before the loop starts.

Given the description of `max_heap`, it is constructed from tuples `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` for each element in the list `a`. To ensure `max_heap` is not empty, we need to ensure that `a` has at least one element, and consequently, `max_heap` will be populated with at least one tuple.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `a` has at least one element.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` is a list containing tuples `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` for each element in `a`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0**
