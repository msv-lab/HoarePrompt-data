Reasoning:

The provided problem statement is about maximizing the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) between two arrays \( a \) and \( c \), where \( c \) is a permutation of \( n \) elements chosen from a larger array \( b \) of size \( m \).

The given program, however, does not maximize the difference \( D \). Instead, it minimizes the total difference between the arrays \( a \) and \( c \). This is evident from the execution summary, which states that the function calculates and prints the minimum possible sum of absolute differences between each element in \( a \) and a selected element in \( b \).

To maximize the difference \( D \), the program should select the largest possible differences for each element in \( a \). This can be achieved by pairing the smallest elements of \( a \) with the largest elements of \( b \) and the largest elements of \( a \) with the smallest elements of \( b \).

For example, for the first test case in the problem statement:
- \( a = [6, 1, 2, 4] \)
- \( b = [3, 5, 1, 7, 2, 3] \)

The program should select elements from \( b \) such that the differences are maximized. One optimal choice would be to pair \( 6 \) with \( 1 \), \( 1 \) with \( 7 \), \( 2 \) with \( 3 \), and \( 4 \) with \( 5 \). This results in:
- \( D = |6-1| + |1-7| + |2-3| + |4-5| = 5 + 6 + 1 + 1 = 13 \)

However, the program instead minimizes the differences, leading to an incorrect result.

Thus, the given program is incorrect for the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
