The given code snippet only modifies the value of `tp1` by incrementing it by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping the rest of the variables in their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, with one element removed; `item` is the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`; `tp1` is the original value of `tp1` plus 1; `tp2` is unchanged; `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `diff`.**
