Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` contains `n-1` tuples of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)`; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 2`; `ans` is the original `ans` plus `max_diff`; `item` is the tuple with the largest `max_diff` value from the original `max_heap`. Additionally, `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, and `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that `tp2` is decremented by 1, so it is now `m - 2` instead of `m - 1`. All other variables retain their original values or conditions.
