Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple with the largest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `diff1` is calculated as the absolute difference between the second element of the tuple `item` and the element at index `tp1` in the sorted list `b`. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
