Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` contains `n-1` tuples of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)`; `item` is the tuple with the largest `max_diff` value from the original `max_heap`. The current `item[2]` (index_in_b) is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`. If `diff1` (the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`) is greater than `diff2` (the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`), then `tp1` is set to 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is set to `m - 2` and `ans` is increased by `diff2`.**
