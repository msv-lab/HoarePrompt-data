Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` is not empty and contains at least one tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)`, but one element has been removed; `item` is the tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` that was at the root of `max_heap` before the pop operation; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`; `tp2` is decreased by 1; `ans` is increased by `diff2`.**

This means that the variable `ans` has been updated by adding the value of `diff2` to it. All other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
