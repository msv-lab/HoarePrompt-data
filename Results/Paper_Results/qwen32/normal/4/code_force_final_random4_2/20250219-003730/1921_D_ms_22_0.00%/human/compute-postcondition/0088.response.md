The code snippet `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` in ascending order. This affects the list `b` directly, but does not change the values of any other variables.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input; `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is an empty list; `tp1` is equal to `m` (all elements of `b` have been used from the lower end); `tp2` is -1 (all elements of `b` have been used from the upper end); `ans` is the sum of the minimum distances required to match each element of `a` with elements of `b`.**

In natural language: The list `b` is now sorted in ascending order, while all other variables retain their initial values.
