The code snippet `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes and returns the smallest element from the `max_heap` (which is actually a min-heap due to the negative sign in the tuple elements). This operation modifies `max_heap` by removing the `item` that was at the root of the heap.

Given the Initial State, `item` was previously a tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`. After this operation, `item` is reassigned to the new smallest element in `max_heap`, and `max_heap` is now missing this element.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` is not empty and contains at least one tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)`, but one element has been removed; `item` is now the tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` that was at the root of `max_heap` before the pop operation.**
