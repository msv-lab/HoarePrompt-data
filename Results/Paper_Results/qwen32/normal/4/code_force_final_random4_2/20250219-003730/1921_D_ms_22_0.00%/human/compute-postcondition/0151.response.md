The code assigns `diff2` the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple with the smallest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`**

In natural language: The value of `diff2` is now the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
