The `while` loop in the provided code snippet continues as long as `max_heap` is not empty. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `max_heap` contains at least one tuple.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element
- `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input
- `max_heap` contains at least one tuple
- `item` is the tuple with the largest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`
- Additional conditions and state changes based on the value of `item[2]` relative to `tp1` and `tp2`.

Since `max_heap` already contains at least one tuple, no further adjustment is needed to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. The state of `max_heap` should remain such that it contains at least one tuple.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple with the largest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`**
