Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple with the largest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes the tuple with the largest absolute difference from `max_heap` and assigns it to `item`. The other variables remain unchanged as the code does not modify them.
