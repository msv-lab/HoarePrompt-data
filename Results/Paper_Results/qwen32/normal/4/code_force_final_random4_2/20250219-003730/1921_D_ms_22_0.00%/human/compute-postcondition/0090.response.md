Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input; `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is an empty list; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is -1 (all elements of `b` have been used from the upper end); `ans` is the sum of the minimum distances required to match each element of `a` with elements of `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `tp1` has been changed to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values and states.
