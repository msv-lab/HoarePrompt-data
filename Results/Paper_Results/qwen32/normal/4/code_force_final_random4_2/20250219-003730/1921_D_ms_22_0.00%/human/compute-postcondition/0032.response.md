Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, where `diff` is the larger of `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `index` is `0` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, otherwise `m - 1`; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0. `diff1` and `diff2` are not explicitly tracked but are used to determine the contents of `max_heap`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `max_heap` will contain a tuple for each element in `a`. Each tuple will have the negative of the larger difference between the element and the first or last element of `b`, the element itself, and an index indicating whether the larger difference was with the first (`0`) or last (`m - 1`) element of `b`. The other variables like `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
