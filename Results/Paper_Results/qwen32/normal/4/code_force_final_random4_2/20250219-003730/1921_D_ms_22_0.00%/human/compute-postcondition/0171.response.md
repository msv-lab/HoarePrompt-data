The provided code snippet initializes a new variable `tp1` and assigns it the value `0`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` is an empty list; `tp1` is 0**.
