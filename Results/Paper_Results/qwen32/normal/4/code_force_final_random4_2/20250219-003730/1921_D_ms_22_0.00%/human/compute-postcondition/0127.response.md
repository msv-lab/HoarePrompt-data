The code snippet `ans += -item[0]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the negative of the first element of the tuple `item`. Since `item` is the tuple with the largest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`, and `max_heap` contains tuples of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, the value of `item[0]` is negative of the largest absolute difference. Therefore, `-item[0]` is the largest absolute difference.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` is a list containing tuples `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` for each element in `a` except the one popped, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is the largest absolute difference from the popped tuple, `item` is the tuple with the largest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`. Additionally, `item[2]` is either equal to `tp1` or equal to `tp2`.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` has been updated to the largest absolute difference from the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`. All other variables remain unchanged.
