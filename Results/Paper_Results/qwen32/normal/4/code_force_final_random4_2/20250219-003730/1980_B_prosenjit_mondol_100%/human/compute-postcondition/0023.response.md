Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `f` is the second input integer decremented by 1.
- `k` is the third input integer decremented by 1.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input sorted in descending order.
- `x` is `a[f]`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement in the provided code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```
This statement directly prints the string `'NO'` without any reference to the variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, or `x`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
