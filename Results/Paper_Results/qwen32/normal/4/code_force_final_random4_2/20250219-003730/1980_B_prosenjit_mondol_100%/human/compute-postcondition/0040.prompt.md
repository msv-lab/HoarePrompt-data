Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for each i from 1 to n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    f -= 1
    k -= 1
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = a[f]
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    if a[k] > x:
        print('NO')
    elif a[k] < x:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is unchanged, `f` and `k` are each decremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `x` is `a[f]`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then `a[k]` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`, specifically `a[k]` is strictly less than `x` if it is not equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the second input integer decremented by 1, `k` is the third input integer decremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input sorted in descending order, `x` is `a[f]`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, the condition holds as specified in the if part. Otherwise, `a[k]` is not greater than `x`. In both cases, the values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the second input integer minus 1, `k` is the third input integer minus 1, `a` is a new list of integers from the input sorted in descending order, and `x` is the element at the original index `f` from the unsorted list `a`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, no specific action is described in the if part. If `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`, no specific action is described in the else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
