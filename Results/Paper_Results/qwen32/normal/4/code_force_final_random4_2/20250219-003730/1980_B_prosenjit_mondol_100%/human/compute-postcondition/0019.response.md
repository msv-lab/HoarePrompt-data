Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the second input integer decremented by 1, `k` is the third input integer decremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `x` is `a[f+1]`.**

In this output state, the only variable that has been changed is `k`, which has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
