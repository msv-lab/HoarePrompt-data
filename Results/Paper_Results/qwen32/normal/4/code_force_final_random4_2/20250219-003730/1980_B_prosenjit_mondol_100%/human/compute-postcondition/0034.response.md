The list `a` is sorted in descending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged. The variable `x` was initially set to `a[f]`, and its value will still be the same element from the original list `a` but now located at a new index due to the sorting.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the second input integer minus 1, `k` is the third input integer minus 1, `a` is a new list of integers from the input sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at the original index `f` from the unsorted list `a`.**
