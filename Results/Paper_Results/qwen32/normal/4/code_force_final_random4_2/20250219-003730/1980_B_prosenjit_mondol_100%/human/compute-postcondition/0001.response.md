The code snippet provided reads a single line of input, which is expected to contain three integers separated by spaces. These integers are then unpacked into the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`. The variable `a` is not affected by this code snippet.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and it is provided as the number of test cases or iterations, the code snippet itself does not depend on `t` for its execution. It simply reads the next line of input and assigns the values to `n`, `f`, and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, and `k` are the integers read from the input, `a` is unchanged.**
