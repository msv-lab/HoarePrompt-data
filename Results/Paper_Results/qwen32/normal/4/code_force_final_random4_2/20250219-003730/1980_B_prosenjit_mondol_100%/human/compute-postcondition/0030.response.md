The value of `f` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the second input integer minus 1, `k` is the third input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input sorted in descending order, `x` is `a[f + 1]`.**
