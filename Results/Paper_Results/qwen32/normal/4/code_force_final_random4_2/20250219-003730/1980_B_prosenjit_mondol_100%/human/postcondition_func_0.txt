The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `f`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines and prints whether the `k`-th largest element in the sorted list is greater than, less than, or potentially equal to the element at index `f` (1-based index), outputting 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' respectively.
