Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings containing the split input values where the first element can be converted to an integer greater than 0; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `index` is 3; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`; `q` is the integer value of the third element in `data`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` is `[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings containing the split input values where the first element can be converted to an integer greater than 0; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `index` is 4; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data` and must be greater than or equal to 1; `q` is the integer value of the third element in `data`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[3]` which is `int(data[3])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[4]` which is 0; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` is `[0, 4]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings containing the split input values where the first element can be converted to an integer greater than 0; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `index` is 5; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data` and must be at least 5; `q` is the integer value of the third element in `data`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[3]` which is `int(data[3])` and `a[5]` which is `int(data[4])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[4]` which is 0 and `pf[5]` which is `a[5]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` is `[0, 4]` and `mp[int(data[4])]` is `[5]`; `i` is 5.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings containing the split input values where the first element can be converted to an integer greater than 0; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `index` is 6; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data` and must be at least 5; `q` is the integer value of the third element in `data`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[3]` which is `int(data[3])`, `a[5]` which is `int(data[4])`, and `a[6]` which is `int(data[5])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[4]` which is `0`, `pf[5]` which is `a[5]`, and `pf[6]` which is `int(data[4]) ^ int(data[5])`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` is `[0, 4]`, `mp[int(data[4])]` is `[5]`, and `mp[pf[6]]` is `[5, 6]`; `i` is 6.`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
