The keyword `continue` in Python is used within loops to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Given the context, the provided code snippet does not alter any variables or states; it simply instructs the loop to proceed to its next iteration.

Thus, none of the variables `data`, `n`, `q`, `index`, `t`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `results`, `l`, `r`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, or `x` are modified. The value of `q` is still `q - 1` as it was before the `continue` statement, and all other variables retain their respective values from the initial state.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing at least `2n + 5` elements, `data[index - 2]` is a string representing an integer value greater than or equal to 1, `n` is `int(data[index - 2])`, `q` is `q - 1`, `index` is `2n + 5 + 2*q + 2 + n + 4 + 2`, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` is `int(data[index - (n + 1) + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list, `mp[0]` contains the value `[0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` contains all indices `i` for which `pf[i]` is the same, `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries plus `'YES'`, `l` is `int(data[index - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.**
