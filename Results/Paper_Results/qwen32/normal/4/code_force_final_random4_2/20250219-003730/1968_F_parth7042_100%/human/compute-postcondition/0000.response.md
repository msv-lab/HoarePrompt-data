The code snippet `data = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. This input is expected to contain the values for `t`, `n`, `q`, and the elements of the array `a`, as well as the query pairs `l` and `r`.

Given the initial state, the variable `data` will now hold the split input values as a list of strings. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, and the queries) remain unchanged until they are explicitly assigned values from `data`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; the array `a` contains `n` integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for each i; each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= l < r <= n; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
