Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1; `index` is `n + 5`; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[0]` contains `[0]`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries.**

In this output state, the only change is that the defaultdict `mp` now has an entry for the key `0` with the value `[0]`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
