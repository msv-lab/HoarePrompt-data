You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array `a` and a set of queries. For each query defined by indices `l` and `r`, it determines if there exists a subarray `a[l-1:r]` whose XOR is zero and appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results based on this condition. After processing all queries for all test cases, it prints the results, one per line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine if a subarray can be split into more than one segment such that the bitwise XOR of all elements in each segment is equal. The program needs to handle multiple test cases, each with an array and multiple queries.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads input, processes each test case, and answers each query by checking if the subarray can be split into segments with equal XOR values.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the array and the number of queries.
   - For each query, it reads the subarray bounds.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - It calculates the prefix XOR for the array. `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray using the prefix XOR values.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is `0`, it directly returns "YES" because the subarray can be trivially split into segments with XOR `0`.
   - Otherwise, it uses a map (`mp`) to store indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
   - It then checks if there are indices in the map that can form valid segments with the required properties.

### Potential Issues:
- The code seems to correctly handle the case when the XOR of the subarray is `0`.
- The code uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find valid indices in the map, which should be efficient.
- The code uses a map to store indices of prefix XOR values, which is a good approach to efficiently check for possible segmentations.

### Edge Cases:
- **Subarray with XOR `0`:** The code correctly handles this by returning "YES".
- **Single Element Subarrays:** The problem description specifies that `l < r`, so single-element subarrays are not considered.
- **All Elements Same:** If all elements in the subarray are the same, the XOR of the subarray will be `0` if the length is even, and the element value if the length is odd. The code should handle these cases correctly.
- **Random XOR Values:** The code uses the map to find valid segmentations, which should work for any random XOR values.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code and its handling of various cases, it seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The code efficiently handles the constraints and edge cases mentioned.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the prefix XOR for the array and uses a map to efficiently check for valid segmentations for each query. It handles all edge cases, including subarrays with XOR `0`, and uses binary search to find valid indices, ensuring efficient query processing.
