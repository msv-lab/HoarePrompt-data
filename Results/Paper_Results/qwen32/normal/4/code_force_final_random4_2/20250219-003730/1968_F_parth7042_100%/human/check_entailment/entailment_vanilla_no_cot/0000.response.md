Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in how it determines if a subarray is "interesting." Specifically, the condition to check if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values is not correctly implemented.

The key issue is in the following code snippet:
```python
if x == 0:
    results.append('YES')
    continue
v1 = mp[pf[r]]
v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2]):
    results.append('YES')
else:
    results.append('NO')
```
Here, the program checks if there exists an index `it1` in `v1` (which is the list of indices where the prefix XOR equals `pf[r]`) and an index `it2` in `v2` (which is the list of indices where the prefix XOR equals `pf[l - 1]`) such that `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`. However, this does not guarantee that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

To correctly determine if a subarray is interesting, the program should check if the XOR value of the subarray (i.e., `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`) can be achieved by splitting the subarray into parts with equal XOR values. This requires checking if there exists a divisor `d` of the length of the subarray such that the XOR of every `d`-th element in the subarray is the same.

The current implementation does not perform this check and thus may incorrectly identify some subarrays as interesting.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
