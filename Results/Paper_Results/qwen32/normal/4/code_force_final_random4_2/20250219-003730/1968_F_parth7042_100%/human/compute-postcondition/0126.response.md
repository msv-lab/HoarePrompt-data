Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing at least `2n + 5` elements; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1; `index` is `2n + 9`; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the first `n` elements which are `int(data[n + 5])` to `int(data[2n + 4])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the first `n` elements which are the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` contains `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries with an additional 'YES'; `l` is `int(data[2n + 7])`; `r` is `int(data[2n + 8])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `[r]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is either `0` or `1` depending on whether `l` is less than or equal to `r` or greater than `r`; `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**

The `continue` statement does not change any of the variables or their values. The program simply proceeds to the next iteration of the loop (if within a loop) or the next line of code. Therefore, all variables retain their previous values.
