Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: data is a list of strings containing the split input values where the first element can be converted to an integer greater than 0; t is the integer value of the first element in data and must be greater than 0; index is n + 3; results is an empty list; n is the integer value of the second element in data; q is the integer value of the third element in data; a is a list of n + 1 zeros except a[i] which is int(data[i + 2]) for i from 1 to n; pf is a list of n + 1 zeros except pf[i] which is the cumulative XOR of a[1] to a[i] for i from 1 to n; mp is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and mp[pf[i]] is a list of indices j such that pf[j] equals pf[i] for i from 1 to n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings containing the split input values where the first element can be converted to an integer greater than 0; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `index` is `n + 5`; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`; `q` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 2])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list of indices `j` such that `pf[j]` equals `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `l` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `r` is `int(data[n + 4])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the position where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is the position where `r` would be inserted into `v2` to maintain sorted order, minus 1. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, then `results` contains two 'YES' strings. Otherwise, `results` contains the string 'YES' if `x` equals 0, otherwise `results` contains the string 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings containing the split input values; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `index` is `n + 7`; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`; `q` is one less than its current value and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 2])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list of indices `j` such that `pf[j]` equals `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `l` is `int(data[n + 5])`; `r` is `int(data[n + 6])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the position where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is the position where `r` would be inserted into `v2` to maintain sorted order, minus 1; `results` contains two 'YES' strings if `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, otherwise `results` contains the string 'YES' if `x` equals 0, otherwise `results` contains the string 'NO'. If `x` equals 0, `results` now contains an additional 'YES' string. If `it1` is not less than the length of `v1` or `it2` is less than 0, or `v1[it1]` is not less than `v2[it2]`, `results` now contains an additional 'NO' string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings containing the split input values; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `index` is `n + 9`; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`; `q` is one less than its current value and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 2])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list of indices `j` such that `pf[j]` equals `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `l` is `int(data[n + 7])`; `r` is `int(data[index + 1])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the position where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is the position where `r` would be inserted into `v2` to maintain sorted order, minus 1; `results` contains the original contents plus an additional 'YES' string if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`; otherwise, `results` contains the original contents plus an additional 'NO' string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
