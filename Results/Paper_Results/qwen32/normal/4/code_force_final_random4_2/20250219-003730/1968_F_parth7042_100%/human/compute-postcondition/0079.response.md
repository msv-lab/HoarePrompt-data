The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` changes the value of `n` to the integer value of the element in `data` at the position specified by `index`. 

Given the initial state:
- `data` is a list of strings containing the split input values.
- `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1.
- `index` is `n + 3 + 2*q`.
- `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`.
- `q` is 0.
- `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 2])` for `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list of indices `j` such that `pf[j]` equals `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries.

Since `q` is 0, `index` simplifies to `n + 3`. The code snippet reassigns `n` to the integer value of `data[n + 3]`. Therefore, the new value of `n` will be `int(data[n + 3])`.

The other variables (`t`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1; `index` is `n + 3 + 2*q`; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 2])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list of indices `j` such that `pf[j]` equals `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries.**
