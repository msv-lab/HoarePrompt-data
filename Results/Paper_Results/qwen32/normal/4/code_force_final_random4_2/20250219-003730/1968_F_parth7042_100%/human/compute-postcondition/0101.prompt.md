Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings containing the split input values; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1; `index` is `n + 5`; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[0]` contains `[0]`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings containing at least 4 elements where `data[3]` is a string that can be converted to an integer greater than or equal to 1, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1, `index` is `n + 6`, `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`, `q` is `int(data[n + 4])`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[n + 5])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` contains `[i]` (or `mp[0]` contains `[0, i]` if `pf[i]` is `0`), `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings containing at least 4 elements where `data[3]` is a string that can be converted to an integer greater than or equal to 1; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1; `index` is `n + 7`; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[n + 6])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` and `pf[n + 1]` is `pf[n] ^ a[n + 1]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` contains `[i]` (or `mp[0]` contains `[0, i]` if `pf[i]` is `0`); `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries; `i` is `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings containing at least 4 elements where `data[3]` is a string that can be converted to an integer greater than or equal to 1; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1; `index` is `n + 8`; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[n + 7])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` and `pf[n + 1]` is `pf[n] ^ a[n + 1]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` contains `[i]` (or `mp[0]` contains `[0, i]` if `pf[i]` is `0`), and `mp[pf[n + 1]]` contains `[n + 1]`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries; `i` is `n + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
