To determine what will be printed by the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement, we need to understand the context provided by the initial state:

1. `data` is a list of strings containing the split input values.
2. `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`.
3. `index` is the position in `data` just after the last processed query.
4. `results` is a list containing the results of all queries from all iterations.

The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will concatenate all the elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).

Since the exact contents of the `results` list are not provided, we canâ€™t give a specific output. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output as follows:

The `results` list contains the results of all queries processed from the `data` list. Each result is a string, and these strings are joined together with newline characters to form the final output.

Output: **results (where results is a list of strings containing the results of all queries, joined by newline characters)**
