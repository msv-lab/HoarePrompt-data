Output State: **t is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; i is t - 1; n is the first integer from the last input; k is the second integer from the last input. If k is greater than or equal to n - 1, then 1 is printed. Otherwise, n - 1 is printed.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations (which is `t` times), the loop counter `i` will be `t - 1`. The variables `n` and `k` will hold the values from the last input pair. Depending on the condition `k >= n - 1`, either `1` or `n - 1` will have been printed for the final test case.
