The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the previous values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the new input values. The variable `t` (number of test cases) and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `i` is 1; `n` is the first integer from the new input; `k` is the second integer from the new input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.**
