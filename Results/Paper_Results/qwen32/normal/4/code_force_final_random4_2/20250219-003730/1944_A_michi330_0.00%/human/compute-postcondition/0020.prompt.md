You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains two integers n and k where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2. The input consists of multiple test cases, the number of which is given by the first integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
        
    #State: t is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; i is t - 1; n is the first integer from the last input; k is the second integer from the last input. If k is greater than or equal to n - 1, then 1 is printed. Otherwise, n - 1 is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. The integer `n` represents the number of elements in a set, and `k` represents a specific number of pairs that can be formed from the set. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `k` is within the valid range of 0 to `n * (n - 1) / 2`, the function returns a specific result (which is not detailed here). If `k` is outside this range, the function returns an error message indicating that `k` is invalid for the given `n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
