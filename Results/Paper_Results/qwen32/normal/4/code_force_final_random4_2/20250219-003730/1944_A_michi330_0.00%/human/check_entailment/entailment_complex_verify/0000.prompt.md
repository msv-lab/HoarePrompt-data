You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains two integers n and k where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2. The input consists of multiple test cases, the number of which is given by the first integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
        
    #State: t is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; i is t - 1; n is the first integer from the last input; k is the second integer from the last input. If k is greater than or equal to n - 1, then 1 is printed. Otherwise, n - 1 is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`; otherwise, it prints `n - 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- We have `n` islands, and initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge.
- Dominater can destroy at most `k` bridges.
- We need to find the minimum number of islands (including island 1) that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

### Analysis of the Program
The provided program seems to make a critical assumption about the relationship between `k` and `n` to determine the number of islands Everule can visit:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
```

### Key Points to Consider
1. **Case 1: `k >= n - 1`**
   - If Dominater can destroy at least `n-1` bridges, Everule will be isolated on island 1 because at least one bridge to every other island can be destroyed.
   - The program correctly outputs `1` in this case.

2. **Case 2: `k < n - 1`**
   - If Dominater can destroy fewer than `n-1` bridges, Everule will still be able to visit `n-1` islands because it is impossible to disconnect island 1 from at least `n-1-k` other islands.
   - The program correctly outputs `n-1` in this case.

### Edge Cases to Consider
- **Single Island (`n = 1`):**
  - If `n = 1`, there are no bridges to begin with, and the program should output `1` regardless of `k`.
  - The program handles this correctly since `k >= n-1` is always true for `n = 1`.

- **No Bridges Destroyed (`k = 0`):**
  - If `k = 0`, Everule can visit all `n` islands.
  - The program outputs `n-1` which is incorrect for this case.

### Conclusion
The program fails in the case where `k = 0` and `n > 1`. In this scenario, Everule should be able to visit all `n` islands, but the program incorrectly outputs `n-1`.

### Example of Failure
For input:
```
1
3 0
```
Expected output is `3` (Everule can visit all 3 islands), but the program outputs `2`.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**.
