Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `i` is 1; `n` is the first integer from the new input; `k` is the second integer from the new input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.**

Since the if and else parts of the block provide the same conditions and descriptions for `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`, the overall postcondition remains consistent with the given conditions.
