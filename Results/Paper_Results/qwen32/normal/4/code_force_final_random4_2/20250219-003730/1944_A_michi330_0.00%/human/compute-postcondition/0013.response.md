The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the constant `t`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `i` is 2; `n` is the first integer from the new input; `k` is the second integer from the new input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.**
