Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. The integer `n` represents the number of elements in a set, and `k` represents a specific number of pairs that can be formed from the set. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `k` is within the valid range of 0 to `n * (n - 1) / 2`, the function returns a specific result (which is not detailed here). If `k` is outside this range, the function returns an error message indicating that `k` is invalid for the given `n`.**
