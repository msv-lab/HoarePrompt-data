The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a new line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. This means the initial values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the new input values.

The condition `If k is greater than or equal to n - 1, then k is greater than or equal to n - 1. Otherwise, k is less than n - 1.` will be re-evaluated with the new values of `n` and `k`.

Since `t` represents the number of test cases and `i` is set to 2, these values remain unchanged. The new values of `n` and `k` will be used for the rest of the program.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `i` is 2; `n` is the first integer from the new input; `k` is the second integer from the new input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.**
