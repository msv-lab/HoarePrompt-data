The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases, and `i` remains 0 as it is not modified in the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^3, `i` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer.**
