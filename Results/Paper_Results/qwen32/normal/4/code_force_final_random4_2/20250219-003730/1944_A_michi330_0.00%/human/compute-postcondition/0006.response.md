Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet provided.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `k` is the second input integer.
- `k` is less than `n - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - 1)
```

### Explanation:
The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the value of `n - 1`.

- `n` is explicitly mentioned as the first input integer.
- The print statement directly computes and prints `n - 1`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't determine a specific numerical output. However, based on the given information, the output will be the value of `n - 1`.

### Output:
Output: **n - 1 (where n is the first input integer)**
