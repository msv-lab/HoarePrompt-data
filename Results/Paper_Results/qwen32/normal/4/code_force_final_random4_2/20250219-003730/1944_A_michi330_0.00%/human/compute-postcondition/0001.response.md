The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Given that `t` is already described as an input integer representing the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3`, it is already in a state that allows the loop to execute. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` since it is already within the valid range that allows the loop to execute. The variable `i` will be correctly initialized by the `range` function.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `i` is 0**
