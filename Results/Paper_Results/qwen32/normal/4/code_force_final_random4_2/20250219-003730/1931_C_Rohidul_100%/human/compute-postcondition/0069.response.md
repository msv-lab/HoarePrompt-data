To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head: `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Condition `l < r`**:
   - Given that `l` is initialized to `0` and `r` is initialized to `n - 1`, for `l < r` to be true, `n` must be at least `2`. This ensures that there are at least two elements in the list `a` to compare.

2. **Condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]`**:
   - This condition requires that the first two elements of the list `a` must be equal. Given that `l` is `0`, this translates to `a[0] == a[1]`.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the state such that:
- `n` is at least `2`.
- The first two elements of the list `a` are equal.

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not directly affect the loop's execution condition.

### Final State
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is at least `2`; `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1]`; `le` is the length of the new list `a`; `l` is `0`; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is `1`; `end` is `1`; If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `le - max(st, end)`**
