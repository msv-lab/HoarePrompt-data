To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop condition: `l`, `r`, and `a[l]`, `a[l + 1]`.

The loop condition is `while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`. For the loop to execute again, both conditions `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must be true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is at least `3`
- `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]`
- `le` is the length of the list `a`
- `l` is `2`
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `st` is `3`
- `end` is `1`
- If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `le - max(st, end)`

To ensure the loop executes one more time:
1. `l < r`: At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 2 and `r` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than `r`. Since `n` is at least 3, `r` is at least 2. To ensure `l < r`, `r` must be at least 3 (so `n` must be at least 4).
2. `a[l] == a[l + 1]`: At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 2. For the loop to execute, `a[2]` must be equal to `a[3]`.

Given that `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]`, we need to ensure that `a[3]` is equal to `a[2]`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `r` and `a[3]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is at least 4; `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1] == a[2] == a[3]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 2; `r` is at least 3; `st` is 3; `end` is 1; If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `le - max(st, end)`**
