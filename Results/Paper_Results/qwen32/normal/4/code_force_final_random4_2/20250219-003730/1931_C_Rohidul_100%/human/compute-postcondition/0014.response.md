The code snippet `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Given that the initial value of `l` is 2, after executing the code, `l` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 3; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where `a[0] == a[1]`, `a[1] == a[2]`, and `a[2] == a[3]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 3; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 3; `end` is 1**.
