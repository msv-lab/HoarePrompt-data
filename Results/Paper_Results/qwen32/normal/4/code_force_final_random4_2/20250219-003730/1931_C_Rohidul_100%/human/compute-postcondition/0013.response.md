To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `l`, `r`, and `a[l]` and `a[l + 1]`.

The loop condition is:
```
while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
```

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` must be at least 3
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]`
- `le` is the length of the list `a`
- `l` is 2
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `st` is 3
- `end` is 1

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `l < r`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 2 and `r` is `n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than `r`. Since `n` is at least 3, `r` is at least 2. Therefore, `l < r` can be true if `n > 3`. If `n == 3`, then `r` is 2, and `l < r` is false, so the loop cannot execute.

2. **Condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 2, so we need `a[2] == a[3]` for the loop to execute.
   - Given that `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]`, we need to ensure `a[2] == a[3]` to satisfy `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 3 so that `r` is greater than 2, and we need to ensure `a[2] == a[3]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 3; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where `a[0] == a[1]`, `a[1] == a[2]`, and `a[2] == a[3]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 2; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 3; `end` is 1**
