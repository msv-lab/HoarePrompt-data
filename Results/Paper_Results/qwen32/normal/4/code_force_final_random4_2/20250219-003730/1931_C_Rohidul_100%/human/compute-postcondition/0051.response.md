To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop condition: `r` and `a[r]`.

The loop condition is:
```
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the provided state:
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `l` is `n - 1`
- `a[r]` equals `a[r - 1]`

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `r > l`
2. `a[r] == a[r - 1]`

Currently, `r` is equal to `l` (`r` is `n - 1` and `l` is `n - 1`), so the condition `r > l` is not satisfied. To satisfy this condition, we need to adjust `r` so that it is greater than `l`. Since `l` is `n - 1`, we can set `r` to `n`.

Additionally, the condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must be satisfied. Given that `a[r]` equals `a[r - 1]` at the end of the previous iteration, this condition is already satisfied if `r` is adjusted correctly.

Therefore, we need to adjust `r` to be `n` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that `n <= le`; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is `n - 1`; `r` is `n`; `st` is `n`; `end` is `2`; `a[n]` equals `a[n - 1]`; if `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`; otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**
