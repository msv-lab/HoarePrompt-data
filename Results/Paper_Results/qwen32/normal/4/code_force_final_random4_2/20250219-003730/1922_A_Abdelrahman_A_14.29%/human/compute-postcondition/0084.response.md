Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is 2, `slength` is an input integer, `x` is the third character in `c`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, then `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.**
