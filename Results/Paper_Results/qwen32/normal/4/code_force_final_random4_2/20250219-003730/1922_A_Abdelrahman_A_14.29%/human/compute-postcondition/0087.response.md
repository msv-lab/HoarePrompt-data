Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` and `b` are input strings, `c` is the input string, `slength` is an input integer, `no` is True (since `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`), and `i` is set to `len(c) + 1`.**
