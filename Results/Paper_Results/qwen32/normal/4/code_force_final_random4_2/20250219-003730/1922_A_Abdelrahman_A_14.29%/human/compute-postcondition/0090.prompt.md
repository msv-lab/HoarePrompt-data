Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `tests` is an input integer; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(tests):
    slength = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    no = True
    if c == a or c == b:
        no = False
        print('NO')
    else:
        for x in c:
            if x not in a and x not in b:
                print('YES')
                no = False
                break
    if no:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is an input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string, `c` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, and `no` is True if `c` is neither equal to `a` nor `b`. Otherwise, `no` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, and `no` is True if `c` is not equal to `a` or `b` but all characters in `c` are in `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `no` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` and `b` are input strings, `c` is the input string, `slength` is an input integer, `no` is True if `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, and `i` is set to `len(c) + 1`. If `c` is equal to `a` or `c` is equal to `b`, `no` is False and `i` remains `len(c) + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
