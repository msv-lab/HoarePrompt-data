Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` and `b` are input strings, `c` is an input string with at least three characters, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, and `x` is the third character in `c`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, then `no` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `no` remains True.**
