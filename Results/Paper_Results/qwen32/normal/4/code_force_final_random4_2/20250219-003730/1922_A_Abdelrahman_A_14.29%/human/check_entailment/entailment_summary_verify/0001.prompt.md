You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it checks if a third string `c` is either equal to the first string `a` or the second string `b`, or if all characters in `c` are present in either `a` or `b`. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if `c` meets one of these conditions, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The task is to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not match it. Here's a breakdown of the conditions that need to be satisfied:

1. For a template `t`, if the `i-th` letter of `t` is lowercase, the `i-th` letter of both `a` and `b` must be the same as the `i-th` letter of `t`.
2. If the `i-th` letter of `t` is uppercase, the `i-th` letter of both `a` and `b` must be different from the lowercase version of the `i-th` letter of `t`.
3. String `c` must not satisfy the above conditions for any template `t`.

Now, let's look at the provided program:

```python
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Checking if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`:** The program first checks if `c` is exactly equal to `a` or `b`. If it is, it immediately prints "NO" because if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it's impossible to find a template that `a` and `b` match but `c` does not match.
2. **Checking for a character in `c` that is not in `a` or `b`:** If `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`, the program then checks if there is any character in `c` that is not present in both `a` and `b`. If such a character exists, it prints "YES" because we can create a template with an uppercase letter at that position, which would match `a` and `b` but not `c`.
3. **Final "NO":** If the loop completes without finding a character in `c` that is not in `a` or `b`, the program prints "NO".

### Issues:
The provided program does not fully capture all possible templates. Specifically, it only checks for a single character in `c` that is not in `a` or `b`, but it does not consider the possibility of creating a template where multiple characters are handled differently (some uppercase, some lowercase).

For example, consider the case:
```
3
acc
abd
abc
```
The program will print "NO" because all characters in `c` are present in both `a` and `b`. However, a valid template could be "AbC", which matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it doesn't consider all possible valid templates.

Correctness: **False**
