To determine the Output State, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

Initial State:
- `t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1
- `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it
- `n` is greater than 1
- `ax` is 1000000007
- `a` is the first integer from the input
- `x` is the second integer from the input
- If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is not 1, `bx` is -1.
- If `a` is 2, `ax` is set to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing `x`.

Given Code:
```python
bx = max(x, bx)
```

Impact of the Code:
- The code updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the current value of `bx`.

Output State:
- `t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1 (unchanged)
- `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it (unchanged)
- `n` is greater than 1 (unchanged)
- `ax` is 1000000007 (unchanged)
- `a` is the first integer from the input (unchanged)
- `x` is the second integer from the input (unchanged)
- `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx` (updated)
- If `a` is 2, `ax` is set to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 (unchanged)
- Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing `x` (unchanged)

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1, `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it, `n` is greater than 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`, if `a` is 2, `ax` is set to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, otherwise, `cx` is a set containing `x`**.
