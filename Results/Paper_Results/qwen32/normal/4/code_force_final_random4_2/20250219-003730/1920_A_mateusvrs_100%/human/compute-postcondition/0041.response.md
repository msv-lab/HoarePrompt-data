The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the iterable `cx`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `cx` and the variable `i`. Since `i` is the first element of `cx` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `cx` must have at least one more element, and `i` should be updated to the next element in `cx`.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:
- `i` should be updated to the next element in `cx`.
- `cx` must have at least one more element for the loop to continue.

Given that `i` was the first element of `cx` at the end of the previous iteration, now `i` should be the second element of `cx` for the next iteration to start.

State: **`t`, `bx`, and `ax` are as described in the precondition; `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`; `tmp` is 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` remains 0; `cx` must be an iterable with at least two elements; `i` is the second element of `cx`.**
