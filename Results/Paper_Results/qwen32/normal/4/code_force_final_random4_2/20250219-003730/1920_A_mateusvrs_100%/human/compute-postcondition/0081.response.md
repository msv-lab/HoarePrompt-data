Postcondition: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, `n` is the input integer, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values added when `a` was not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 2, and `bx` is the maximum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 1. Additionally, `bx` is greater than `ax`.**
