Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 2, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` where `a` is 1, and `cx` is a set containing all `x` where `a` is neither 1 nor 2. Additionally, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 2, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least one element (e.g., `cx` contains `x` where `a` is neither 1 nor 2 and there is at least one such `x`), `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. If `bx <= i <= ax`, then `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 2, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least one more element that `i` has not iterated over, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `i` is an element in `cx` that has not been iterated over yet. If `i` is between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, `tmp` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 2, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least one more element that `i` has not iterated over, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `i` is the next element in `cx` that has not been iterated over yet. If `i` is between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, `tmp` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
