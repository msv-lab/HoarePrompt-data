The code snippet `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` was initially an empty set, after this operation, `cx` will contain the single element `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer and `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, `x` is an input integer.**
