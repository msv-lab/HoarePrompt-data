The code snippet `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. The values of `t`, `bx`, `ax`, `cx`, and `i` remain unchanged as per the precondition.

Output State: **`t`, `bx`, and `ax` are as described in the precondition; `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`; `tmp` is 1; `cx` must be an iterable with at least one element; `i` is the first element of `cx` and `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**
