The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `cx` as an empty set. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `r`, `bx`, `ax`, `tmp`, or `n`. Therefore, the only change in the output state is the introduction of `cx` as an empty set.

Output State: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1; `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, the additional element is `0`. Otherwise, the additional element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`; `n` is an input integer; `cx` is an empty set.**
