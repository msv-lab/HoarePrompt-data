Precondition: **Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints. Following this, there are n lines, each containing two integers a (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). If a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x. If a=2, k must be less than or equal to x. If a=3, k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same. The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases.**
