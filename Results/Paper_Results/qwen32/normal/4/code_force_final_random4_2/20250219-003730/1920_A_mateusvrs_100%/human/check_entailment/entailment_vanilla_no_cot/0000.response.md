Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem based on the given problem description.

### Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - Then, it reads each constraint and processes it.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - The program uses three variables to keep track of the constraints:
     - `cx`: A set to store all the values that `k` cannot be (`a == 3`).
     - `ax`: The maximum upper bound (`a == 2`).
     - `bx`: The minimum lower bound (`a == 1`).
   - For each constraint:
     - If `a == 1`, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`.
     - If `a == 2`, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`.
     - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Calculating the Result:**
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx > ax`. If true, it means there is no valid `k` that can satisfy all constraints, so it appends `0` to the result list.
   - If `bx <= ax`, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of invalid `k` values (those in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`) from the total possible `k` values in the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - The formula used is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of invalid `k` values in the range.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness

The logic in the program seems correct. Here's a summary of the key points:
- It correctly processes each constraint and keeps track of the bounds and invalid values.
- It checks if the bounds are valid (`bx <= ax`).
- It calculates the number of valid `k` values correctly by subtracting the invalid values within the bounds.

### Conclusion

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the analysis. It handles all the constraints and calculates the number of valid `k` values accurately.

**Correctness: True**
