The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. This affects the values of `a` and `x` as per the input, but it does not change the values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `ax`, or the conditional values of `bx`, `ax`, or `cx` based on the initial conditions provided.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `cx` is a set containing `x`.**
