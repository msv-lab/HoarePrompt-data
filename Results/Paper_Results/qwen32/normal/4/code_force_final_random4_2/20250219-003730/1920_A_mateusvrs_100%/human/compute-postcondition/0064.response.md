Postcondition: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1, `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is the first integer from the input and is not equal to 1, `x` is the second integer from the input. If `a` is equal to 2, then `ax` is set to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing `x`.**
