The given code snippet only executes `cx.add(x)`. According to the initial state, `cx` is a set that contains `x` if `a` is not equal to 1 or 2. Since the code adds `x` to `cx`, and `cx` already contains `x` based on the precondition, the set `cx` remains unchanged. Therefore, no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `cx` is a set containing `x`.**
