Postcondition: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 2, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least one more element that `i` has not iterated over, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `i` is the next element in `cx` that has not been iterated over yet. If `i` is between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, `tmp` is increased by 1.**
