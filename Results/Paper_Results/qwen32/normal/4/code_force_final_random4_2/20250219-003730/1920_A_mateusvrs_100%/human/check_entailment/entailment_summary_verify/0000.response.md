Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the given function summary to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis of the Code

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes a series of constraints and determines the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cx`: A set to store all integers that `k` must not be equal to.
   - `ax`: Initialized to a large value (`1000000000 + 7`) to represent the upper bound.
   - `bx`: Initialized to a small value (`-1`) to represent the lower bound.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint:
     - If the constraint type is `1` (k must be greater than or equal to x), update `bx` to the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`.
     - If the constraint type is `2` (k must be less than or equal to x), update `ax` to the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`.
     - If the constraint type is `3` (k must not be equal to x), add `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Checking Validity**:
   - If `bx` (lower bound) is greater than `ax` (upper bound), it means there are no valid integers `k` that can satisfy all constraints, so the result is `0`.
   - Otherwise, calculate the number of valid integers `k` in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in the set `cx`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, append the result to the list `r` and finally print all results.

### Verification

The code appears to handle all the required cases as per the problem description. Here are the key points to verify:

- **Initialization**: The initial values for `ax` and `bx` ensure that they cover the entire range of possible integers initially.
- **Constraint Processing**: The logic correctly updates the bounds and records the excluded integers.
- **Range Calculation**: The calculation `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` correctly computes the number of valid integers `k` after excluding those in `cx`.

### Edge Cases
- **No Valid Range**: If `bx` exceeds `ax` after processing the constraints, the code correctly returns `0`.
- **No Excluded Integers**: If there are no constraints of type `3`, the code correctly computes the entire range.
- **All Excluded Integers in Range**: If all integers in the range `[bx, ax]` are excluded, the result should be `0`.

### Detailed Verification

Let's verify the logic with the provided example:

#### Example 1:
```
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
- `bx` will be updated to `3` (from `1`).
- `ax` will be updated to `10` (from `1000000007`).
- `cx` will contain `{1, 5}`.
- The range `[3, 10]` has 8 integers: `3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`.
- Excluding `1` and `5`, the valid integers are `3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`.
- The count is `7`, which matches the expected output.

#### Example 2:
```
2
1 5
2 4
```
- `bx` will be updated to `5`.
- `ax` will be updated to `4`.
- Since `bx` (`5`) is greater than `ax` (`4`), the result is `0`, which matches the expected output.

#### Example 3:
```
10
3 6
3 7
1 2
1 7
3 100
3 44
2 100
2 98
1 3
3 99
```
- `bx` will be updated to `7`.
- `ax` will be updated to `98`.
- `cx` will contain `{6, 7, 100, 44, 99}`.
- The range `[7, 98]` has `92` integers.
- Excluding `6, 7, 99`, the valid integers are from `8` to `98` excluding `44`.
- The count is `90`, which matches the expected output.

#### Example 4:
```
6
1 5
2 10
1 9
2 2
3 2
3 9
```
- `bx` will be updated to `9`.
- `ax` will be updated to `2`.
- Since `bx` (`9`) is greater than `ax` (`2`), the result is `0`, which matches the expected output.

#### Example 5:
```
5
1 1
2 2
3 1
3 2
3 3
```
- `bx` will be updated to `1`.
- `ax` will be updated to `2`.
- `cx` will contain `{1, 2, 3}`.
- The range `[1, 2]` has `2` integers: `1, 2`.
- Excluding `1` and `2`, there are no valid integers.
- The count is `0`, which matches the expected output.

#### Example 6:
```
6
1 10000
2 900000000
3 500000000
1 100000000
3 10000
3 900000001
```
- `bx` will be updated to `100000000`.
- `ax` will be updated to `900000000`.
- `cx` will contain `{500000000, 10000, 900000001}`.
- The range `[100000000, 900000000]` has `800000001` integers.
- Excluding `10000`, `500000000`, and `900000001`, the count is `800000000`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code and considering the problem description and potential edge cases, it seems that the program correctly handles all scenarios described.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly processes the constraints, updates the bounds, and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It handles edge cases where there are no valid integers or all integers in the range are excluded.
