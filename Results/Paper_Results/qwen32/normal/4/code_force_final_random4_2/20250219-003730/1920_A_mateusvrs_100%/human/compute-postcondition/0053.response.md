The code snippet assigns a specific value to the variable `ax`. The value assigned is `1000000000.0 + 7`, which evaluates to `1000000007`. The other variables in the initial state (`t`, `r`, `n`, `cx`, and `bx`) are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1; `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, the additional element is `0`. Otherwise, the additional element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`; `n` is an input integer; `cx` is an empty set; `ax` is `1000000007`.**
