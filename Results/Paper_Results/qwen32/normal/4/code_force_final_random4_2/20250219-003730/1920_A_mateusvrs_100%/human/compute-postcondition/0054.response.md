Output State: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1; `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, the additional element is `0`. Otherwise, the additional element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`; `n` is an input integer; `cx` is an empty set; `ax` is `1000000007`; `bx` is `-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `bx` has been updated to `-1`. All other variables retain their initial states as described.
