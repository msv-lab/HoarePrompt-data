Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers as read from the input; `k` is `min(b - a + 1, n)`**

In simple terms, the value of `t` remains `t - 1`, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` stay as they were read from the input. A new variable `k` is introduced and assigned the value of the minimum between `b - a + 1` and `n`.
