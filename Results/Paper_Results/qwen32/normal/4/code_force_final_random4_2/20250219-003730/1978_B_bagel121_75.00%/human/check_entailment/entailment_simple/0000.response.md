### Reasoning:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns under the given promotion rules. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Decision Logic:**
   - If `a >= b`, selling all buns at the usual price `a` will yield the maximum profit since the promotion price `b` is not beneficial.
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the promotional price. The value of `k` is determined as `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This ensures that:
     - `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n`.
     - `k` does not exceed the number of buns that can be sold at a price higher than `a`, which is `b - a + 1`.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the promotional price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a` is `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of `ans` and `p2`.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the calculated maximum profit.

### Verification with Examples:

- **First Test Case (n=4, a=4, b=5):**
  - `a < b`, so `k = min(5 - 4 + 1, 4) = 2`.
  - Promotional profit: `ans = (5 + 4) / 2 * 2 = 9`.
  - Usual profit: `p2 = (4 - 2) * 4 = 8`.
  - Total profit: `9 + 8 = 17`.

- **Second Test Case (n=5, a=5, b=9):**
  - `a < b`, so `k = min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`.
  - Promotional profit: `ans = (9 + 5) / 2 * 5 = 35`.
  - Usual profit: `p2 = (5 - 5) * 5 = 0`.
  - Total profit: `35 + 0 = 35`.

- **Third Test Case (n=10, a=10, b=5):**
  - `a >= b`, so the profit is `10 * 10 = 100`.

All test cases match the expected output, confirming that the program logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
