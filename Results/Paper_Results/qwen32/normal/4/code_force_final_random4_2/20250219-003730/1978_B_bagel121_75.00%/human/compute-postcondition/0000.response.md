Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each of the following t lines contains three integers n, a, and b such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. `t` has been assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been updated to the integer value obtained from the input. The constraints on `t` remain the same. The information about the subsequent lines containing `n`, `a`, and `b` is still valid but has not been affected by this line of code.
