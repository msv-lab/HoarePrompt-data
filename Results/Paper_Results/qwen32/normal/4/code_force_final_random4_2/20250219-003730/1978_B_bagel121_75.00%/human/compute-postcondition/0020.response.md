The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state of `t` is not affected by this code snippet, and the values of `a` and `b` are used in subsequent conditions and calculations.

Since the code only reads the input and assigns the values to `n`, `a`, and `b`, no further changes are made to `t`, and no other variables are introduced or modified by this snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.**
