The code appends a new element to the list `pos`. The new element is calculated as `s - 2 * n`. The initial state of `pos` is `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`. After appending the new element, `pos` will have three elements, all of which are `s - 2 * n`.

The values of `removals`, `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`removals` is 2, `s` is `s - elements[-2] - elements[-2] - elements[-3]`, `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + 3)] - elements[-3]` if no `IndexError` occurs, otherwise `n` is 0, `pos` has elements `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`, `i` is 3.**
