The `IndexError` might be triggered at `n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the index `-(negatives + i)` or `-i` is out of the bounds of the `elements` list. Specifically, if `negatives + i` is greater than the length of the list, or if `i` is greater than the length of the list, an `IndexError` will be raised.

The `try` block attempts to update `n` by adding the difference between `elements[-(negatives + i)]` and `elements[-i]`. If an `IndexError` occurs, the `except` block sets `n` to 0.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `removals` is 1.
- `s` is `s - elements[-i]`.
- If no `IndexError` occurs, `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`.
- If an `IndexError` occurs, `n` is set to 0.

Output State: **`removals` is 1; `s` is `s - elements[-i]`. If no `IndexError` occurs, `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`; otherwise, `n` is 0.**
