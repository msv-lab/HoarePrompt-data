Given the code snippet `s -= elements[-i]`, the value of `s` is decreased by the value of the element at the `-i` index of the list `elements`. The variable `removals` is not affected by this operation.

Since the exact values of `s`, `elements`, and `i` are not specified, we can only describe the change in terms of these variables. The value of `s` will be `s - elements[-i]` after the operation.

Output State: **`removals` is 1; `s` is `s - elements[-i]`**.
