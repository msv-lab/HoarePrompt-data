Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for the game described in the problem statement. The main issue lies in the `func_2` function, which is supposed to calculate the optimal sum after Alice and Bob have made their moves. However, the current implementation is not handling all cases correctly and is hardcoded for a specific case (`removals == 6 and negatives == 3`), which is not appropriate for a general solution.

Here are a few reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Hardcoded Case Handling**: The function `func_2` contains a hardcoded return value of `0` for the case where `removals == 6 and negatives == 3`. This is not a general solution and will fail for other test cases.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Sum Calculation**: The logic for calculating the sum after Alice and Bob's moves is not correctly implemented. The current approach does not account for the optimal strategy for both players. For example, Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum, and Bob should flip the signs of the smallest remaining elements to minimize the sum.

3. **Lack of General Strategy**: The program does not implement a strategy that considers the optimal moves for both players in a general case. It only calculates a few possible sums and returns the maximum, which is not guaranteed to be the correct result.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 2
-1 -2 -3 -4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-2
```

**Explanation:**
- Alice can remove the two smallest elements `-4` and `-3`, leaving the array `[-1, -2]`.
- Bob can then flip the signs of both elements, resulting in `[1, 2]`.
- The final sum is `1 + 2 = 3`.

However, the given program will not produce this output because it does not correctly handle the removal and flipping logic for all possible cases.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and should be revised to correctly implement the logic for both players' optimal moves.
