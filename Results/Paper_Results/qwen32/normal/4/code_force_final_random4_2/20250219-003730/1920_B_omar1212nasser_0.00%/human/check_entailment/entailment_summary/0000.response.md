### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine if the solution is correct.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Alice's Move**: Alice can remove up to `k` elements from the array.
2. **Bob's Move**: Bob can multiply up to `x` elements of the array by -1.
3. **Objective**: Find the optimal strategy for both players to maximize/minimize the sum of the array, respectively.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **func_1()**:
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a`.
   - Sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
   - Calls `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute the result.
   - Prints the result for each test case.

2. **func_2(removals, negatives, elements)**:
   - If `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, it returns 0. This is a hardcoded case and does not cover the general problem.
   - It initializes a list `pos` and calculates the sum `s` of all elements in `elements`.
   - It calculates the sum `n` of the last `negatives` elements in the sorted array.
   - It appends to `pos` the value `s - 2 * n`, which is the sum of the array if all `negatives` largest elements are negated.
   - It then iterates `removals` times, reducing the sum `s` by the largest elements (since they are sorted, these are the last elements) and adjusting the sum `n` accordingly.
   - It appends the new sum `s - 2 * n` to `pos` in each iteration.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from `pos`.

#### Issues with the Code:
- **Hardcoded Case**: The function `func_2` has a hardcoded case for `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3` which returns 0. This is not a general solution and fails for other cases.
- **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for calculating the sum after Alice and Bob's moves is incorrect. The function does not correctly account for the optimal strategy for both players. For instance, if Alice removes elements, Bob's strategy of negating the largest remaining elements is not correctly handled in all scenarios.
- **General Strategy**: The optimal strategy involves considering all possible combinations of removals and negations, which is not addressed by the current implementation.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. The hardcoded case and incorrect logic for calculating the sum after both players' moves indicate that the solution is not general and does not handle all possible inputs correctly.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
