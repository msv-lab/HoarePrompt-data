You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to consider the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. Let's break down the optimal strategy for each player:

1. **Alice's Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array. The best way for her to do this is to remove the smallest `k` elements from the array. This is because by removing the smallest elements, she minimizes the negative impact on the sum.

2. **Bob's Strategy**:
   - After Alice's turn, Bob wants to minimize the sum of the array. His best strategy is to flip the sign of the `x` smallest elements. This is because flipping the smallest positive elements will have the least negative impact on the sum, and flipping the largest negative elements will have the most positive impact on the sum.

The provided program does not correctly implement these strategies. Let's analyze the given code:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - The function reads the input and calls `func_2` for each test case.
  - This part seems correct.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - The function is supposed to compute the optimal sum after both Alice and Bob have made their moves.
  - The function contains a hardcoded condition: `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0`. This condition is incorrect and will not work for all test cases.
  - The function then calculates the sum of the array and the sum of the `x` largest elements (which Bob will negate).
  - The function iterates through possible numbers of removals by Alice, updating the sum and the sum of the elements Bob will negate.
  - The function returns the maximum possible sum after Alice's and Bob's moves.

The hardcoded condition in `func_2` is incorrect and will not work for all test cases. The function should not have this condition and should correctly calculate the optimal sum for any given `k` and `x`.

Correctness: **False**
