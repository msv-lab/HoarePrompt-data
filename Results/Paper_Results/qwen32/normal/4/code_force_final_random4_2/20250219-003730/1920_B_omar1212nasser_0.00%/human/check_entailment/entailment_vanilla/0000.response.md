Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to consider the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. Let's break down the optimal strategy for each player:

1. **Alice's Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array. The best way for her to do this is to remove the smallest `k` elements from the array. This is because by removing the smallest elements, she minimizes the negative impact on the sum.

2. **Bob's Strategy**:
   - After Alice's turn, Bob wants to minimize the sum of the array. His best strategy is to flip the sign of the `x` smallest elements. This is because flipping the smallest positive elements will have the least negative impact on the sum, and flipping the largest negative elements will have the most positive impact on the sum.

The provided program does not correctly implement these strategies. Let's analyze the given code:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - The function reads the input and calls `func_2` for each test case.
  - This part seems correct.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - The function is supposed to compute the optimal sum after both Alice and Bob have made their moves.
  - The function contains a hardcoded condition: `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0`. This condition is incorrect and will not work for all test cases.
  - The function then calculates the sum of the array and the sum of the `x` largest elements (which Bob will negate).
  - The function iterates through possible numbers of removals by Alice, updating the sum and the sum of the elements Bob will negate.
  - The function returns the maximum possible sum after Alice's and Bob's moves.

The hardcoded condition in `func_2` is incorrect and will not work for all test cases. The function should not have this condition and should correctly calculate the optimal sum for any given `k` and `x`.

Correctness: **False**
