The value of `n` is updated by adding the difference between `elements[-(negatives + i)]` and `elements[-i]` to its current value. The values of `removals` and `s` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`removals` is 1; `s` is `s - elements[-i]`; `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`**.

In natural language, this means that `removals` and `s` retain their initial values, while `n` is adjusted by the specified difference in the list `elements`.
