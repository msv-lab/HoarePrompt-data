The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `pos`. None of the other variables (`removals`, `negatives`, `elements`) are affected by this operation. The precondition that `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers and `elements` is a list of integers remains valid. The new variable `pos` is added to the state, and it is an empty list.

Output State: **removals and negatives are non-negative integers, elements is a list of integers, pos is an empty list.**
