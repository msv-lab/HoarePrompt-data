The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `removals`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `removals`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `removals + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. Since the loop iterates from `1` to `removals` (inclusive), the next value for `i` should be `3` for the loop to execute one more time. The value of `removals` remains the same because it defines the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`removals` is 2, `s` is `s - elements[-2] - elements[-2]`, `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-2]` if no `IndexError` occurs, otherwise `n` is 0, `pos` has elements `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`, `i` is 3**
