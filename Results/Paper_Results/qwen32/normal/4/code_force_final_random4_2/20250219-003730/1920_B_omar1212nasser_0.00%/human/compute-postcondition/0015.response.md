The code snippet modifies the variable `n` by adding the difference between `elements[-(negatives + i)]` and `elements[-i]` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so the expression becomes `n += elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-2]`.

Since the initial state does not specify the values of `elements`, `negatives`, or the exact state of `n`, we can only express the new value of `n` in terms of these variables. The new value of `n` will be `n + elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-2]`.

The other variables (`removals`, `s`, `pos`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`removals` is 2, `s` is `s - elements[-i] - elements[-2]`, `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-2]`, `pos` has an additional element `s - 2 * n`, `i` is 2**.
