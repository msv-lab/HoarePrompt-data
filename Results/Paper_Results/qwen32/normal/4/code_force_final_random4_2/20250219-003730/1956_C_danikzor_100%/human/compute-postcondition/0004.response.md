To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, we need to consider the initial state and the print statement.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 500`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

Let's break down the components of the print statement:

1. `2`: This is a constant integer value.
2. `i`: This variable is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its value based on the given information. We will denote its value as `[i]`.
3. `*range(n, 0, -1)`: This is a unpacked range that generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n` down to `1` (inclusive). The `*` operator unpacks the range into individual elements.

Given that `n` can be any integer between 1 and 500, the range will generate a sequence of descending numbers from `n` to `1`.

Putting it all together, the output will start with the number `2`, followed by the value of `i`, and then the sequence of numbers from `n` down to `1`.

Output: **2, [i], n, n-1, ..., 2, 1 (where [i] is the value of the variable i and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500)**
