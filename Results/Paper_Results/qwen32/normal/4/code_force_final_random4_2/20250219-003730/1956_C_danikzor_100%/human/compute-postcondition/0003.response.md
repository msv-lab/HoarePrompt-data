To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the components of the statement and the initial state:

The print statement is:
```
print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

- `1` is a constant integer value.
- `i` is a variable, but its value is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value. We will represent it as `i`.
- `*range(n, 0, -1)` will expand to a sequence of numbers starting from `n` down to `1`. This is because `range(n, 0, -1)` generates numbers from `n` to `1` in descending order.

Given that `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 500`, the sequence generated by `range(n, 0, -1)` will be `n, n-1, n-2, ..., 2, 1`.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output:
- The constant `1`.
- The variable `i`.
- The sequence of numbers from `n` down to `1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1, i, n, n-1, n-2, ..., 2, 1 (where i is the value of the variable i and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500)**
