### Reasoning

Let's carefully evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, the code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. The operations are:
1. Type 1: Fill a row \( i \) with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
2. Type 2: Fill a column \( i \) with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

The optimal strategy is to maximize the sum by placing the highest numbers as frequently as possible in the matrix. The permutation [\( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \)] achieves this by placing the highest number \( n \) in every row and column.

#### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \). It then calculates the maximum possible sum using the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \). This formula is derived from the fact that each row and column is filled with numbers from 1 to \( n \), but the diagonal elements are counted twice when summing the rows and columns separately.

The program outputs this maximum sum and the number of operations, which is \( 2n \) (one operation for each row and one operation for each column).

The operations are described as follows:
- For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), perform a Type 1 operation on row \( i \) with the permutation [\( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \)].
- For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), perform a Type 2 operation on column \( i \) with the permutation [\( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \)].

#### Verification Using Function Summary

The function summary confirms that the program reads \( n \), calculates the maximum sum using the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \), and outputs \( 2n \) operations. Each operation involves filling a row or a column with the permutation [\( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \)].

#### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and the operations needed to achieve this sum. The operations described ensure that each row and each column is filled with the permutation [\( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \)], which is the optimal strategy to maximize the sum of the matrix. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation
