To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the components step by step:

1. **Variables and Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 500`.
   - `i` is set to the value `3`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))`.
   - This statement prints three main components:
     - The constant integer `1`.
     - The variable `i`, which has been set to `3`.
     - The unpacked values from the `range(n, 0, -1)`.

3. **Understanding `range(n, 0, -1)`:**
   - `range(n, 0, -1)` generates a sequence starting from `n` down to `1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.
   - For example, if `n` is `5`, `range(5, 0, -1)` will produce the sequence `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

4. **Combining the Components:**
   - The print statement will first output `1`.
   - Followed by `3` (the value of `i`).
   - Then, it will output the sequence generated by `range(n, 0, -1)`.

5. **Final Output Description:**
   - The output will be a sequence starting with `1`, followed by `3`, and then the numbers from `n` down to `1`.

Putting it all together, the output will be in the form:
Output: **1, 3, n, n-1, ..., 1 (where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500)**

To provide a concrete example, if `n` were `5`, the output would be:
Output: **1, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1**

However, since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we describe it in terms of `n`.

Final Output:
Output: **1, 3, n, n-1, ..., 1 (where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500)**
