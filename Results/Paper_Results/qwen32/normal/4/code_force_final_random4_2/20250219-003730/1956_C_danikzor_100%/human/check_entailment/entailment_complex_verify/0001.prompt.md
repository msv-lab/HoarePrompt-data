You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n×n matrix filled with zeroes. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 500, and the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5.

    #State: The output will consist of `2 * n` lines, where each pair of lines corresponds to an iteration of `i` from 1 to `n`. The first line of each pair is `1, i, n, n-1, ..., 1` and the second line is `2, i, n, n-1, ..., 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` from the input, prints a specific mathematical result based on `n`, and then prints `2 * n` lines, each pair of lines corresponding to an iteration of `i` from 1 to `n`. The first line of each pair contains `1, i, n, n-1, ..., 1`, and the second line contains `2, i, n, n-1, ..., 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. The operations allowed are:
1. Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
2. Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

The optimal strategy to maximize the sum of the matrix is to fill each row and each column with the permutation [\( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \)]. This is because the highest numbers should be placed as many times as possible in the matrix, and this permutation achieves this by placing the highest number \( n \) in every row and column.

### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \). It then calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and the number of operations needed. The maximum sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers, which is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). Since each row and each column will be filled with numbers from 1 to \( n \), the total sum will be the sum of these numbers repeated \( n \) times for rows and \( n \) times for columns minus the overlap (since the diagonal elements are counted twice), which gives us the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \).

The program then outputs this maximum sum and the number of operations, which is \( 2n \) (one operation for each row and one operation for each column).

The operations are described as follows:
- For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), perform a Type 1 operation on row \( i \) with the permutation [\( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \)].
- For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), perform a Type 2 operation on column \( i \) with the permutation [\( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \)].

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and the operations needed to achieve this sum. The operations described ensure that each row and each column is filled with the permutation [\( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \)], which is the optimal strategy to maximize the sum of the matrix. Therefore, the program is correct.
