The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop variable `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken on a value from 1 to `n`, and `n` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than or equal to `n`.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k` (where `1 ≤ k < n`). At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k + 1` is less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 500`, `i` is `k + 1` where `1 ≤ k < n`**

However, to make it more concrete for the next iteration, we can express it as:
State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 500`, `i` is 2**

This assumes that the previous iteration had `i` as 1, which is the first iteration of the loop. For subsequent iterations, you would increment `i` accordingly. But for the very next iteration right after `i` was 1, `i` will be 2.
