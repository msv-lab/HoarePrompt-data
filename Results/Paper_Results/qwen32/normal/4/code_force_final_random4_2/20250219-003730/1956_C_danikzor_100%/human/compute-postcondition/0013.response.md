Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` from the input, prints a specific mathematical result based on `n`, and then prints `2 * n` lines, each pair of lines corresponding to an iteration of `i` from 1 to `n`. The first line of each pair contains `1, i, n, n-1, ..., 1`, and the second line contains `2, i, n, n-1, ..., 1`.**
