Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. The operations allowed are:
1. Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
2. Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

The optimal strategy to maximize the sum of the matrix is to fill each row and each column with the permutation [\( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \)]. This is because the highest numbers should be placed as many times as possible in the matrix, and this permutation achieves this by placing the highest number \( n \) in every row and column.

### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \). It then calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and the number of operations needed. The maximum sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers, which is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). Since each row and each column will be filled with numbers from 1 to \( n \), the total sum will be the sum of these numbers repeated \( n \) times for rows and \( n \) times for columns minus the overlap (since the diagonal elements are counted twice), which gives us the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \).

The program then outputs this maximum sum and the number of operations, which is \( 2n \) (one operation for each row and one operation for each column).

The operations are described as follows:
- For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), perform a Type 1 operation on row \( i \) with the permutation [\( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \)].
- For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), perform a Type 2 operation on column \( i \) with the permutation [\( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \)].

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and the operations needed to achieve this sum. The operations described ensure that each row and each column is filled with the permutation [\( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \)], which is the optimal strategy to maximize the sum of the matrix. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
