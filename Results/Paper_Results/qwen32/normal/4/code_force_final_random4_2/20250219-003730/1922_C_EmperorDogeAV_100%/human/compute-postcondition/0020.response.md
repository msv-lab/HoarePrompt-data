Output State: **`cities` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (with `n` being at least 2) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` in ascending order; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` integers where the `i`-th element is `1` if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, otherwise the `i`-th element is `abs(forward - cities[i])`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` remains the same; if `i > 0`, then `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`; otherwise, `back` remains `-999999999999999999`; `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`.**

In simple terms, the variable `forward` is updated to the next city in the `cities` list. The other variables remain unchanged except for `i`, which is incremented by 1, and `forward`, which is now set to `cities[i + 1]`.
