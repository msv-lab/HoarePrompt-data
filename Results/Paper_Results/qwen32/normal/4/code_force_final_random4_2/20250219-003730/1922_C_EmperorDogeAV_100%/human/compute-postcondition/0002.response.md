The given Python code snippet initializes a variable `back` with a very large negative number. This operation does not affect the existing variables `cities`, `prog_cities`, or `i`.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (with `n` being at least 2) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` in ascending order; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros; `i` is 0; `back` is -99999999999999999999.**
