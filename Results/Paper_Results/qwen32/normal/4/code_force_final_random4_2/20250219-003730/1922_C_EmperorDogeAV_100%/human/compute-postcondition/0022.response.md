The code snippet `prog_cities[i] = 1` directly assigns the value `1` to the `i`-th element of the list `prog_cities`. This does not affect the values of `cities`, `i`, `back`, or `forward`.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (with `n` being at least 2) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` in ascending order; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` integers where the `i`-th element is `1` (previously it was `abs(forward - cities[i])` or `1` based on the condition); `i` is an integer; `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]` if `i < n - 1`, otherwise unchanged; `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`, otherwise unchanged.**
