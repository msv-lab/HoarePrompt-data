### Reasoning:

The given problem involves determining the minimum cost to travel between pairs of cities, where the cost can either be the direct distance between the cities or the cost of traveling to the closest city repeatedly until reaching the destination. The program provided aims to solve this problem by first identifying the closest city for each city and then calculating the cumulative cost of traveling to the closest city in both forward and backward directions.

#### Key Points:

1. **Closest City Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city. It calculates the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - For each city, it calculates the distance to the previous city (`back`) and the next city (`forward`).
   - It then sets the cost in `prog_cities` to `1` if traveling to the next city is cheaper than traveling to the previous city; otherwise, it sets the cost to the distance to the next city.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates prefix sums for both the forward and backward directions. These prefix sums are used to quickly calculate the total cost of traveling through the closest cities.
   - `pref_sum_f` is the prefix sum for the forward direction, and `pref_sum_b` is the prefix sum for the backward direction.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program determines whether to use the forward or backward path based on the relative positions of the cities in the query.
   - It then calculates the total cost by subtracting the appropriate prefix sums.

#### Issues:

1. **Incorrect Closest City Cost Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the cost for traveling to the closest city. The cost should be `1` if traveling to the closest city is cheaper than traveling directly to the destination city. However, the current implementation only checks if the next city is closer than the previous city, which is not sufficient to determine the closest city to the destination.
   - The cost should be determined based on the minimum distance to any city, not just the adjacent cities.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sums are calculated based on the incorrect closest city costs. As a result, the prefix sums do not accurately represent the cost of traveling through the closest cities.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - The query processing logic assumes that the prefix sums correctly represent the cost of traveling through the closest cities. Since the prefix sums are based on incorrect costs, the results of the queries are also incorrect.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified in the closest city cost calculation and the subsequent prefix sum calculations, the program is not correctly solving the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
