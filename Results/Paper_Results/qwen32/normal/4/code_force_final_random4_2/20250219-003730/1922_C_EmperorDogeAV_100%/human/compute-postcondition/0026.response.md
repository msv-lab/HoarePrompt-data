The code snippet assigns a specific value to the variable `back`. The initial state mentions that `i` is incremented by 1, but this does not affect the value of `back` or any other variable in the provided code. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `-99999999999999999999` to `back`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `back` is -99999999999999999999**.
