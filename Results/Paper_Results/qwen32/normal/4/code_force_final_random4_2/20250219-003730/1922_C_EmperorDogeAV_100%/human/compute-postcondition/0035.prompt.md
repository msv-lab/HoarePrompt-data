Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cities` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities, and the second element is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ `a_1` < `a_2` < ... < `a_n` ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    back = -99999999999999999999
    forward = 999999999999999999
    if i > 0:
        back = cities[i - 1]
    if i < n - 1:
        forward = cities[i + 1]
    if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
        prog_cities[i] = 1
    else:
        prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cities` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (with `n` being at least 2) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` in ascending order; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` integers where the `i`-th element is `1` if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, otherwise the `i`-th element is `abs(forward - cities[i])`; `i` is 0 or greater than 0; if `i` is greater than 0, `back` is `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`, otherwise `forward` is 999999999999999999; if `i` is 0, `back` is -999999999999999999 and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`, otherwise `forward` is 999999999999999999.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cities` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (with `n` being at least 2) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` in ascending order. `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` integers where the `i`-th element is `1` if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, otherwise the `i`-th element is `abs(forward - cities[i])`. `i` is an integer, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]` if `i < n - 1`, otherwise unchanged; `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`, otherwise unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` is greater than 0, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `back` remains -99999999999999999999. If `i < n - 1`, `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `forward` remains 999999999999999999`. If `abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)`, then `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to `abs(forward - cities[i])`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
