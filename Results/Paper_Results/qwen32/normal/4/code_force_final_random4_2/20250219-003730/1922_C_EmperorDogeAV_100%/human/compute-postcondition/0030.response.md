Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1. If `i` is greater than 0, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `back` remains -99999999999999999999. `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`.**

In this output state, `forward` has been updated to the value of `cities[i + 1]`. The values of `i` and `back` remain as described in the initial state, with `i` having been incremented by 1.
