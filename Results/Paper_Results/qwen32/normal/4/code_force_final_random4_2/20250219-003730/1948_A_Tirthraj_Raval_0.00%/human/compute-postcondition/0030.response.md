The code appends either 'A' or 'B' to the `pattern` list based on whether the new value of `i` is even or odd. Specifically, it appends 'A' if `i` is odd and 'B' if `i` is even. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so the new element appended to `pattern` is determined by the parity of the incremented `i`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before checking its parity, the new `i` will be the previous `i` plus one. If the previous `i` was even, the new `i` will be odd, and 'A' will be appended. If the previous `i` was odd, the new `i` will be even, and 'B' will be appended.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 49; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `pattern` is a list with the last element being 'A' if the new `i` is even, or 'B' if the new `i` is odd; `i` is incremented by 1.**
