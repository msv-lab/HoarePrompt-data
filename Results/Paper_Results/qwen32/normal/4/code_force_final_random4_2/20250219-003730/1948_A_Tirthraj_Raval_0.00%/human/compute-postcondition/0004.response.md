The given `print` statement in the Python code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

The initial state describes the variables `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is simply outputting the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
