Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 â‰¤ t-1 â‰¤ 49; `n` is an integer. If `n` is odd, `pattern` remains unchanged. If `n` is even, `pattern` is a list containing `n` characters, alternating between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A' if `n // 2` is odd and starting with 'B' if `n // 2` is even. If `n` is even, `pattern` contains exactly `n` characters; if `n` is odd, `pattern` contains `n - 1` characters with alternating 'A' and 'B' pairs.**
