The code snippet `r += a[x]` appends the value of `a[x]` to the string `r`. Given the initial state, `r` is a string that includes `a[x]` appended to it, and `x` is the index of `i` in `b`. After executing the code, `r` will have `a[x]` appended to it again.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least one element, `b` is a list of integers where `b[x]` is incremented by 1, `r` is a string that includes `a[x]` appended to it twice, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, `i` is the next element in the list `s`**.
