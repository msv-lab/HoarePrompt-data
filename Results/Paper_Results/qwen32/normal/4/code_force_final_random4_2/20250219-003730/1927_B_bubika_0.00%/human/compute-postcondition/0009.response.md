The code snippet `b[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `b` by 1. The other variables `t`, `n`, `s`, `r`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `r` is the string representation of `a[x]`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `s`, `b[x]` is incremented by 1.**
