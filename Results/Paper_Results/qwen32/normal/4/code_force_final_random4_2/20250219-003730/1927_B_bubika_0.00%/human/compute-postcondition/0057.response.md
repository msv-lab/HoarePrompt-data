Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer for the last test case, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the last input, `b` is a list of integers where each element represents the total count of the corresponding element in `s` across all test cases, and `r` is a string formed by concatenating characters from `a` corresponding to each element in `s` for the last test case.**

In simpler terms: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the total number of test cases processed. `n` will be the integer input for the last test case. `s` will be the list of integers from the last test case. `b` will have accumulated counts of each integer across all test cases. `r` will be the final string formed by mapping the integers from the last test case to their corresponding characters in the alphabet string `a`.
