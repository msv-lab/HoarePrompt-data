Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

Initial State:
- `t` is falsy (its exact value is not relevant for the print statement).
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `m` is defined as `n - num` and equals 0.
- `dp` is a list `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937]`.
- `i` is set to `k`.
- `num` is the sum of increments based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` in each iteration.
- The current value of `m` is 0.

The print statement in the code is:
```python
print(1)
```

This print statement is straightforward. It does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
