Postcondition: **`t` is truthy, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list where the first 9 elements are [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937] and the rest are zeros if `m` is at least 8, `i` is updated based on the value of `m` (either `i + k` if `m` equals 1 or `m + 1` otherwise), `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the number of times `c == r` and `c != r` occurred in the `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`, and if `m` equals 1, `dp` remains as is with the first 9 elements initialized, otherwise `dp` is a list of `m + 1` values computed using the loop formula.**
