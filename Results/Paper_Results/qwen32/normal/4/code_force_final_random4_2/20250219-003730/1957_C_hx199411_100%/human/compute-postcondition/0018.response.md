The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts those parts into integers, and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The variables `i` and `k` are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, and `k` is greater than the new value of `i`.**

This means `c` and `r` now hold the specific integer values input by the user, while `i` and `k` retain their previous conditions as described in the initial state.
