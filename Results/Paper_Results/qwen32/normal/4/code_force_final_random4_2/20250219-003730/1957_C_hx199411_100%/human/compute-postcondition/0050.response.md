Output State: **`t` is truthy and decremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 1, if `m` is 0, `m` remains 0, if `m` is 1, `m` remains 1, if `m` is greater than 1, `m` is set to 8, `dp` is set to `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937]`, and `i` is set to 9; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, and `c` is equal to `r`.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is incremented by 1, so `num` becomes 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
