Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ `r_i`, `c_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

In this output state, `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input, while all other variables (`n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`) remain as described in the initial state since they have not been modified by the given code snippet.
