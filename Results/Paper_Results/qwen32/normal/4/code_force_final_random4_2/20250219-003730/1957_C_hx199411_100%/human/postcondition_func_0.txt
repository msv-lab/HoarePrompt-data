The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the size of a grid and an integer `k` representing the number of moves made on the grid. It also receives `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` representing the row and column of each move. The function calculates and prints a result based on the moves made, which is either `1` if the remaining cells after accounting for the moves are `0` or `1`, or a computed value using dynamic programming if there are more than one remaining cells.
