The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is truthy and decremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` remains 0 if it was 0, remains 1 if it was 1, and is set to 8 if it was greater than 1, `dp` is set to `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937]`, and `i` is set to 2; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is set to 2. Otherwise, `num` is set to 4.**
