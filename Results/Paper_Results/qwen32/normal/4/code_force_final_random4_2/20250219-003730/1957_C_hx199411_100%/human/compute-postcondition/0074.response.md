The code snippet `dp[2] = 3` updates the value of the element at index 2 in the list `dp` to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is falsy, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 1 (and `m` is not equal to 0), `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3, `i` is `k`, `num` is the sum of increments based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` in each iteration.**
