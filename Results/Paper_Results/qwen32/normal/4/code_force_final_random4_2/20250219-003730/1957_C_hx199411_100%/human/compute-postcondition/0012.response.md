The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the variable `k`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `c` and `r` are integers, and `num` is incremented by 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise by 2. However, these variables are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have taken a specific value, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `k` must be such that `i` is still less than `k`.

State: **`c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is adjusted based on whether `c` equals `r`, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` must be greater than the new value of `i`**
