Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` over the `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`.**

In simple terms, the value of `m` is calculated as `n` minus `num`, where `num` is the result of summing up 1s and 2s based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
