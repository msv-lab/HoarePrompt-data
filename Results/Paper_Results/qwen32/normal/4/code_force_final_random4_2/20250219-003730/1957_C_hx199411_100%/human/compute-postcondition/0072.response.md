The code snippet creates a new list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. This overwrites the previous `dp` list. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `i`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is falsy, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 1 (and `m` is not equal to 0), `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1`, `i` is `k`, `num` is the sum of increments based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` in each iteration.**
