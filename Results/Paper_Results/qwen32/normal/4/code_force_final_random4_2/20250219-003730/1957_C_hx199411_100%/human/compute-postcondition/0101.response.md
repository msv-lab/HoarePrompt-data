The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, and `k` remains the same. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration. Since `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to set `i` back to its value at the start of the previous iteration, which we can denote as `i - 1`. However, since we are only adjusting the state for the start of the next iteration, we simply recognize that `i` has already been incremented to `i + 1` and we need to check if this new `i` is less than `k` for the loop to continue.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` is `i + 1` (from the previous iteration), and `k` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is truthy - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list where the first 9 elements are [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937] and the rest are zeros if `m` is at least 8, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` is the first integer from the new input split, `r` is the second integer from the new input split, and `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 4**
