Output State: **`t` is truthy - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` must be greater than 0, `dp` is a list where the first 9 elements are [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937] and the rest are zeros if `m` is at least 8, `i` is `k` if `m` equals 1, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`, `num` is 2, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split, and `c` is not equal to `r`**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 2, making it 2. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
