Output State: **`t` is truthy - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list where the first 9 elements are [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937] and the rest are zeros if `m` is at least 8, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` is the first integer from the new input split, `r` is the second integer from the new input split, and `num` is 4 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 6**

Explanation: The value of `num` is incremented by 2. Initially, `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 4. After the increment, if `c` equals `r`, `num` becomes 4, and if `c` does not equal `r`, `num` becomes 6. All other variables remain unchanged.
