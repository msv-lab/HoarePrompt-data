Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the final count based on the loop conditions, and `t` is at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `ans` is an empty string; `i` is 0; `work` is True.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the final count based on the loop conditions, `t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is either 0 or 1, `work` is either True or False. If `work` was initially True and `i` is 0, then if `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` is set to False. If `b[i] >= a[i + 1]`, `ans` is set to the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b`, and the loop or if statement is broken out of. If `work` was initially True and `i` is 1, `work` remains True and `ans` is set to the first character of `a`. If `work` was initially False, `ans` is set to the first character of `b`, `i` is set to 1, and `work` is set to False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the final count based on the loop conditions, `t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is either `len(a) - 2` or `len(a) - 1`, `work` is either True or False. If `work` is True, `ans` includes the second-to-last character of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. If `i` is `len(a) - 2` and `work` is True, `ans` also includes the character at index `i` of `b`. If `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` includes the character `b[i]` appended to its previous value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the final count based on the loop conditions, `t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is either `len(a) - 2` or `len(a) - 1`, `work` is either True or False. If `work` is True, `ans` is updated to include the second-to-last character of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` is set to False. If `i` is `len(a) - 2` and `work` is True, `ans` is also updated to include the second-to-last character of `b`. If `work` is False or `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is updated to include `b[len(a) - 2]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
