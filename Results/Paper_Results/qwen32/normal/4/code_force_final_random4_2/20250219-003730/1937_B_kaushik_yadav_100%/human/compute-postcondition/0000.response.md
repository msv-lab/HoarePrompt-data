The code provided only reads a line of input using `sys.stdin.readline`, but it does not process or store this input in any variable. Therefore, the state of the variables does not change based on the given code snippet. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) followed by two binary strings of length n, representing the top and bottom rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
