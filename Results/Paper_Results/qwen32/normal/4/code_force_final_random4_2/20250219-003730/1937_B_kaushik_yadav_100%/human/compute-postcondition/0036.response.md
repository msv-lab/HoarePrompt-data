Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string, and `work` is False. If `work` was initially True, then: if `i` is 0 and `b[0] < a[1]`, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b` and the second character of `a`. If `i` is 0 and `b[0]` is not less than `a[1]`, `ans` is the first character of `b` and the second character of `a`, and `i` is 1. If `i` is 1, `ans` is the first character of `a` and the second character of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` remains False. Otherwise, `i` is set to 1 if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, and if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `work` was initially False, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the second character of `b`, `i` is 2, and `work` is False.**
