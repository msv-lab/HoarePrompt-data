Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is determined based on the initial conditions, `i` is 1 if `i + 1` was not equal to the length of `a`, otherwise `i` retains its initial value, and `work` is False. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
