Postcondition: **`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the final count based on the loop conditions, `t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is either 0 or 1, `work` is either True or False. If `i` is 0 and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` is False. If `i` is 0 and `b[i] >= a[i + 1]`, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b`, and the loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i` is 1, `work` is True and `ans` is the first character of `a`.**
