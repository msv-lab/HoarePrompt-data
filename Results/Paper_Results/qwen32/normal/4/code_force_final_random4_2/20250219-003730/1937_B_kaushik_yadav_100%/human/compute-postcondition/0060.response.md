Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is the final constructed string based on the alternating characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is at least 2, `work` is False. If the character at index `j + 1` in `a` is equal to the character at index `j` in `b`, then `counter` is 2. Otherwise, `counter` is 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, either `a[j + 1]` is not equal to '0' or `b[j]` is not equal to '1', and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
