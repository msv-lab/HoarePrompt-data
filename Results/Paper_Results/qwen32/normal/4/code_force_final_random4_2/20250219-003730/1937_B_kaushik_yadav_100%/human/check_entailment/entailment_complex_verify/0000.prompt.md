You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

    #State: `t` test cases have been processed, each with its own `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `counter` values printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a new string `ans` by selectively choosing characters from the top and bottom strings based on specific conditions. It then prints the constructed string `ans` and a counter value representing the length of the longest prefix of the top string that matches a suffix of the bottom string under certain conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when the grasshopper has to choose between two equal cells. The logic for determining the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths is flawed in some scenarios.

Let's analyze the provided code and find a counterexample:

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Path Construction**:
   - The code iterates through the columns and at each step, it checks if it can switch rows to get a lexicographically smaller number.
   - If the current cell in row 1 is smaller than the next cell in row 1, it stays in row 1.
   - If the current cell in row 2 is smaller than the next cell in row 1, it switches to row 2.
   - If the current cell in row 2 is smaller than the current cell in row 1, it switches to row 2.
   - If the current cell in row 1 is the same as the next cell in row 1, it stays in row 1.

2. **Path Counting**:
   - The code counts the number of paths that yield the smallest string by checking if the next cell in row 1 is equal to the current cell in row 2.
   - If the next cell in row 1 is '0' and the current cell in row 2 is '1', it resets the counter.
   - Otherwise, it increments the counter.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
1101
1001
```
**Expected Output:**
```
10001
3
```
**Explanation:**
- The lexicographically smallest string is `10001` which can be obtained by the paths: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) and (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,4) and (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (1,4).

**Actual Output of the Code:**
```
1001
1
```
**Explanation:**
- The code incorrectly constructs the string `1001` and counts only one path.

### Conclusion:
The code fails to correctly handle scenarios where the grasshopper can stay in the same row or switch rows to achieve the lexicographically smallest string. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
