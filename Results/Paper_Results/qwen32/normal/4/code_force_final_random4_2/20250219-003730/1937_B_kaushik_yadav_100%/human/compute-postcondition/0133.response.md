Postcondition: **`a` is a non-empty string. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, `counter` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is set to 1. In all other cases, either the character at position `j + 1` in `a` is not '0' or the character at position `j` in `b` is not '1', and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.**
