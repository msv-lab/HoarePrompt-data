The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `b` to the string `ans`. 

Given the initial state, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, `counter` is the final value after all iterations, and `ans` is the previous `ans` concatenated with `a[i]`.

After executing `ans += b[i]`, `ans` will now be the previous value of `ans` concatenated with the character at index `i` of `b`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, `counter` is the final value after all iterations, `ans` is the previous `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`.**
