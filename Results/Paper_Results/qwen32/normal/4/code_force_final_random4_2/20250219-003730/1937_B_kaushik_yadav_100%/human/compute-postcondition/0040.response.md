The code snippet `ans += b[i]` concatenates the character at index `i` of the string `b` to the string `ans`. Given that `i` is 0, `ans` will be updated to be the first character of `a` followed by the first character of `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `work` is False, `i` is 0, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b`.**
