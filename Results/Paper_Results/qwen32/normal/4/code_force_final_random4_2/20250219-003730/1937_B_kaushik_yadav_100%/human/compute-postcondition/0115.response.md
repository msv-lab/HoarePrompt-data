The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, `counter` is the final value after all iterations, `ans` is the previous `ans` concatenated with `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, `counter` is the final value after all iterations, `ans` is the previous `ans` concatenated with `a[i]`.**
