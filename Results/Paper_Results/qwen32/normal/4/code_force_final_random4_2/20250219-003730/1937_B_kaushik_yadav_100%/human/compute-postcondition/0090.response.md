Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by the first character of `b`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
