Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is True
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty stripped input string, `b` is the newly stripped input string. If `i` is 0 and `b[0] < a[1]`, then `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b`, `i` is 0, and `work` is False. If `i` is 0 and `b[0]` is not less than `a[1]`, then `ans` is the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False. If `i` is 1, then `ans` is the first character of `a`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string, and `work` is False. If `work` was initially True, then: if `i` is 0 and `b[0] < a[1]`, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b` and the second character of `a`. If `i` is 0 and `b[0]` is not less than `a[1]`, `ans` is the first character of `b` and the second character of `a`, and `i` is 1. If `i` is 1, `ans` is the first character of `a` and the second character of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` remains False. Otherwise, `i` is set to 1 if `i + 1` is not equal to the length of `a`, and if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `work` was initially False, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the second character of `b`, `i` is 2, and `work` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `work` is False. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, the state remains unchanged with `i` as it was. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, then `i` is 0 and `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` but `b[i] >= a[i + 1]`, then `i` is 1 and `ans` is the first character of `a`. If `work` is False, `i` is 1 and `ans` is the first character of `b`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
