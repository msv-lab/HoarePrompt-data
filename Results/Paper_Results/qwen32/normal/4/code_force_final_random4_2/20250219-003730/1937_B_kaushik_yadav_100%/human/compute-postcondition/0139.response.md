Postcondition: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `len(a) - 1`. If `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, then `counter` is incremented by 1. If `a[j + 1] != b[j]` and `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`, then `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
