The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `i` is now `i + 1` (must still be less than `len(a)`), `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, `counter` is the final value after all iterations, `ans` is the previous `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`.**
