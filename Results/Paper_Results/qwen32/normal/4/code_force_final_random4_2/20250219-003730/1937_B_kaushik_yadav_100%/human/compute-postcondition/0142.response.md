The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `counter`. The values of `a` and `j` are not affected by this assignment. The precondition that `a` is a non-empty string and `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `len(a) - 1` remains valid.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is 1.**
