Output State: **`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the final count based on the loop conditions, `t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `work` is either True or False, `ans` is `ans` plus the second-to-last character of `a` plus the second-to-last character of `b` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
