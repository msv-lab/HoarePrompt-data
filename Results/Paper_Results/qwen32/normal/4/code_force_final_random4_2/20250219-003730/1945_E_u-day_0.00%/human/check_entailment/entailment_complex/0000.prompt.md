Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

# Annotated Functions:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`, which is responsible for reading input from the user and returning a map object of integers.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers derived from the user's input, where the input is expected to be a string of space-separated numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a string of space-separated numbers from the user, converts these numbers into integers, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function signature is not provided in the given code snippet. However, based on the context and the problem description, we can infer a possible function signature and its precondition. If we consider a function that might be involved in the process, it could look something like `def rearrange_permutation(p, x):`. In this case, the precondition would be: p is a list representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of converting the return value of `func_1()` to a list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function returns a list that is the result of converting the return value of `func_1()` to a list.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an `i` exists within the range `[0, n-1]`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an `i` exists within the range `[0, n-1]`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is the index where the final `mid` was found or the closest index to `k` if `k` is not in `arr`, `high` is `low + 1`, `st` is a set containing all the `mid` values calculated during the loop.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: low + 1, 0 (where low is the index where the final mid was found or the closest index to k if k is not in arr)
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index `low` where `arr[low]` equals `k` if `arr[low]` equals `k`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is the index where the final `mid` was found or the closest index to `k` if `k` is not in `arr`, `high` is `low + 1`, `st` is a set containing all the `mid` values calculated during the loop. If `arr[low]` equals `k`, then `pos` is set to `low`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` determines the position of an integer `k` within a permutation array `arr` of length `n` and prints whether `k` is found at a specific index or not. If `k` is found, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the index of the closest element to `k` and the original position of `k` in the array.
