Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index `low` where `arr[low]` equals `k`, `low` is the index where `arr[low]` equals `k` if such an `i` exists within the range `[0, n-1]`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `high` is `low + 1`, `st` is a set containing all the `mid` values calculated during the loop. The current value of `arr[low]` equals `k`.**
