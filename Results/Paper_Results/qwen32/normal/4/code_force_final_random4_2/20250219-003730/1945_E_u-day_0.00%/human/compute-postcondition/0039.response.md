Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an `i` exists within the range `[0, n-1]`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is the index where the final `mid` was found or the closest index to `k` if `k` is not in `arr`, `high` is `low + 1`, `st` is a set containing all the `mid` values calculated during the loop, and `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`**
