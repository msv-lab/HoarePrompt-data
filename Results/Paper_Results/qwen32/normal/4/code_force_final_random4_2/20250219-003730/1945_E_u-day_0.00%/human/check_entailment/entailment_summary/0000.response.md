### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to manipulate a permutation array `arr` of size `n` so that after performing at most 2 swaps, a binary search will correctly identify the position of a given number `x` in the array. The binary search algorithm provided in the code snippet does not sort the array before performing the search, which means the array must be rearranged in such a way that the binary search can still correctly identify the position of `x`.

Let's analyze the behavior of `func_3`:

1. **Finding Position of `x`**:
   - The function first reads the size of the array `n` and the number to be found `k`.
   - It then reads the permutation array `arr`.
   - It searches for the position of `k` in the array and stores it in the variable `pos`.

2. **Binary Search Simulation**:
   - The function initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `n-1`.
   - It performs a binary search simulation, keeping track of the midpoints in a set `st`.
   - The loop continues until `low + 1 < high`.
   - If `arr[mid] > k`, `high` is updated to `mid`; otherwise, `low` is updated to `mid`.

3. **Checking the Result**:
   - After the loop, if `arr[low] == k`, it prints `0` indicating that `k` is already at the correct position identified by the binary search.
   - If `arr[low] != k`, it prints `1` and suggests swapping the element at `low` with the element at `pos` (the original position of `k`).

### Issues in the Code:
- The code does not actually perform the swaps suggested in the output. It only prints the indices of the elements to be swapped.
- The code does not guarantee that after performing the suggested swaps, the binary search will correctly identify `k`. The binary search algorithm provided does not account for the fact that the array is not sorted, and the swaps suggested may not correct this issue.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It only prints the indices of the elements to be swapped without actually performing the swaps, and it does not ensure that the binary search will correctly identify `x` after the swaps.

### Correctness: **False**
