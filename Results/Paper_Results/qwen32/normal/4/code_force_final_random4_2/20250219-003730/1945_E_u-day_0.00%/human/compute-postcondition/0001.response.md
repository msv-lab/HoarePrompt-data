`arr` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are the values returned by `func_1()`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n`, and `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`**.
