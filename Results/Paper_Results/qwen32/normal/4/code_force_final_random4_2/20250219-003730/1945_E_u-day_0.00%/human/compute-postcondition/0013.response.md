Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an `i` exists within the range `[0, n-1]`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all `n` iterations, `pos` will hold the index of the first occurrence of `k` in the array `arr` if `k` is found. If `k` is not found in the array within the first `n` elements, `pos` will remain -1.
