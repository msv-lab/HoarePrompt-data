### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, the code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap
The problem requires rearranging a permutation array such that after performing binary search, the element at the final `l` index is equal to `x`. We are allowed to perform at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

#### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program consists of three functions:
1. `func_1`: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
2. `func_2`: Reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers.
3. `func_3`: Handles each test case by:
   - Reading the permutation length `n` and the target value `k`.
   - Reading the permutation array.
   - Finding the position `pos` of the target value `k` in the array.
   - Performing a binary search to find the position `low` where the binary search would end.
   - If `p[low]` is equal to `k`, no swaps are needed (`print(0)`).
   - Otherwise, it swaps the element at `low` with the element at `pos` (`print(1)` followed by the indices).

#### Function Summary Recap
The function `func_3` determines the position of an integer `k` within a permutation array `arr` of length `n` and prints whether `k` is found at a specific index or not. If `k` is found, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the index of the closest element to `k` and the original position of `k` in the array.

#### Correctness Evaluation
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search logic in the program is correct in terms of its implementation, but it does not guarantee that the final `l` index will point to `x` after the search. The binary search is used to find a position `low` where the binary search would end, but this position is not necessarily the position of `x`.

2. **Handling of Swap Operations**: The program only considers one swap operation in the worst case scenario. However, the problem guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient to make the binary search end with `p[l]` being `x`. The program does not explore the possibility of using two swaps to achieve the desired result.

#### Counterexample
Consider the test case:
```
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
The program might output:
```
1
2 3
```
After this swap, the array becomes `[4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 6]`, and the binary search will still not end with `p[l]` being `3`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Identify the position of `x` in the array.
- Perform up to two swaps to ensure that after binary search, the element at the final `l` index is `x`.

#### Conclusion
The provided program does not guarantee that `p[l]` will be `x` after performing at most 2 swaps and running the binary search. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
