### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search.
- We can perform at most 2 swaps to prepare the array for binary search.
- Binary search should end with `p_l` equal to `x`.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1`: Reads a line of input and converts it to a list of integers.
   - `func_2`: Reads a line of input and converts it to a list of integers (same as `func_1`).
   - `func_3`: Handles the main logic for each test case.

2. **Main Logic in `func_3`:**
   - **Finding `x` Position:**
     - The code correctly identifies the position of `x` in the array.
   - **Binary Search Logic:**
     - The code attempts a binary search but does not guarantee that the array will be sorted in a way that a binary search can find `x` after at most 2 swaps.
     - The code performs at most one swap if necessary, but it does not consider the possibility that a second swap might be necessary.

#### Issues in the Code:
- The code does not ensure that the array can be sorted in a way that allows binary search to find `x` after at most 2 swaps.
- The binary search logic is flawed because it does not guarantee the correct placement of `x` after the swaps.

#### Counterexample Analysis:
Consider the test case:
```
1
5 3
5 4 3 2 1
```
- The correct position of `x = 3` is index `2` (0-based).
- The initial binary search will not find `3` because the array is not sorted.
- The code will perform one swap, but it might not be sufficient to make the binary search work correctly.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the code should ensure that after at most 2 swaps, the array is such that a binary search will correctly identify `x`. This might involve more sophisticated logic to determine the correct swaps.

### Conclusion:
The current code does not guarantee that a binary search will correctly identify `x` after at most 2 swaps. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
