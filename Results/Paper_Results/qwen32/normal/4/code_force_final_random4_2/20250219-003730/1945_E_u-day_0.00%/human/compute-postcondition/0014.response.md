The code snippet initializes two variables, `low` and `high`, to `0` and `n - 1`, respectively. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, or `pos`. The output state will reflect the new values of `low` and `high` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an `i` exists within the range `[0, n-1]`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`.**
