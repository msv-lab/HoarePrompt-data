Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index `low` where `arr[low]` equals `k` if `arr[low]` equals `k`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is the index where the final `mid` was found or the closest index to `k` if `k` is not in `arr`, `high` is `low + 1`, `st` is a set containing all the `mid` values calculated during the loop. If `arr[low]` equals `k`, then `pos` is set to `low`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**
