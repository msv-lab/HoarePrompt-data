This function signature is not provided in the given code snippet. However, based on the context and the problem description, we can infer a possible function signature and its precondition. If we consider a function that might be involved in the process, it could look something like `def rearrange_permutation(p, x):`. In this case, the precondition would be: p is a list representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n.
