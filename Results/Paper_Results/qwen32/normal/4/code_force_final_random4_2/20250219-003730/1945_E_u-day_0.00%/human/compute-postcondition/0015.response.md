The given code initializes a new empty set named `st`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the initial state of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, and `high` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an `i` exists within the range `[0, n-1]`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is an empty set.**
