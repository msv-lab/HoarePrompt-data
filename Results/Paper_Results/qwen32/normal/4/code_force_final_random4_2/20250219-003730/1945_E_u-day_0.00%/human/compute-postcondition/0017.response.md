The code snippet calculates the middle index `mid` of the range defined by `low` and `high`. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `n - 1`, `mid` will be `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(n - 1) // 2`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `st`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an `i` exists within the range `[0, n-1]`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is an empty set, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`.**
