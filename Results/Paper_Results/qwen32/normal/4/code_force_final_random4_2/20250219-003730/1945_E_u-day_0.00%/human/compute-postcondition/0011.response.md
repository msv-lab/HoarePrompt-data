The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `pos`. This means that `pos` will now hold the value of `i`, regardless of its previous value. The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, and the condition for `pos` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is `i`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
