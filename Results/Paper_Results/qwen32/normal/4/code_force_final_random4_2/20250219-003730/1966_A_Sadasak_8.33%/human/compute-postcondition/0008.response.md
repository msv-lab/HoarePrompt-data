Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and `frequency_table[num]` is now exactly `k`, `num` is the next element in `arr`.**

In natural language: The value of `frequency_table[num]` has been set to exactly `k`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
