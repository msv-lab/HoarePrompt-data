Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and its value incremented by 1. The current value of `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`.**
