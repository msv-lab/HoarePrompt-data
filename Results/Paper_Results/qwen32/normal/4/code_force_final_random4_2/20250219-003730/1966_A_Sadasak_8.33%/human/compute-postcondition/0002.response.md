The provided code line updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by incrementing the count of `num` by 1. Since `num` is not defined in the initial state, we can infer that `num` is likely an element from the list `arr`. The `frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1` expression ensures that if `num` is not already a key in `frequency_table`, it is added with a value of 1. If `num` already exists in `frequency_table`, its value is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and its value incremented by 1.**
