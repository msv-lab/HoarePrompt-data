Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards you can have after performing the described operations. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not correctly handling the frequency of card numbers, and the main logic does not properly compute the minimum number of cards based on the given operations.

Let's analyze a specific test case to demonstrate why this code is incorrect:

### Test Case Analysis
**Input:**
```
1
10 4
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Expected Output:**
```
3
```
**Explanation:**
- We have 10 cards, all numbered 1.
- We can perform the operation 2 times (since \(10 / 4 = 2\) with a remainder of 2).
- Each operation reduces the count of cards by 1 (since we exchange 4 cards for 3).
- After 2 operations, we will have \(10 - 2 = 8\) cards.
- We can perform the operation one more time, reducing the count to \(8 - 1 = 7\).
- We can perform the operation one more time, reducing the count to \(7 - 1 = 6\).
- We can perform the operation one more time, reducing the count to \(6 - 1 = 5\).
- We can perform the operation one more time, reducing the count to \(5 - 1 = 4\).
- We can perform the operation one more time, reducing the count to \(4 - 1 = 3\).

However, the code does not follow this logic. It incorrectly handles the frequency of card numbers and does not properly compute the minimum number of cards based on the given operations.

### Code Issues
1. **Incorrect Frequency Handling:** The function `func_1` limits the frequency of each card to `k`, which is not the correct approach.
2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards Calculation:** The main logic does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards based on the operations described.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Count the frequency of each card number.
2. For each unique card number, determine how many operations can be performed (i.e., how many groups of `k` cards can be formed).
3. Each operation reduces the count of cards by 1.
4. Sum the remaining cards after performing all possible operations.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    from collections import Counter
    freq = Counter(nums)
    
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += count % k + (count // k if count % k != 0 else 0)
    
    print(min_cards)
```

This corrected code properly handles the frequency of card numbers and computes the minimum number of cards after performing the operations.
