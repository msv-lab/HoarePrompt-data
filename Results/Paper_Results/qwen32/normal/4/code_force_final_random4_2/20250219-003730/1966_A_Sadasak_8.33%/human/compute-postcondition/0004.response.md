The code snippet sets the value of `frequency_table[num]` to `k`. Given that the initial state specifies that `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, after executing this line, the value of `frequency_table[num]` will be exactly `k`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and its value is now exactly `k`.**
