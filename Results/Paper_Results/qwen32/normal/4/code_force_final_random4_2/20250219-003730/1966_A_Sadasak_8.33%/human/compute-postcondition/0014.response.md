Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is a unique number from `arr` and its value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing, `frequency_table` will have each unique number from the list `arr` as its keys. The value for each key will be the count of that number in `arr`, but it will not exceed `k`. If a number appears more times than `k` in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be capped at `k`.
