Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, and `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in arr:
    frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    if frequency_table[num] > k:
        frequency_table[num] = k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, it is now exactly `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, it is now exactly `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards that must have at least 2 integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, it is now exactly `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1. The value of `num` is the next element in `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
