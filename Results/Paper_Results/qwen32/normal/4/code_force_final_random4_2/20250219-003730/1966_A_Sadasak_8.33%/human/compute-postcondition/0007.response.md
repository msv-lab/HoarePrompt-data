The code snippet increments the count of `num` in the `frequency_table` dictionary by 1. If `num` was not already a key in the dictionary, it is added with a value of 1. If `num` was already a key, its value is increased by 1.

Given the initial state, `frequency_table[num]` could either be `k` (if it was previously greater than `k` and was capped to `k`), or any value less than `k`. After executing the code, if `frequency_table[num]` was less than `k`, it will be incremented by 1. If it was already `k`, it will remain `k` as no further increments are allowed according to the precondition.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, it is now exactly `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1. `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
