The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

Given that `t` is greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the loop will print either `p1 - x + p3` where `p1 - x <= p2 - y` or `p3` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.**
