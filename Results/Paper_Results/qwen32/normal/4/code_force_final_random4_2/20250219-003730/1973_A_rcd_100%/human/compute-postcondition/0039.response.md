Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, which means `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(p1 + p2)
```

Since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not specified, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `p1 + p2`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are the first two integers read from the input)**
