The code snippet `y -= 1` decrements the value of `y` by 1. Given the initial state, `y` is initially equal to `p3`. After the decrement, `y` becomes `p3 - 1`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is non-negative, `x` is 1, `y` is `p3 - 1`, and `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`**.
