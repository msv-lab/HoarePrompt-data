### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the final scores of three players in chess games, where the scores are provided in non-decreasing order. The program processes several test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the scores of the three players.

Here's a breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Sum Check**: The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. Since each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2 to the winner, or 1 to each player in case of a draw), the total sum of points should always be even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` indicating that the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - **Case 1**: If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`), the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`. This is because the highest scorer (`p3`) could have drawn all games with the other two players, and the remaining games could have resulted in wins for `p3` against the other two players.
   - **Case 2**: If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws. It initializes `x` to `0` (representing the number of losses for the player with score `p1`) and `y` to `p3` (representing the number of wins for the player with score `p3`). The loop continues as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `x`. Inside the loop, it checks if `p1 - x` (remaining points for the player with score `p1` after accounting for losses) is less than or equal to `p2 - y` (remaining points for the player with score `p2` after accounting for wins for `p3`). If this condition is met, it prints `p1 - x + p3` (the total number of draws). If the loop completes without finding a valid solution, it prints `p3` as the maximum number of draws.

### Correctness:

The program correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem statement and calculates the maximum number of draws or determines if the scores are inconsistent. The logic is sound, and the program covers all possible scenarios described in the problem.

Thus, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
