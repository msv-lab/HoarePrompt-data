The only variables in the loop head are the loop variable `_` and `t`. Since the loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution condition, we only need to adjust `t` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `t` must be greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, ensuring that `t` remains greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the current value of `p3` remains as it is. Otherwise, the value of `p3` is unchanged.**
