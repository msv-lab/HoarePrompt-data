The value of `y` is assigned the value of `p3`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `x` is 0; `y` is `p3`.
