The value of `y` is decremented by 1. Given that `y` is initially at least `x` and `x` is either 1 or 2, the new value of `y` will be at least `x - 1`. The other variables (`t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is non-negative, `x` is either 1 or 2, `y` is at least `x - 1`**.
