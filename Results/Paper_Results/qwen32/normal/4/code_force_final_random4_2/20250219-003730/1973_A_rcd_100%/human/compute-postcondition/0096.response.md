Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it determines and prints a value based on the conditions: if the sum of the scores is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the maximum possible score that can be achieved under specific conditions involving the players' scores.**
