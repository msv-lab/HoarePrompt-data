You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

    #State: A sequence of `t` outputs, each being either `-1` or a calculated value based on the conditions in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it determines and prints a value based on the conditions: if the sum of the scores is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the maximum possible score that can be achieved under specific conditions involving the players' scores.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred in a series of chess games among three players, given their final scores. The scores are provided in non-decreasing order, and we must ensure that the scores are consistent with a valid set of games.

### Key Points:
1. **Total Points**: The sum of all points must be even because each game awards a total of 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1).
2. **Score Constraints**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because the third player could have drawn all their games with the other two players.
   - Otherwise, we need to find a feasible distribution of wins and draws that matches the scores.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and each test case's scores.
2. **Total Points Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the scores cannot be consistent with any set of games.
3. **Direct Draw Calculation**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws. This is correct because the third player could have drawn all their games with the other two players.
4. **Iterative Calculation**:
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws.
   - It initializes `x` (number of losses for player 1) and `y` (number of wins for player 3) and iteratively adjusts these values.
   - The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` ensures that the remaining points for player 1 and player 2 are consistent with the remaining games.
   - If the condition is met, it prints `p1 - x + p3` as the maximum number of draws.
   - If no valid distribution is found, it defaults to printing `p3`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The default case in the loop (`else: print(p3)`) is incorrect. If no valid distribution is found, the program should print `-1` instead of `p3`.
- The loop logic might not cover all edge cases correctly. For instance, it might not handle scenarios where the scores are not achievable with any combination of wins and draws.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the program, we need to ensure that the default case correctly handles invalid score distributions:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            found = False
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    found = True
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1
            if not found:
                print(-1)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the default case in the loop, which should print `-1` instead of `p3` when no valid distribution is found. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
