To determine what will be printed by the `print(p1 - x + p3)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
   - `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
   - If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, then `x` remains 0 and `y` remains `p3`. Otherwise, `x` becomes 1 and `y` becomes `p3 - 1`.

2. **Determine the values of `x` and `y`:**
   - The conditions specify how `x` and `y` are set based on the comparison between `p1 - x` and `p2 - y`.
   - Since `x` and `y` are only set in the context of the comparison, we need to consider the possible outcomes:
     - If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, then `x` remains 0 and `y` remains `p3`.
     - Otherwise, `x` becomes 1 and `y` becomes `p3 - 1`.

3. **Evaluate the print statement `print(p1 - x + p3)`:**
   - We need to determine the value of `p1 - x + p3` based on the possible values of `x`.
   - If `x` remains 0, then the expression becomes `p1 - 0 + p3 = p1 + p3`.
   - If `x` becomes 1, then the expression becomes `p1 - 1 + p3 = p1 + p3 - 1`.

However, since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `p1 + p3` or `p1 + p3 - 1`. But we can describe the possible outcomes based on the conditions.

Given the conditions and the logic, the output of the print statement will be either `p1 + p3` or `p1 + p3 - 1` depending on whether `x` remains 0 or becomes 1.

Output: **p1 + p3 - x (where x is either 0 or 1 based on the condition p1 - x <= p2 - y)**
