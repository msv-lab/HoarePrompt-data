The `while` loop condition is `y >= x`. To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, `y` must be greater than or equal to `x` right before the loop starts.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd
- If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the loop will print either `p1 - x + p3` where `p1 - x <= p2 - y` or `p3` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking
- `x` is 0
- `y` is `p3`

Since `y` is initially set to `p3` and `x` is 0, the condition `y >= x` will be true if `p3` is greater than or equal to 0. Given that `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are scores sorted in non-decreasing order, `p3` being an integer score implies it could be any integer, including negative values. However, in the context of scores, it is generally assumed to be non-negative. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we should ensure that `p3` (and thus `y`) is at least 0.

Since `x` is 0 and does not need adjustment, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `p3` to ensure it is non-negative.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is non-negative, `x` is 0, `y` is `p3`**
