To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, it is part of the precondition).
- `s` is a string provided by the user input and has at least 2 characters.
- `count` is the number of times consecutive characters in `s` have different integer values.
- `flag` is 0 (though `flag` is not used in the provided code snippet, it is part of the precondition).
- `i` is `len(s) - 2`.
- `q` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus the number of iterations (though `q` is not used in the provided code snippet, it is part of the precondition).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(count + 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `count` is described as the number of times consecutive characters in the string `s` have different integer values. However, the problem does not specify what these characters are or their integer values, so we can only describe `count` in terms of its definition.
- The `print` statement outputs `count + 1`.

### Output:
The output will be the value of `count` plus 1, where `count` is the number of times consecutive characters in the string `s` have different integer values.

Output: **count + 1 (where count is the number of times consecutive characters in the string `s` have different integer values)**
