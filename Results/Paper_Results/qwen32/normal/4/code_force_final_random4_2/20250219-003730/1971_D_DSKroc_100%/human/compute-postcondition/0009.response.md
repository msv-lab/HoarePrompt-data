Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `s` is a string provided by the user input and has at least 2 characters, `count` is 1 if the integer value of `s[i]` is not equal to the integer value of `s[i + 1]`, otherwise `count` remains 0, `flag` is 0, and `i` is 0. Additionally, the integer value of `s[i]` is less than the integer value of `s[i + 1]`.**
