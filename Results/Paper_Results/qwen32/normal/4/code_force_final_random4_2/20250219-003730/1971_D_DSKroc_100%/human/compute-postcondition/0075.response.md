Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `s` is a new string provided by the user input and has at least 2 characters, `i` is 2, `q` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If `int(s[i])` is not equal to `int(s[i + 1])`, `count` is increased by 1. If `int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])`, `flag` is set to 1.**
