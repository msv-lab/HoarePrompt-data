Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `s` is a new string provided by the user input and has at least 2 characters, `i` is 0, `q` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If the integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`, then `count` is 1; otherwise, `count` remains 0. `flag` is 0.**
