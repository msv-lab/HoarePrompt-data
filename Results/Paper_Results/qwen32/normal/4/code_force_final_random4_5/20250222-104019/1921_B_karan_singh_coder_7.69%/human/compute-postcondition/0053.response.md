The code snippet provided is `cnt += s[i] != t[i]`. This line increments `cnt` by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are not equal. 

Given the initial state, `i` is `n+1`, but there is a contradictory condition that `n` must be greater than `n+1`, which is impossible. Therefore, the value of `i` is inherently invalid as it cannot be `n+1` if `n` cannot be greater than itself.

However, assuming the code were to run with some valid value of `i`, `cnt` would be incremented based on the comparison of characters at index `i` in `s` and `t`.

Since the condition `n > n+1` is contradictory and cannot be true, the code logically cannot execute as intended. Therefore, the state of the variables remains as given in the initial state except for the logical impossibility of `i` being `n+1`.

Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `n` must be greater than `n+1` (contradictory condition), `s` is the new input string, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`, `i` is `n+1` (invalid due to contradictory condition), `cnt` remains unchanged**.
