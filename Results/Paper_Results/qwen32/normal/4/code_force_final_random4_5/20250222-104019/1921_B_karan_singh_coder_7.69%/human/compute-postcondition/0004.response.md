The code snippet `s1 = s.count('1')` counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. This operation does not affect the values of `t` and `n`, which remain unchanged. The new variable `s1` is assigned the count of '1's in `s`.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input; `n` is the integer value of the input; `s` is the input string; `s1` is the count of '1's in `s`.**
