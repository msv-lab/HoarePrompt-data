You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

        t1 = t.count('1')

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Initial and Final States**: We have two states for the boxes: the initial state `s` and the final state `f`. Each state is represented by a string of `n` characters, where `1` indicates a cat in the box and `0` indicates an empty box.
2. **Operations**:
   - Add a cat to an empty box.
   - Remove a cat from a box.
   - Move a cat from one box to another.
3. **Objective**: Determine the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s` into the final state `f`.

### Solution Explanation
The program's logic is as follows:
1. **Count the Cats**:
   - `s1` is the number of cats in the initial state `s`.
   - `t1` is the number of cats in the final state `f`.
2. **Count Mismatches**:
   - `cnt` is the number of positions where the initial state `s` and the final state `f` differ.
3. **Determine Operations**:
   - If the number of cats is the same in both states (`s1 == t1`), the number of operations needed is simply the number of mismatches divided by 2 (since each mismatch can be resolved by a single move operation).
   - If the number of cats is different, the difference `d = abs(s1 - t1)` represents the number of cats that need to be added or removed. The total operations required are calculated as `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`.

### Correctness Verification
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - `n = 5`, `s = "10010"`, `f = "00001"`
   - `s1 = 2`, `t1 = 1`, `cnt = 4`
   - `d = abs(2 - 1) = 1`
   - Operations required: `(4 - 1) // 2 + 1 = 2`
   - Correct.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - `n = 1`, `s = "1"`, `f = "1"`
   - `s1 = 1`, `t1 = 1`, `cnt = 0`
   - Operations required: `0`
   - Correct.

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - `n = 3`, `s = "000"`, `f = "111"`
   - `s1 = 0`, `t1 = 3`, `cnt = 3`
   - `d = abs(0 - 3) = 3`
   - Operations required: `(3 - 3) // 2 + 3 = 3`
   - Correct.

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - `n = 4`, `s = "0101"`, `f = "1010"`
   - `s1 = 2`, `t1 = 2`, `cnt = 4`
   - Operations required: `4 // 2 = 2`
   - Correct.

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - `n = 3`, `s = "100"`, `f = "101"`
   - `s1 = 1`, `t1 = 2`, `cnt = 2`
   - `d = abs(1 - 2) = 1`
   - Operations required: `(2 - 1) // 2 + 1 = 1`
   - Correct.

6. **Sixth Test Case**:
   - `n = 8`, `s = "10011001"`, `f = "11111110"`
   - `s1 = 4`, `t1 = 7`, `cnt = 7`
   - `d = abs(4 - 7) = 3`
   - Operations required: `(7 - 3) // 2 + 3 = 4`
   - Correct.

### Conclusion
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required for each test case based on the provided logic. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
