t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, a string s of length n consisting of '0's and '1's, and a string f of length n consisting of '0's and '1's. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
