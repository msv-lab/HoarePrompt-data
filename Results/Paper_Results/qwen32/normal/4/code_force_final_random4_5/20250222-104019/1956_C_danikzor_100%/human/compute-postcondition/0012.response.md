Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly. It reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix `a` for that test case. The function processes these inputs and returns no explicit value, but its functionality involves handling the specified number of test cases and the sizes of the matrices as described.**
