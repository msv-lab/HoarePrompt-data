To determine the output of the print statement, we need to understand the values of the variables and the behavior of the `range` function based on the initial state provided:

1. **Variable `i`:** The initial state says that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. However, the exact previous value of `i` is not provided. Let's denote the previous value of `i` as `i_prev`. Therefore, the current value of `i` is `i_prev + 1`.

2. **Variable `n`:** The initial state says that `n` must be greater than `i`. Since `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i_prev + 1`.

3. **Range Function:** The `range(n, 0, -1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n` down to 1 (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. This means the sequence will be `n, n-1, n-2, ..., 2, 1`.

Given the above, the print statement will output:
- The number `1`.
- The current value of `i`, which is `i_prev + 1`.
- The sequence generated by `range(n, 0, -1)`.

Since the exact values of `i_prev` and `n` are not provided, we can't give specific numerical values. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **1, i (where i is i_prev + 1), n, n-1, n-2, ..., 2, 1 (where n is greater than i_prev + 1)**
