The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Given the loop statement `for i in range(1, n + 1):`, the loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and it starts from 1. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1. The value of `n` remains the same unless it is explicitly modified within the loop, which it is not in this case.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k` (where `k` is some integer such that `1 <= k < n`). At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k + 1`**

However, since we don't have the specific value of `k`, we can generalize it by saying that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If we consider the end of the previous iteration where `i` was 3 (as an example), then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 4.

For a general case where we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can say:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**

If we need a concrete example, let's assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 4**

But sticking to the general form:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**
