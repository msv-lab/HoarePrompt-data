Let's analyze the given program in the context of the problem description.

The goal is to maximize the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix using no more than 2n operations. The operations involve permuting elements in rows and columns.

The program provided performs the following steps for each test case:
1. It calculates the maximum sum of the matrix, which is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \).
2. It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations (which is always 2n).
3. It performs n Type 1 operations (permuting each row with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1]).
4. It performs n Type 2 operations (permuting each column with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1]).

Let's verify if these operations correctly maximize the sum of the matrix.

### Verification of the Sum Formula
The formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) is indeed the correct formula for the maximum sum of the matrix. This can be derived from the fact that we want to fill the matrix with the largest possible numbers. The largest possible sum is achieved by filling the matrix with the numbers 1 through \( n^2 \).

### Verification of the Operations
The operations performed by the program aim to fill the matrix with the largest possible numbers. By permuting each row and each column with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1], the program tries to place the largest possible numbers in the matrix.

However, the operations described in the program do not necessarily achieve the maximum sum. The operations performed by the program fill the matrix with the numbers in a specific pattern, but it does not guarantee that the sum is maximized. The correct approach would involve placing the numbers in such a way that the sum is maximized, which typically involves placing the largest numbers in the matrix in a way that they are not repeated unnecessarily.

### Conclusion
The program does not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix as it does not guarantee the optimal placement of numbers. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
