### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if it is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix using no more than `2n` operations. Two types of operations are allowed:
1. Type 1: Assign a permutation to a row.
2. Type 2: Assign a permutation to a column.

The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the largest possible numbers. The maximum sum for an `n x n` matrix filled with distinct numbers from 1 to `n^2` is the sum of the first `n^2` natural numbers, which is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n^2 (n^2 + 1)}{2} \]

However, the provided program calculates the sum using a different formula:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n (n + 1) (4n - 1)}{6} \]

This formula is actually the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers, not the sum of the first `n^2` natural numbers. Therefore, the program is calculating the wrong sum.

#### Operation Analysis:
The program performs `2n` operations:
- For each row `i`, it performs a Type 1 operation with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
- For each column `i`, it performs a Type 2 operation with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

This approach ensures that each row and each column is filled with a permutation of numbers from `n` to `1`. However, the sum calculated by the program is incorrect, so the operations themselves are not maximizing the sum as intended.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it calculates the wrong sum for the matrix and does not maximize the sum of the matrix elements as required by the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
