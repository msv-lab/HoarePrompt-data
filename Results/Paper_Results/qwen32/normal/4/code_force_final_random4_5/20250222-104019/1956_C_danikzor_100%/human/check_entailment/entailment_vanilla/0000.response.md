Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with zeroes using a limited number of operations. The operations involve permuting the rows and columns of the matrix.

### Key Points:
1. **Type 1 Operation**: Choose a row \( i \) and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
2. **Type 2 Operation**: Choose a column \( i \) and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
3. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

### Optimal Strategy:
To maximize the sum, we need to ensure that each element in the matrix is as large as possible. The largest sum we can achieve is when each element in the matrix is \( n \), which gives us the total sum of \( n^3 \). However, since we can only use permutations, the best we can do is to fill each row and column with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to achieve this by performing the following steps for each test case:
1. Read the size of the matrix \( n \).
2. Calculate the maximum possible sum of the matrix, which is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \). This formula is derived from the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers and their permutations.
3. Perform \( 2n \) operations:
   - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), perform a Type 1 operation with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
   - For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), perform a Type 2 operation with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

### Verification:
Let's verify if this strategy works:
- **Sum Calculation**: The formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) is correct for the maximum possible sum achievable with the given constraints.
- **Operations**: The program performs exactly \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
- **Permutations**: The permutations used are optimal for maximizing the sum, as they fill each row and column with the largest possible values.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum and performs the required operations to achieve this sum within the given constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
