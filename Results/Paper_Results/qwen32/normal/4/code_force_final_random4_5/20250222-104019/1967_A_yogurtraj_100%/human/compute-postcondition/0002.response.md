The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `t`, `ii`, `n`, and `k` are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
