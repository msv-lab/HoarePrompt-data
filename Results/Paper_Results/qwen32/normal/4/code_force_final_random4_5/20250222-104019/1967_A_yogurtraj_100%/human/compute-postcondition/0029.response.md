The code snippet provided calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)` and assigns it to the variable `rem`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they were directly affected by the operations within the code snippet. Here's the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `i` is 2, `y` is 0 if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) <= k, otherwise `y` is `n - 2`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `k` is decreased by (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) <= k, otherwise `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
