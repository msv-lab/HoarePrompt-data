The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `i` is 2. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then `y` is `n - 2`, `r` is `a[1]`, and `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`, and `k` is decreased by (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]).**
