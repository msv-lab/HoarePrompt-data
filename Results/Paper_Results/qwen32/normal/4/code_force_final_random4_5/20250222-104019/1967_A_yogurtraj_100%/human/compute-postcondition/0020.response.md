The code snippet `rem = k % (i + 1)` calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` and assigns it to `rem`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is 1, so `i + 1` is 2. Therefore, `rem` will be the remainder of `k` divided by 2.

The other variables (`t`, `ii`, `n`, `a`, `y`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is `k % 2`, `y` is 0, `i` is 1, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`**.
