### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem by distributing the `k` additional cards optimally to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n` (the number of distinct types of cards), `k` (the number of coins to buy additional cards), and the list `a` representing the number of cards of each type.

2. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. This allows the program to distribute the `k` additional cards starting from the smallest number of cards, which is a greedy approach to maximize the number of permutations.

3. **Distributing `k` Coins**:
    - The program iterates through the sorted list `a`.
    - For each element `a[i]`, it checks if the next `i + 1` cards can be equalized to `a[i + 1]` by spending `k` coins.
    - If it's possible to equalize the next `i + 1` cards, it updates the remaining coins `k` and continues.
    - If it's not possible to equalize, it calculates the maximum possible value for the current element `a[i]` after spending `k` coins and breaks the loop.

4. **Final Calculation**:
    - If there are remaining coins `k` after the loop, it distributes them evenly among the `n` cards and calculates the final score.
    - If no coins are left, it calculates the score based on the last value `r` and the remaining coins `rem`.

5. **Output**: For each test case, the program outputs the maximum score.

### Verification:
The program seems to follow a logical approach to distribute the `k` coins and compute the maximum score. It uses a greedy strategy to ensure that the smallest counts are increased first, which is a common and effective approach for such problems.

However, there are a few points to consider:
- The program handles large inputs correctly by using integer arithmetic and breaking early when possible.
- The logic for distributing the remaining coins after the loop is correct.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program appears to correctly compute the maximum score for each test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
