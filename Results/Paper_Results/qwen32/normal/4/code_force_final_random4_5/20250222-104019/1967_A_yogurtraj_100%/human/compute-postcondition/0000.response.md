The only variable in the loop head is `ii`, which is the loop variable, and the range is determined by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be at least 1. This means `t` (the number of test cases) must be at least 1.

The state of `n`, `k`, and `a` are not directly related to the execution of the outer loop, so we do not need to adjust them for the loop to execute. They will be defined within each iteration of the loop.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0 (initial state before the loop starts)**
