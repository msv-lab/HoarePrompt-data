Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 2`, `i` is 1, `r` is `a[1]`, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of all variables remain unchanged, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
