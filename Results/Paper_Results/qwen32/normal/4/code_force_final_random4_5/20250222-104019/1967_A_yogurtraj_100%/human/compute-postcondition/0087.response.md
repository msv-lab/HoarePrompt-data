The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `t`, `ii`, `a`, `rem`, and `y` remain unchanged. The value of `r` is recalculated based on the new values of `n` and `k` after the input is taken.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0. If `k` is not equal to 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. Otherwise, `r` is `a[n - 1]`.**
