Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 3. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is `a[3]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 4`, and `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by `4 * (a[4] - a[3])` and `r` is `a[4]`.**
