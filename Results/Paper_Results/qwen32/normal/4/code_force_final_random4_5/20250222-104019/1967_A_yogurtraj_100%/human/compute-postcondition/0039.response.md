To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the formula involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `ii` is 0 (though `ii` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
- `rem` is 0 (though `rem` is not used in the print statement).
- `y` is 0 (though `y` is not used in the print statement).
- `k` is not equal to 0.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
```

Let's break down the expression step by step:

1. **Calculate `r`**:
   - `r` is defined as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.
   - `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.

2. **Calculate `(r - 1) * n`**:
   - Subtract 1 from `r`.
   - Multiply the result by `n`.

3. **Calculate `k % n`**:
   - `k % n` is the remainder when `k` is divided by `n`.

4. **Combine the results**:
   - Add 1 to the result of `(r - 1) * n`.
   - Add the result of `k % n` to the previous sum.

### Final Expression:
The final expression to be printed is:
\[ (a[n - 1] + \frac{k}{n} - 1) \times n + 1 + k \% n \]

Let's simplify this:
\[ (a[n - 1] \times n + k - n - n) + 1 + k \% n \]
\[ a[n - 1] \times n + k - n + 1 + k \% n \]

### Final Output:
The output of the `print` statement is the result of the above expression, which can be precisely described as:
\[ a[n - 1] \times n + k - n + 1 + k \% n \]

So, the final output is:
Output: **a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 + k % n (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the sorted list `a`, k is the integer obtained from the input, and n is the integer obtained from the input)**
