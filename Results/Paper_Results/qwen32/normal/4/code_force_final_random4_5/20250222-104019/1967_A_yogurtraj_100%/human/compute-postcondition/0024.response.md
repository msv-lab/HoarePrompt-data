Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`**

Natural language: The value of `k` is updated by subtracting the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
