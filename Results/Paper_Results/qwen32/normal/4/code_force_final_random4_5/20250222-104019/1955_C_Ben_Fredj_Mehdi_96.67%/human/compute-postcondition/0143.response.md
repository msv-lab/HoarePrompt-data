Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `z` is `z + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('8')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('8')`. This statement will print the string `'8'` directly to the console. The variables `t`, `a`, and `z` are not used in this print statement; they are part of the initial state but do not influence the output of this specific print statement.

### Output:
Since the print statement is explicitly printing the string `'8'`, the output will be:

Output: **8**
