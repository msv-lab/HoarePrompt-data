Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers where the first element `a[g]` has been decreased by 1, `a[d]` has been decreased by 1, `z` is `z + 1`, `d` is `d - 1` if `a[d-1]` is not 0 after the decrement, otherwise `d` is `d - 2`, `k` is at least 2, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[g]` is 0, then `g` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `d` has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their previously described states.
