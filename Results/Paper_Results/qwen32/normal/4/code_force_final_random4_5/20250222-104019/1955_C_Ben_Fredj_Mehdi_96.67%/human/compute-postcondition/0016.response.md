The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'1'`. The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, or `k` as described in the initial state. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not change based on the values of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `a`, `n`, `k`), but the `print` statement only outputs the string `'1'`.
2. Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables, their values (even though provided) do not influence the output.
3. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'1'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'1'`.

Output: **1**
