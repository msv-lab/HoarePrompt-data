The code snippet increments the variable `g` by 1. Given the initial state, `g` was initially 0, so after the execution, `g` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input line with the first element decremented by 1, the last element of `a` is decremented by 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space, `k` is at least 2, `d` is `len(a) - 1`, `g` is 1, and the current value of `a[g]` (which is `a[1]`) is not specified.**
