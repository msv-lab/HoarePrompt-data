Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting an input string by spaces and converting each part to an integer; `n` and `k` retain their initial values; `k` is not equal to 1999999998, `k` is not equal to 1999999999, `k` is not equal to 99999999999; either `n` is not equal to 1, or `k` is not equal to 10000000000000, or the first element of `a` is not 1; `k` is not equal to 9999999999; it is not the case that `n` is equal to 101 and `k` is equal to 100000000000; `k` is not equal to 10000000000000; `k` is not equal to 99999999999999; `k` is not equal to 199999999999999; `k` is not equal to 1000000000000; and `k` is not equal to 200000000000**
