Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input line; `z` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the first space + 1 to the end of the string; `d` is `len(a) - 1`; `g` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input line with the first and last elements decremented by 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space, `k` is at least 2, `d` is `len(a) - 2` if the last element of `a` is 0, otherwise `d` is `len(a) - 1`, and `g` is 0 or 1 depending on whether the first element of `a` is 0 or not. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state is unknown.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. If no exception occurs, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input line with the first element decremented by 2, the last element decremented by 1, and the element at index `d` further decremented by 1. `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space, `k` is at least 2, `g` is 1 if the first element of `a` was 0 and 2 otherwise, and `d` is updated to `len(a) - 3` if the element at index `d` is 0, otherwise, `d` remains `len(a) - 2` if the last element of `a` was 0, and `len(a) - 1` otherwise. `i` is incremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `g` is decremented by 1 and the element at index `d` is decremented by 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space, `k` is at least 2, `g` is incremented by 1 if `a[g]` was 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` was 0, then `d` is decremented by 1; otherwise, `d` remains unchanged. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
