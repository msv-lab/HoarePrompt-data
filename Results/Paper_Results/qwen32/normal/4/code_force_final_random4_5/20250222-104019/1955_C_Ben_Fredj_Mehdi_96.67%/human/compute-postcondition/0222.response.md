In the given task, we have the following initial state and Python code snippet:

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input line.
- `z` is incremented by 1.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the first space + 1 to the end of the string.

**Python Code Snippet:**
```python
print('10')
```

**Analysis:**
The `print` statement in the code snippet is printing the string `'10'`. The values of the variables `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, and `k` are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely dependent on the string provided within the `print` function.

**Output:**
Output: **10**
