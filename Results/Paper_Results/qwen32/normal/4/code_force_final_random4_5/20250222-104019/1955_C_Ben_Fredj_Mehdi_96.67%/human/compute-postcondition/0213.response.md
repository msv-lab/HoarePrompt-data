Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An input integer where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. **`a`**: A list of integers derived from a new input line.
3. **`z`**: A variable that is incremented by 1 (though `z` is not used in the print statement, it's mentioned for completeness).
4. **`n`**: The integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space.
5. **`k`**: The integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the first space + 1 to the end of the string.

### Print Statement Analysis:

The print statement is:
```python
print('1')
```

### Explanation:

The print statement directly outputs the string `'1'`. The values of `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, and `k` do not influence the content of what is printed. The print statement is hardcoded to output the string `'1'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
