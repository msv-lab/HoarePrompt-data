To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
3. `z` is `z + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('2')`.
- This statement explicitly prints the string `'2'`.

### Variables and Objects:
- The value of `t`, `a`, and `z` are provided in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement only outputs the literal string `'2'`.

### Output:
Based on the given information, the `print` statement will output the string `'2'`.

Output: **2**
