The value of `d` is assigned the length of the list `a` minus 1. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged, and `z` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `z` is `z + 1`; `d` is `len(a) - 1`.**
