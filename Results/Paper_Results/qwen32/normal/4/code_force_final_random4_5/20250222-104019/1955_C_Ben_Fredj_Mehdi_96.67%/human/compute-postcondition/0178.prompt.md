Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `z` is `z + 1`; `d` is `len(a) - 1`; `g` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers where the first element `a[g]` and the last element `a[d]` are decreased by 1 if no exceptions occur, `z` is `z + 1`, `d` is `len(a) - 1` if `a[d]` is not 0 after the decrement, otherwise `d` is `len(a) - 2`, `k` is at least 2, and `g` is incremented by 1 if `a[g]` becomes 0. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. If no exceptions occur, `a[g]` and `a[d]` are decreased by 1. If `a[g]` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1 if `a[d-1]` is not 0; otherwise, `d` is decremented by 2. `z` is incremented by 1, `k` remains at least 2, and `i` is incremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[g]` was originally 0, then `g` is `g + 1` and `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1`. If `a[g]` was not 0, then `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1`. If `a[d]` was originally 0, then `d` is `d - 1` and `a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 1`. Otherwise, `a[d]` remains `int(a[d]) - 1`. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or enclosing control structure.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
