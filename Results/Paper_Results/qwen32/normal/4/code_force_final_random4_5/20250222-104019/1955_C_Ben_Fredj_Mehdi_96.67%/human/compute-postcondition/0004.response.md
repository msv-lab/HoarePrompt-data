The code snippet extracts a substring from `a` starting right after the first space and converts it to an integer, which is then assigned to `k`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the new value of `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is the value provided by the input function; `n` is the integer value extracted from the beginning of `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value extracted from `a` starting right after the first space.**
