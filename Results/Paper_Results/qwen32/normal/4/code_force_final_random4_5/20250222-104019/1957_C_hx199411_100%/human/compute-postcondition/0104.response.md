The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given the initial conditions, `num` is either 2 or 4. After the increment, `num` will be either 4 or 6. 

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `c`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by 1, `i` is 0, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, and `num` is either 4 or 6.**
