Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is `t - 1`, `num` is the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2, `m` is `n - num`, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` is the last first integer from the input, `r` is the last second integer from the input, and `m` is not equal to 0.**
