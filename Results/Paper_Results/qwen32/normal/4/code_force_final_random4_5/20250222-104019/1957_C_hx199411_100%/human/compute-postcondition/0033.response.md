The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on these variables.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `m` is at least 3, because the loop starts with `range(3, m + 1)`. The current state specifies that `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1. However, it does not specify that `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.

So, to ensure the loop executes, we need `m` to be at least 3. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it will be initialized to 3 by the `range` function.

The current state does not mention any specific value for `num`, so we need to ensure that `m` is at least 3, which means `n - num` should be at least 3.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the conditions encountered in each of the `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3**
