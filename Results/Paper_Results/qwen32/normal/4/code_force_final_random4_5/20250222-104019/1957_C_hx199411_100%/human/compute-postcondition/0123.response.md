To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, we need to understand the pattern and behavior of the loop based on the given iterations.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration (`i=3`), `dp` becomes `[1, 3, 5]`.
- After 2 iterations (`i=4`), `dp` becomes `[1, 3, 17]`.
- After 3 iterations (`i=5`), `dp` becomes `[1, 3, 17, 35]`.

We observe that the loop computes each `dp[i]` based on the previous two elements of `dp` and the current index `i`. The loop runs from `i=3` to `i=m`.

Let's describe the output state after all iterations are complete:
- `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- `k` remains the same as the input integer.
- `t` remains the same as the initial value (at least 0).
- `i` will be `m` after the loop finishes.
- `num` remains the sum of 1s and 2s from each of the `k` iterations.
- `m` remains the same as `n - num`.
- `dp` will have `m + 1` elements where the first element is 1, the second element is 3, and the rest are computed by the loop.

The final `dp` list will be fully populated up to `m`.

Given the format required, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is at least 0, `i` is `m`, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s from each of the `k` iterations (i.e., `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`), `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements, where the first element is 1, the second element is 3, and the rest are computed by the loop as `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` for `i` from 3 to `m`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the `dp` list will be fully computed according to the loop's formula, and all other variables will retain their initial values as described.
