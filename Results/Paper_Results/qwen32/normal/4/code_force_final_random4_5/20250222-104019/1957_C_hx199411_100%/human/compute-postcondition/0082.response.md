To determine what will be printed by the `print(dp[m])` statement, we need to understand how the `dp` list is constructed based on the given initial state and the formula provided.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `i` is set to `m`.
2. `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements.
3. `dp[1]` is initialized to 1.
4. `dp[2]` is initialized to 3.
5. For `3 ≤ i ≤ m`, `dp[i]` is calculated using the formula: `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[1] = 1`
   - `dp[2] = 3`

2. **Iterative Calculation:**
   - For `i = 3` to `m`, we calculate `dp[i]` using the given formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)
     \]

### Example Calculation for a Specific `m`:
Let's assume `m = 5` for a concrete example. We will calculate `dp` values step-by-step:

- **For `i = 3`:**
  \[
  dp[3] = (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)
  \]
  \[
  dp[3] = (3 + 2 * 1 * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (3 + 4) \% (10^9 + 7) = 7
  \]

- **For `i = 4`:**
  \[
  dp[4] = (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)
  \]
  \[
  dp[4] = (7 + 3 * 3 * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (7 + 18) \% (10^9 + 7) = 25
  \]

- **For `i = 5`:**
  \[
  dp[5] = (dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)
  \]
  \[
  dp[5] = (25 + 4 * 7 * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (25 + 56) \% (10^9 + 7) = 81
  \]

### General Case:
For a general `m`, the value of `dp[m]` is computed iteratively using the formula provided, starting from the base cases `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value of `dp[m]` computed using the iterative formula starting from the base cases. Since the exact value of `m` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `dp[m]`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the computed value of `dp[m]`.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value computed using the given formula starting from dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3)**
