Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is `t - 1`, `num` is the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2, `m` is `n - num`, `i` is `k - 1` if `m` is 1, otherwise `i` is `m`, `c` is the last first integer from the input, `r` is the last second integer from the input, and if `m` is 1, the function does not modify any additional variables. If `m` is greater than 1, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for `3 ≤ i ≤ m` is calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)**
