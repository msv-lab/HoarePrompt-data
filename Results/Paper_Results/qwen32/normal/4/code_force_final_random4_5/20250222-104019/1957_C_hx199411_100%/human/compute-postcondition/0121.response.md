The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `m + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. To execute the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n
- `t` is at least 0
- `i` is 3
- `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s from each of the `k` iterations (i.e., `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`)
- `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3
- `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements, where the first element is 1, the second element is 3, the third element is 17, and the rest are 0

To proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 4 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is at least 0, `i` is 4, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s from each of the `k` iterations (i.e., `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`), `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements, where the first element is 1, the second element is 3, the third element is 17, and the rest are 0**
