The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `c` and `r` respectively. This means the values of `c` and `r` will change based on the new input, but the values of `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, and the previous `c` and `r` (if any) remain unchanged. The variable `num` will be recalculated based on the new values of `c` and `r`. Specifically, if the new `c` equals the new `r`, then `num` will be set to 1; otherwise, `num` will be set to 2.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by 1, `i` is `k`, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, `num` is 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 2.**
