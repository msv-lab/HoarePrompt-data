### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, the code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Recap:
Nikita can either add or remove one cube from the tower in each move. We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves starting from 0 cubes.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Parity Insight**:
   - If `n` (the number of moves) is even, the final number of cubes `m` must also be even because starting from 0 cubes, an even number of moves will result in an even number of cubes.
   - If `n` is odd, the final number of cubes `m` must be odd because starting from 0 cubes, an odd number of moves will result in an odd number of cubes.

2. **Basic Conditions**:
   - If `n == m`, it's trivially possible.
   - If `n < m`, it's impossible because the maximum number of cubes you can have after `n` moves is `n`.

#### Program Analysis:
Here is the provided program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line does nothing and can be removed
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:  # Incorrect condition, should be b % 2 == c % 2
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Unused Variable**: `q = (b, c)` is unnecessary and does not affect the logic.
2. **Incorrect Condition**: The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect. It should check the parity of `b` (number of moves) and `c` (desired number of cubes) instead of `a` (number of test cases). The correct condition should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2:`.

### Correct Condition Explanation:
- If `b == c`, print 'YES' (trivial case).
- If `b < c`, print 'NO' (impossible to have more cubes than moves).
- If `b % 2 == c % 2`, print 'YES' (parity matches, so it's possible).
- Otherwise, print 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the incorrect condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:`. It should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2:`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the incorrect condition and stating that the program is incorrect. Therefore, we maintain the original assessment.

Final: **False**
