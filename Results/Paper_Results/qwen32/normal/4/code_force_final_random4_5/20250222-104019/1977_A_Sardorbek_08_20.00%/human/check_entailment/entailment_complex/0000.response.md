Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic in the program is flawed, particularly in the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:`. This condition checks if the number of test cases `a` and the number of moves `b` have the same parity, which is irrelevant to the problem.

The correct logic should be:
- If `n` (the number of moves) is less than `m` (the number of cubes), it's impossible to have `m` cubes, so the answer should be "NO".
- If `n` is equal to `m`, it's possible by adding one cube per move, so the answer should be "YES".
- If `n` is greater than `m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes if and only if `n - m` is even. This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) leaves the number of cubes unchanged, and we can add `m` cubes and then perform `(n - m) / 2` pairs of moves (add and remove) to end up with `m` cubes.

Thus, the correct condition should be `elif (b - c) % 2 == 0:` when `b > c`.

Correctness: **False**
