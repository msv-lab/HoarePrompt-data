Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
- `a` is an integer such that a >= 1.
- `b` and `c` are integers read from the input.
- `q` is a tuple (`b`, `c`).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `q`. It simply prints the string 'No'.

### Output:
Output: **No**
