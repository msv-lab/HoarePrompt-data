The code snippet provided contains a single `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q` are described in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q` are all defined with certain constraints, but none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is straightforward and simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **YES**
