Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is an integer such that a >= 1, `b` and `c` are integers read from the input, `q` is a tuple (`b`, `c`), `b` is not equal to `c`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. Additionally, `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2`**
