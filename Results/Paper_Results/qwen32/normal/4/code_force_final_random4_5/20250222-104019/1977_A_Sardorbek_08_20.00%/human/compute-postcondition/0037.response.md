To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the provided loop and the given output states after the first three iterations.

The loop iterates `a` times, where `a` is an integer read from the input. During each iteration, it reads two integers `b` and `c`, and then prints a message based on the comparison of `b` and `c`.

Here's the loop again for reference:

```python
for i in range(a):
    b, c = map(int, input().split())
    q = b, c
    if b == c:
        print('YES')
    elif b < c:
        print('NO')
    elif a % 2 == b % 2:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Key Points:
1. **Loop Iterations**: The loop will execute exactly `a` times.
2. **Variables**:
   - `i`: The loop variable, which ranges from `0` to `a-1`.
   - `b` and `c`: Read from the input during each iteration.
   - `q`: A tuple containing the current values of `b` and `c`.
3. **Output Messages**:
   - `'YES'`: When `b == c`.
   - `'NO'`: When `b < c`.
   - `'Yes'`: When `b > c` and `a % 2 == b % 2`.
   - `'No'`: When `b > c` and `a % 2 != b % 2`.

### Final State:
After all iterations, the loop variable `i` will have reached `a`, and the loop will terminate. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged throughout the loop. The variables `b`, `c`, and `q` will reflect the values from the last iteration.

### Output State:
- `t`: Remains unchanged.
- `n`: Remains unchanged.
- `m`: Remains unchanged.
- `a`: Remains unchanged.
- `b` and `c`: Reflect the values from the last iteration.
- `q`: A tuple containing the values of `b` and `c` from the last iteration.
- `i`: Equals `a` (the loop has completed all iterations).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is an integer such that a >= 1, `b` and `c` are integers read from the input during the last iteration, `q` is a tuple (`b`, `c`) from the last iteration, and `i` equals `a`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `t`, `n`, and `m` stay the same. The loop variable `i` equals `a`, and `b`, `c`, and `q` hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
