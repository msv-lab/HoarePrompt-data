The code snippet assigns the tuple `(b, c)` to the variable `q`. The previous values of `b` and `c` are stored in `q`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `q`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is an integer such that a >= 1, `b` and `c` are integers read from the input, `q` is a tuple containing the current values of `b` and `c`, `i` is increased by 1.**
