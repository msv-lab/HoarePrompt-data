Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\).
- `a` is an integer such that \(a \geq 1\).
- `b` and `c` are integers read from the input.
- `q` is a tuple `(b, c)`.
- `b` is not equal to `c`.
- `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.
- The current value of `a` is such that \(a \% 2\) equals \(b \% 2\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The value `'Yes'` is explicitly given and does not depend on the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `q`. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will always be `'Yes'`, regardless of the specific values of the variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
