The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q`), but these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
2. The variables `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100.
3. The variable `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
4. The variables `b` and `c` are integers read from the input.
5. The variable `q` is a tuple containing the values of `b` and `c`.

None of these variables are referenced in the `print('YES')` statement. Thus, the output will simply be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
