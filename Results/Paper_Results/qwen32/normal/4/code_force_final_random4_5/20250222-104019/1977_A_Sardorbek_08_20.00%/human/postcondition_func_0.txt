The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`. It then prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, and checks if both `a` and `b` have the same parity (both even or both odd) to print 'Yes' if true, otherwise 'No'.
