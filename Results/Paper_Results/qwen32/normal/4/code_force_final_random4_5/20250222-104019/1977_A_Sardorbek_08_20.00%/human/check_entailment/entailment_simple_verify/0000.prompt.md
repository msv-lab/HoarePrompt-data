You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, there are two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is an integer such that a >= 1, `b` and `c` are integers read from the input during the last iteration, `q` is a tuple (`b`, `c`) from the last iteration, and `i` equals `a`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description.

1. **Incorrect Variable Usage**:
   - In the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:`, the variable `a` is used, which represents the number of test cases, not the number of moves `b` or the number of cubes `c`. This condition should instead use `b` and `c` to check if the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves `b` is the same as the number of cubes `c`.

2. **Case Sensitivity**:
   - The problem description states that the output can be in any case (lowercase or uppercase). However, the program uses both 'Yes' and 'YES' interchangeably, which is fine, but the issue lies in the incorrect logic rather than the case sensitivity.

3. **Logic Error**:
   - The logic for determining whether it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves is incorrect. The correct condition should be based on whether `n` is at least `m` and whether the difference `n - m` is even (since each pair of one addition and one removal cancels out two moves).

Let's consider a specific case to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Yes
```

**Actual Output:**
```
No
```

Explanation for the incorrect output:
- In the given input, `n = 5` and `m = 3`.
- The difference `n - m = 2`, which is even.
- According to the problem, it is possible to have 3 cubes after 5 moves (e.g., add 3 cubes and then remove 2 cubes).
- However, the program incorrectly outputs "No" because the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2` is not correctly checking the parity of `b` and `c`.

Here is the corrected logic:
- If `b >= m` and `(b - m) % 2 == 0`, then it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect due to these issues.
