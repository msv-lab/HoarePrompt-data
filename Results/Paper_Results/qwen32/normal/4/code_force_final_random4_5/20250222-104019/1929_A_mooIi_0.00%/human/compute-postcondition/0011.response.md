To determine the output, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
   - This variable represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it is not directly used in the provided code snippet.

2. `n` is the integer provided by the input.
   - This variable represents the number of string integers that will be processed.

3. `ar` is a map object containing sorted string integers from the input.
   - This means `ar` is a map object that contains string representations of integers, and these strings are sorted in ascending order based on their integer values.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(ar))
```
- The `join` method is called on the string `' '`, which means it will concatenate the elements of the iterable `ar` (the map object) into a single string, with each element separated by a space.

### Explanation:
- Since `ar` is a map object containing sorted string integers, when we join these elements with a space, the output will be a string of these sorted integers separated by spaces.

### Example:
If the input string integers were `['3', '1', '4', '2']`, after sorting, `ar` would be a map object containing `['1', '2', '3', '4']`. The `join` method would then produce the string `'1 2 3 4'`.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be a space-separated string of the sorted integer values originally provided as string integers in the input.

Output: **sorted_string_integers (where sorted_string_integers is a space-separated string of the sorted integer values from the input)**
