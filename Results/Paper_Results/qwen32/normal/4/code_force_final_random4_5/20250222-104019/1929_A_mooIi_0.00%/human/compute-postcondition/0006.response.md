The code snippet takes an input string of space-separated integers, converts them to integers, sorts them, and then converts them back to strings, storing the result in `ar` as a map object. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The new value of `ar` is a map object containing the sorted string integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `n` is a new input integer; `ar` is a map object containing sorted string integers from the input.**
