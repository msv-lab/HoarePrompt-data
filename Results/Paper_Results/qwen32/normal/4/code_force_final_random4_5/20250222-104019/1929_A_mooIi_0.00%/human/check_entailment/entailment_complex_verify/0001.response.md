### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task requires calculating the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements optimally, which involves sorting the array in either ascending or descending order and then computing the sum of differences between consecutive elements. However, the given program simply sorts the array and prints the sorted elements as a space-separated string, which is not the required output.

The program should perform the following steps:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   a. Read the length of the array.
   b. Read the array elements.
   c. Sort the array.
   d. Calculate the beauty of the array as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   e. Print the calculated beauty.

The annotated code confirms that the program sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, but it does not calculate or print the beauty of the array as required. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
