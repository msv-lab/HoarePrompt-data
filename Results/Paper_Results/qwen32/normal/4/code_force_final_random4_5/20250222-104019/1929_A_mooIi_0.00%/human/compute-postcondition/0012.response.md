Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; the loop has executed `t` times, with each iteration involving a new input integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each iteration, `ar` is a map object containing sorted string integers from the input list `a`.**

In simpler terms, the loop has finished executing `t` times, where `t` is the initial number of test cases. For each test case, the loop reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, sorts the list, converts each integer to a string, and then prints the sorted list of string integers. After all `t` test cases have been processed, the loop terminates.
