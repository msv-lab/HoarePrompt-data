You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(' '.join(ar))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        
        print(' '.join(ar))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; the loop has executed `t` times, with each iteration involving a new input integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each iteration, `ar` is a map object containing sorted string integers from the input list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and prints them in ascending order as a space-separated string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted array elements, which is not the expected output.

The problem requires rearranging the array elements to maximize the beauty, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. To maximize this beauty, the optimal approach is to sort the array and then calculate the beauty using the sorted array.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            beauty += ar[i] - ar[i-1]
        print(beauty)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version sorts the array and then calculates the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which is the correct approach to solve the problem.
