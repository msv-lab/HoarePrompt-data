The code snippet appends a new value to the list `pos`. The new value is calculated as `s - 2 * n`. Other variables remain unchanged unless they are part of the calculation of the new value for `pos`.

Given the initial state:
- `removals` is at least 5.
- `negatives` is a non-negative integer.
- `elements` is a list of integers.
- `pos` is a list containing three elements: `s - 2 * n`, `s`, and `s - 2 * n`.
- `s` is the previous sum of `elements` minus `elements[-4]` minus `elements[-5]`.
- `n` is calculated based on the last `negatives` elements of `elements` and other specific elements, or it is 0 if an `IndexError` occurs.
- `i` is 5.

The new element in `pos` is `s - 2 * n`. So, the list `pos` now has four elements.

Output State: **`removals` is at least 5, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing four elements: `s - 2 * n`, `s`, `s - 2 * n`, and `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the previous sum of `elements` minus `elements[-4]` minus `elements[-5]`, `n` is the updated sum of the last `negatives` elements plus `2 * elements[-(negatives + 4)] - 2 * elements[-4]` plus `elements[-(negatives + 5)] - elements[-5]` or 0 if an `IndexError` occurs, `i` is 5.**
