The code appends a new value to the list `pos`. The new value is calculated as `s - 2 * n`. Since `pos` initially contains one element `s - 2 * n`, after appending the new value, `pos` will contain two elements: the original `s - 2 * n` and the newly calculated `s - 2 * n`.

Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing two elements `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the previous sum of `elements` minus `elements[-i]`, and `n` is the updated sum of the last `negatives` elements plus `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if no `IndexError` occurs, or `n` is 0 if an `IndexError` occurs.**
