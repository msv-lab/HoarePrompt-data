The code snippet updates the value of `n` by adding the difference between `elements[-(negatives + i)]` and `elements[-i]` to its current value.

Given:
- `removals` is at least 1.
- `negatives` is a non-negative integer.
- `elements` is a list of integers.
- `pos` is a list containing one element `s - 2 * n`.
- `s` is the previous sum of `elements` minus `elements[-i]`.
- `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`.

The line `n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` modifies `n` by adding the difference between the element at index `-(negatives + i)` and the element at index `-i` in the `elements` list.

Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing one element `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the previous sum of `elements` minus `elements[-i]`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `n` has been updated to include the difference between `elements[-(negatives + i)]` and `elements[-i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
