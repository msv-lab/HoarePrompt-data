The code appends the value of `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `pos`, which now contains one additional element, specifically `s - 2 * n`.

Output State: **removals and negatives are non-negative integers, and elements is a list of integers. It is not the case that removals is 6 and negatives is 3; `pos` is a list containing one element, `s - 2 * n`; `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `elements`; `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`.**
