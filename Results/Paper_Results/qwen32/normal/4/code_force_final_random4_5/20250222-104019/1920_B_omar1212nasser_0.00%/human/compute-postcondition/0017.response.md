The `IndexError` might be triggered at `n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the index `-(negatives + i)` or `-i` is out of bounds for the list `elements`. Specifically, if `negatives + i` or `i` is greater than the length of the list `elements`, an `IndexError` will occur.

The `try` except statement is designed to handle the situation where the list `elements` might not have enough elements to support the indexing operations. If an `IndexError` occurs, the variable `n` is set to 0. Otherwise, `n` is updated by adding the difference between `elements[-(negatives + i)]` and `elements[-i]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing two elements `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the previous sum of `elements` minus `elements[-4]`, and `n` is updated to be the sum of the last `negatives` elements plus `2 * elements[-(negatives + 4)] - 2 * elements[-4]` if no `IndexError` occurs, or `n` is 0 if an `IndexError` occurs. `i` is 4.

Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing two elements `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the previous sum of `elements` minus `elements[-4]`. If no `IndexError` occurs, `n` is the updated sum of the last `negatives` elements plus `2 * elements[-(negatives + 4)] - 2 * elements[-4]`; otherwise, `n` is 0. `i` is 4.**
