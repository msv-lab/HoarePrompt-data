The code calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` and assigns this sum to the variable `n`. The values of `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and `elements` is a list of integers. It is specified that it is not the case that `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3. The variable `pos` remains an empty list, and `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `elements`.

Since `n` is now assigned the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`, we update the state to reflect this change. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **removals and negatives are non-negative integers, and elements is a list of integers. It is not the case that removals is 6 and negatives is 3; `pos` is an empty list; `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `elements`; `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`.**
