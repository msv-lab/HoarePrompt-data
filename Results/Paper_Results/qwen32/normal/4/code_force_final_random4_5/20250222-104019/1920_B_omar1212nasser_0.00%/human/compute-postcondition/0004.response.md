Output State: **removals and negatives are non-negative integers, and elements is a list of integers. It is not the case that removals is 6 and negatives is 3; `pos` is an empty list; `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `elements`.**

In simple terms, the variable `s` is now the sum of all integers in the list `elements`. All other variables remain unchanged.
