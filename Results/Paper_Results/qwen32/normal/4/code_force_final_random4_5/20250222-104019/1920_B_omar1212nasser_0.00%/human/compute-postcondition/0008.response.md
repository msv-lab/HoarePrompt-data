The code snippet `s -= elements[-i]` modifies the value of `s` by subtracting the `i`-th element from the end of the list `elements`. To determine the new value of `s`, we need to consider the previous value of `s` and the value of `elements[-i]`.

Given:
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `elements`.
- `elements[-i]` refers to the `i`-th element from the end of the list `elements`.

Thus, after executing `s -= elements[-i]`, the new value of `s` is the previous sum of `elements` minus `elements[-i]`.

Here are the details of the output state:
- `removals` remains at least 1.
- `negatives` remains a non-negative integer.
- `elements` remains a list of integers.
- `pos` remains a list containing one element `s - 2 * n`.
- `s` is now the previous sum of `elements` minus `elements[-i]`.
- `n` remains the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`.

Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing one element `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the previous sum of `elements` minus `elements[-i]`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`.**
