Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_2` includes a hardcoded condition that returns `0` when `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`, which does not align with the optimal strategy for the game as described in the problem statement. This hardcoded condition is likely a mistake and does not generalize to other test cases.

To illustrate, let's consider a test case where the hardcoded condition does not apply:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4 1 1
3 1 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Alice can remove at most 1 element. She should remove the smallest element, which is `1`.
- The array becomes `[3, 2, 4]`.
- Bob can multiply at most 1 element by `-1`. He should multiply the smallest element, which is `2`, by `-1`.
- The array becomes `[3, -2, 4]`.
- The sum of the array is `3 - 2 + 4 = 5`.

However, the program does not produce this output. Instead, it seems to follow a different strategy that does not necessarily lead to the optimal result. The hardcoded condition in `func_2` does not help in finding the correct strategy for this test case or any other general case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
