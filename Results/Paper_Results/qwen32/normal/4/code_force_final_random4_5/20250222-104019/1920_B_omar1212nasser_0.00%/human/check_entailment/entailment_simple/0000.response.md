Reasoning: 
The provided program seems to have a logical flaw in the function `func_2`. Specifically, the hardcoded condition `if (removals == 6 and negatives == 3): return 0` is not a general solution for the problem. This condition will incorrectly return 0 for any test case where `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, regardless of the actual values in the array.

The logic of the program should be to consider all possible ways Alice can remove up to `k` elements and then determine the best way for Bob to minimize the sum by flipping up to `x` elements to negative. The current implementation does not correctly handle the general case and only provides a specific solution for a hardcoded scenario.

To fix the program, the hardcoded condition should be removed, and the logic should be adjusted to correctly compute the maximum possible sum after both players have made their optimal moves. The approach should involve considering different scenarios of element removals by Alice and then calculating the minimum possible sum after Bob's moves, and finally selecting the maximum of these sums.

Correctness: **False**
