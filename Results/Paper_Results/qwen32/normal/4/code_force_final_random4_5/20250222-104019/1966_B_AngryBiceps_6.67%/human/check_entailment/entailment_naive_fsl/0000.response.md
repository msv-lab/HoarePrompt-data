Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly determine whether all squares in the grid can be made the same color using the specified operations. The logic in the code is insufficient to cover all possible cases.

Here is a counterexample where the code fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3 3
WBB
BBW
BWW
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
In this grid, it is possible to make all squares the same color. Here is a sequence of operations to achieve this:
1. Select positions (1, 1) and (3, 3) (both 'W'). This will color the entire grid 'W'.

However, the provided code will output "NO" for this input because it only checks if the first row and the last row are the same or if the first column and the last column are the same. In this case, neither the first row nor the first column is the same as the last row or last column, but it is still possible to make the entire grid the same color.

Therefore, the code does not correctly handle all cases as required by the problem description.
