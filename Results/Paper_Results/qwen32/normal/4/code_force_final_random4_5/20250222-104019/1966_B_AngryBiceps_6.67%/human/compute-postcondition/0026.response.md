Postcondition: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input string, `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each string in `a`, `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each string in `a`, and `i` is `n-1`. If the length of the set of characters in the first string of `a` is 1 and the first string of `a` is not equal to the last string of `a`, the condition in the if block is met. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.**
