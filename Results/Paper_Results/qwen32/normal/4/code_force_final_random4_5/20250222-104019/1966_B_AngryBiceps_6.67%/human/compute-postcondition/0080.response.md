Postcondition: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each string in `a`, `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each string in `a`, `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` has all identical characters and is not equal to the last string in `a`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1 or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.**
