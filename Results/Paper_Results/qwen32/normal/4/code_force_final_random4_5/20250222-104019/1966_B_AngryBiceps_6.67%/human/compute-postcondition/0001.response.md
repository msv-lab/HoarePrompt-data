The given Python code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, but this value is not used in the given code snippet. Therefore, the value of `t` remains unchanged.

The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to `n` and `m`, respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input.**

In simple terms, the output state is that `t` remains the same, while `n` and `m` are assigned the two integers read from the input.
