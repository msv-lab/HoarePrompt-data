The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the `first_row` string. Given that `a` is a list containing one element which is the input string, `a[-1][0]` refers to the first character of that string. 

Since `first_row` was initially an empty string, it now contains the first character of the string in `a`. 

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0**.
