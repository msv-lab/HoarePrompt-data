The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions directly influence the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, or `i`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `t` is described as `t-1`, but this does not affect the `print` statement.
   - `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
   - `a` is a list of `n` input strings.
   - `first_row` is constructed from the first characters of each string in `a`.
   - `last_row` is constructed from the last characters of each string in `a`.
   - `i` is set to `n-1`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - There are conditions related to the uniqueness of characters in `a[0]` and the equality of `first_row` and `last_row`. However, these conditions do not influence the `print` statement.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, the output will always be `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
