### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operation. The program's logic is based on checking if the first row and the last row are uniform and different, or if the first column and the last column are uniform and different. If either of these conditions is met, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

However, this logic is insufficient to cover all cases where it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color. The original assessment correctly identifies that the program fails to consider configurations where the first and last rows or columns are the same, but there are other rows or columns with different colors that cannot be changed using the given operation.

To illustrate, consider a grid where the first and last rows are the same, but there are different colors in between that cannot be changed using the given operation. For example:

```
WBBW
WBWB
WBBW
```

In this case, the first and last rows are the same ("WBBW"), and the first and last columns are the same ("WWWW"). However, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color because the middle rows have different patterns that cannot be changed by selecting two squares of the same color and coloring the subrectangle between them.

The program's logic does not account for such configurations, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided program is **not** correct for all cases.

### Final: **False**
