The given code snippet assigns new values to `n` and `m` by reading a line of input, splitting it into two parts, and converting each part to an integer. This means the previous values of `n` and `m` (which were the second integers read from the input) are overwritten by the new integers read from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each of the `n` input strings, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each of the `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`**.
