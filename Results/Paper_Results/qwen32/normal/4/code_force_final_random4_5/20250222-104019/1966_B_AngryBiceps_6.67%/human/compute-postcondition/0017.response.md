Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input string, `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each string in `a`, `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each string in `a`, `i` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains unchanged as it was initially. `n` is the total number of iterations, which means `a` will have `n` strings appended to it, one for each iteration. `first_row` will be a string made up of the first character of each of these `n` strings, and `last_row` will be a string made up of the last character of each of these `n` strings. The loop variable `i` will be `n-1` after the final iteration, as it starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
