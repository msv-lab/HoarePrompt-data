Postcondition: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is the second integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each of the `n` input strings, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each of the `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`. Either the length of the set of characters in `a[0]` is not equal to 1, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`. Additionally, either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.**
