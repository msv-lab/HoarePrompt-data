The only variable in the loop head of the provided for loop is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`.

Given the state before the loop starts, the relevant state to adjust is the input that will be read by `int(input())`. Since the loop will execute for each test case, we need to ensure that the input value `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.**

Since the other variables (`n`, `m`, and the grid itself) are read inside the loop and do not affect whether the loop executes, they do not need to be adjusted in the state before the loop starts. The state only needs to ensure that there is at least one test case for the loop to run.
