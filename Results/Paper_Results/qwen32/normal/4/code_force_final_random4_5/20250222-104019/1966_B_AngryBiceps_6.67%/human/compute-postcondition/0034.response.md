The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the `first_row` string. 

Given the initial state, `a` is a list containing the first input string, and `first_row` is an empty string. After executing the code, `first_row` will hold the first character of the last element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing the first input string, `first_row` is the first character of the last element in `a`, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0**.
