The `print('Bob')` statement directly outputs the string `'Bob'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, and `ans` as described in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
- The initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but these do not influence the output of the `print('Bob')` statement.
- The `print` function in the code snippet is instructed to print the string `'Bob'`.

Thus, the output is simply the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
