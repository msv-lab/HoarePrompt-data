The code snippet converts the set `s` into a list. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. Since `s` was originally a set containing all unique elements from `arr`, after the conversion, `s` will be a list containing the same unique elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list containing all unique elements from `arr`.**
