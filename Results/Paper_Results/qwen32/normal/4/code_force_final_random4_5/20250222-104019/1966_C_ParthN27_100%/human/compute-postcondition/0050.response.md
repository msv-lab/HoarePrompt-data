To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how the set `s` is updated.

The loop iterates `n` times, and during each iteration, it adds the element at the current index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Since a set only contains unique elements, if any duplicates exist in `arr`, they will not be added again to `s`.

Given the initial state and the output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration, `s` contains `arr[0]`.
- After 2 iterations, `s` contains `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`.
- After 3 iterations, `s` contains `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]`.

Following this pattern, after `n` iterations, the set `s` will contain all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th element.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, and `s` is a set containing all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th element.**

In simpler terms, the set `s` will hold all unique elements from the first `n` elements of the list `arr`.
