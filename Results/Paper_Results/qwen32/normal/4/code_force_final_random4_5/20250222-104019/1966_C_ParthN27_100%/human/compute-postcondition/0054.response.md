The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ans` with the value `1`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet. The initial state of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, and `s` is a sorted list containing `0` as its first element followed by all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th element; `ans` is 1.**
