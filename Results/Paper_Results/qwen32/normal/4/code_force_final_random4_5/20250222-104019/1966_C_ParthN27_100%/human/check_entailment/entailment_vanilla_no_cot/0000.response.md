Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The game is essentially a variant of Nim, specifically the mis√®re version of Nim with a twist on how moves are made. The key to solving this problem is to understand the Grundy number or Nim-sum of the game state, but the provided solution does not take this into account.

The current solution attempts to determine the winner based on a sequence of differences between sorted unique pile sizes, which does not accurately reflect the game's mechanics. The correct approach involves using the XOR operation on the sizes of the piles, which is a standard method for solving impartial games like Nim.

Here's a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for a in arr:
            nim_sum ^= a
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This implementation calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not. If the Nim-sum is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the player who faces a Nim-sum of zero will lose if the opponent plays optimally.
