Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr`, sorted in ascending order, `i` is 3. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` is the result of `ans ^ 1`.**
