The code snippet `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the variable `ans` and the integer `1`. This operation flips the least significant bit of `ans`. If `ans` was `0`, it becomes `1`, and if `ans` was `1`, it becomes `0`.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. Only `ans` is affected by the operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the length of the list `s` and is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is flipped (if `ans` was `0`, it is now `1`; if `ans` was `1`, it is now `0`)**.
