Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `n` is an integer such that (n-2) is odd.
- `ans` is 0 if (n-2) is odd.

However, the `print` statement in the provided Python code snippet does not involve the variables `n` or `ans`. Instead, it simply prints the string `'Bob'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The condition `(n-2) is odd` is given, which determines the value of `ans`.
2. Since `(n-2)` is odd, `ans` is set to 0.
3. The `print` statement is `print('Bob')`, which will output the string `'Bob'` regardless of the values of `n` or `ans`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
