`ans` is assigned the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its current value and `1`. Given that the initial value of `ans` is not provided, we can only express its final value in terms of its initial value. If `ans` was initially `0`, it becomes `1`, and if it was initially `1`, it becomes `0`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr`, sorted in ascending order, `i` is 3, `ans` is the result of `ans ^ 1`.**
