To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the variables and the condition step by step.

### Initial State and Variables:
- `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are mentioned but not defined in the context of the print statement.
- `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are six integers from the input.
- `a` is less than or equal to `c`.
- `x` is calculated as `(c - a) // 2`.
- `r` is calculated as `min(w, b + (c - a) // 2)`.
- `l` is calculated as `max(1, b - (c - a) // 2)`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
```

### Analysis:
The print statement uses a conditional indexing to select between two lists: `['Draw']` and `['Bob']`. The index is determined by the condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`.

Let's break down the condition:
- `l` is `max(1, b - (c - a) // 2)`.
- `r` is `min(w, b + (c - a) // 2)`.
- `x` is `(c - a) // 2`.
- `d` is one of the input integers.

The condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` checks if `d` is within the range `[l, r]` with a margin of `x`.

### Output Determination:
- If `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` is `True`, the print statement will output `['Bob']`.
- If `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` is `False`, the print statement will output `['Draw']`.

Since the exact values of `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not provided, we cannot determine with certainty whether the condition is `True` or `False`. However, we can describe the output based on the given condition.

### Final Answer:
Output: **['Draw'] or ['Bob'] (depending on whether `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` is True or False)**
