Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is decreased by 1; `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are as initially described; `r` is `min(w, d + x)`; `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are the integers from the input; `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`; `l` is `max(1, d - x)`**

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated to be the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. All other variables retain their initial states or previously calculated values.
