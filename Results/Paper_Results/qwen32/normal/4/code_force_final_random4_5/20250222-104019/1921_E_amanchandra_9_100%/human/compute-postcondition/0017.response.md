The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the program. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, which should be decreased by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `t` is decreased by 1; `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are as initially described; `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are the integers from the input. If `a` is greater than `c`, no changes are made to `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, `l`. Otherwise, `r` is `min(w, d + (c - a) // 2)` if `abs(a - c) % 2` is true, otherwise `r` is `min(w, b + (c - a) // 2)`. `a` is less than or equal to `c`. `x` is `(c - a) // 2`. `l` is `max(1, d - x)` if `abs(a - c) % 2` is true, otherwise `l` is `max(1, b - (c - a) // 2)`**.
