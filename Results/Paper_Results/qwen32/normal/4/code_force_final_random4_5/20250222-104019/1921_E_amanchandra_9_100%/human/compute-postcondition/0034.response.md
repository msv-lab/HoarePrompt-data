The value of `r` is updated to the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that is greater than 0, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` remain as initially described, `r` is `min(w, d + x)`, `w` is an integer from the input, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers from the input, `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`, `l` is `max(1, d - x)`**.
