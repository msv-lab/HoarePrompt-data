The given task involves a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, `r`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) and their relationships, but none of these variables are directly used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is simply printing the literal string `'Draw'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and is then decreased by 1, but this operation does not affect the `print` statement.
2. The variables `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, `r`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are mentioned but are not used in the `print` statement.
3. The `print` statement is `print('Draw')`, which means it will output the exact string `'Draw'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, the output is simply the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
