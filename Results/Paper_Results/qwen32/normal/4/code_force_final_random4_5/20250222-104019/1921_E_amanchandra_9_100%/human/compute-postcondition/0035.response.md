To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state provided:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an input integer that is greater than 0.
- `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` remain as initially described (though their exact values are not provided, they are part of the initial state).
- `r` is `min(w, d + x)`.
- `w` is an integer from the input.
- `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers from the input.
- `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`.
- `l` is `max(1, d - x)`.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
```

This line uses tuple indexing to select between two lists based on a condition. The condition is:
```python
abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1
```

If the condition is `True`, the second list `['Alice']` will be selected. If the condition is `False`, the first list `['Draw']` will be selected.

Let's break down the condition:
- `l` is `max(1, d - x)`.
- `r` is `min(w, d + x)`.
- `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`.
- `b` is an integer from the input.

The condition checks if both `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1` are `True`.

### Output Determination:
The output will be either `['Draw']` or `['Alice']` based on the condition.

If the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` is `True`, the output will be:
Output: **['Alice']**

If the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` is `False`, the output will be:
Output: **['Draw']**

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `w`, and `h` are not provided, we cannot definitively determine whether the condition is `True` or `False`. However, we can describe the output based on the condition.

### Final Output Description:
Output: **['Alice'] if abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1, otherwise ['Draw'] (where l = max(1, d - x), r = min(w, d + x), x = abs(a - c) // 2, and b is an integer from the input)**
