Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a rectangle with dimensions `h` and `w`, and two distinct positions `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` within the rectangle. For each test case, it determines and prints the result of a game where two players, Alice and Bob, are positioned at `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` respectively. The result can be 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', based on their positions relative to each other and the dimensions of the rectangle.**
