Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are as initially described; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are the six integers from the input. Additionally, `a` is less than or equal to `c`; `x` is `(c - a) // 2`. The absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd.**
