`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer, and the preconditions for the other variables remain valid.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are as initially described**
