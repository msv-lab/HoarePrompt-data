Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `t` is decreased by 1; `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are as initially described; `r`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are the integers from the input; `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`; `l` is `max(1, b - x)`**

Natural language explanation: The value of `l` is calculated as the maximum of 1 and the result of `b - x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
