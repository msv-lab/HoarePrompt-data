Precondition: **a is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ n), followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
