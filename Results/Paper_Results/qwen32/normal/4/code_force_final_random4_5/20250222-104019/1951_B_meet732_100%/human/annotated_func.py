#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ n), followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `a` representing a test case with an integer `n` (number of cows), an integer `k` (a specific position), and a list of `n` integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. It evaluates the ratings relative to the value at position `k` and returns a value based on the number and positions of ratings greater than the value at `k`. The return value can be `n - 1`, `k - 1`, or a calculated value based on the indices of ratings greater than the value at `k`.
