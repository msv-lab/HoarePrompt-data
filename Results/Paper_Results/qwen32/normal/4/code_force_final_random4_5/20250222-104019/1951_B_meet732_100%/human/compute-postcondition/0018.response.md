The code snippet `ind.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `ind`. Given the initial state, `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and `ind` is a list that collects indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than `x`. After executing `ind.append(i)`, the list `ind` will now include the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) and an integer `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`), followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). `x` is the value of `a[k]` for the current test case. `ind` is a list containing the value `i` if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, and now includes the current value of `i`. `i` is `i + 1`.**
