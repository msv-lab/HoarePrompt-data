The code snippet `x = a[k]` assigns the value of the element at index `k` of the list `a` to the variable `x`. Given that `a` is a list of test cases, where each test case is structured as described, `k` is a 1-based index into the list of Cowdeforces ratings for a specific test case. Therefore, `x` will be assigned the value of the `k`-th element in the list of ratings for the current test case.

Output State: **`a` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) and an integer `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`), followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `x` is the value of `a[k]` for the current test case.**
