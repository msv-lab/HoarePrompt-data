The code snippet provided is `c += 1`, which increments the value of the variable `c` by 1. The other variables (`a`, `x`, `ind`, `i`, `n`, `k`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) and an integer `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`), followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). `x` is the value of `a[k]` for the current test case. `ind` is a list containing the value `i` if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, and now includes the current value of `i`. `i` is `i + 1`. `c` is incremented by 1.**
