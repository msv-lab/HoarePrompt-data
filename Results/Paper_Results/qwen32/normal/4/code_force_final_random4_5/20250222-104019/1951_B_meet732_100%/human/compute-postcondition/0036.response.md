Postcondition: **`a` is a list of test cases, `x` is the value of `a[k]` for the current test case, `ind` is a list containing up to 2 indices where `a[i] > x`, and `c` is the number of such indices (either 0, 1, or 2). The length of `ind` is not equal to 1, and `ind` is not an empty list. The current value of `ind[0]` is 0.**
