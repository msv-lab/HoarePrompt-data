The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `ind`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables (`a`, `n`, `k`, `x`). Therefore, the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) and an integer `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`), followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `x` is the value of `a[k]` for the current test case; `ind` is an empty list.**
