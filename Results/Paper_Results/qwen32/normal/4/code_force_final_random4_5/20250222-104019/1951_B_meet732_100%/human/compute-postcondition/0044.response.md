Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a list `a` representing a test case with an integer `n` (number of cows), an integer `k` (a specific position), and a list of `n` integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. It evaluates the ratings relative to the value at position `k` and returns a value based on the number and positions of ratings greater than the value at `k`. The return value can be `n - 1`, `k - 1`, or a calculated value based on the indices of ratings greater than the value at `k`.**
