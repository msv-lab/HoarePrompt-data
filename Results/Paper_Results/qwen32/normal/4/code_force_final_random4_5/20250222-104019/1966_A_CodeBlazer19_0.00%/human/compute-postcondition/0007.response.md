The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `l`. 

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The variable `l` is updated to hold the list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `i` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the split and mapped input.**
