The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state indicates that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 500, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, and `l` is a list of integers obtained from the split and mapped input.

The code snippet will update the values of `n` and `k` based on the new input. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `i` also remains unchanged. The variable `l` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `i` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the split and mapped input.**

In simpler terms, `n` and `k` are updated to the new input values, while `t`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged.
