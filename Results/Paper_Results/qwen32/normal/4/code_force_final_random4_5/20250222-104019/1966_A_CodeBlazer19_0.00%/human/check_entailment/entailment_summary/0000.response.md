Reasoning:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic of the code is to print `k - 1` for each test case, regardless of the input values `n` and the list `c`. This is incorrect because the minimum number of cards left in the hand depends on the frequency of each card number and the value of `k`.

The core idea of the problem is to reduce the number of cards by repeatedly exchanging `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards. The optimal strategy involves reducing the frequency of the most common cards first. However, the code provided does not implement any logic to calculate this minimum number of cards.

The correct approach would involve counting the frequency of each card, then using a greedy strategy to reduce the number of cards by performing the allowed operations as many times as possible.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, it is clear that the code is not following the correct logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
