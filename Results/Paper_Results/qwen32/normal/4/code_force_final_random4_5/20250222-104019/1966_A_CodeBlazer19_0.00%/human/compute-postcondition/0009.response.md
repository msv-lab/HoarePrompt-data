The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the split and mapped input.**
