Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. This variable represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
2. **`i`**: Set to the integer value 2. This variable is also not directly used in the provided code snippet.
3. **`n`**: The first integer from a new input. This integer could be any value, but it's not utilized in the provided code snippet.
4. **`k`**: The second integer from a new input. This integer is used in the provided code snippet.
5. **`l`**: A list of integers obtained from the split and mapped input. This list is also not utilized in the provided code snippet.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k - 1)
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet simply prints the value of `k - 1`. Given that `k` is the second integer from a new input, we can denote the value of `k` as some arbitrary integer, say `k_value`. Therefore, the expression `k - 1` will evaluate to `k_value - 1`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(k - 1)` statement will output the value of `k` minus 1.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is the second integer from the new input)**
