Reasoning:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program simply prints `k - 1` for each test case, regardless of the input values for `n` and the list of card numbers. This is incorrect because the minimum number of cards left can vary based on the frequency of each card number and the value of `k`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine the frequency of each card number and then use the operation to reduce the number of cards as much as possible. The key insight is that for any card number that appears `x` times, we can reduce the number of cards by performing the operation until we are left with `x % (k-1)` cards of that number. The final answer is the sum of `x % (k-1)` for all card numbers, or 1 if this sum is 0 (since we can't have 0 cards).

Here's a correct approach:
1. Count the frequency of each card number.
2. For each unique card number, calculate the remainder when its frequency is divided by `k-1`.
3. Sum these remainders.
4. If the sum is 0, the result is 1 (since we can't have 0 cards); otherwise, the result is the sum.

Given the incorrect implementation in the program, the program is not solving the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
