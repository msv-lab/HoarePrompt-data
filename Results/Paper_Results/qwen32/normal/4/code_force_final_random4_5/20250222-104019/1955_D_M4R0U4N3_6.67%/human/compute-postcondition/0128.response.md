Output State: **`done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, except `old` if `old` is in `done`, and `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. `a[r]` is added to `done`. `extra` includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. If `old` is in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, `todo` includes `old`. `n` remains unchanged, `m` is less than `n`, `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `old` is `a[r - m]`. `todo` does not include `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`. `ans` is 3 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2. `r` is `m + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables and their conditions remain the same as described in the initial state.
