The code snippet `done = set()` initializes the variable `done` as an empty set. This does not affect the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will have `done` as an empty set while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`done` is an empty set; `todo` contains unique integers from the input; `extra` contains elements not originally in `todo` and not moved to `done`; `ans` reflects the number of times `len(done) >= k`; `n` is the first input integer; `m` is the second input integer; `k` is the third input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
