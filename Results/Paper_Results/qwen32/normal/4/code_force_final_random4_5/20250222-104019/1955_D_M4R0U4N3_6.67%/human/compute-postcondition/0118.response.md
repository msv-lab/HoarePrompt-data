The given code snippet is `old = a[r - m]`. This line reassigns the value of `old` to the element at index `r - m` in the array `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `old` is `a[r - m]`.
- `r` is `m + 1`.

After executing the code snippet, the value of `old` remains the same as it was before because `old` is already defined as `a[r - m]` and the line reassigns `old` to the same value.

Thus, the Output State is the same as the Initial State with respect to the variables mentioned, as no other variables are affected and `old` retains its value.

Output State: **`done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, except `old` if `old` is in `done`. `a[r]` is not in `todo`, so `a[r]` is added to `done`. `extra` includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`, and remains unchanged otherwise. `n` remains unchanged. `m` is less than `n`. `k` remains unchanged. `a` remains unchanged. `old` is `a[r - m]`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1. `r` is `m + 1`.**
