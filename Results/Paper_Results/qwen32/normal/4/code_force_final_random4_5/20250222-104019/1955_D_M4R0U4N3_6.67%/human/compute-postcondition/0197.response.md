The code adds the value of `a[r]` to the set `done`. This means that `done` now contains the value of `a[r]` in addition to any values it previously held. The values of `r`, `old`, `extra`, and `todo` remain unchanged unless they were dependent on the value of `a[r]` being added to `done`.

Output State: **`r` is incremented by 1; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` has `old` removed from it. Otherwise, if `old` is in `done`, `done` does not contain the value of `old` and `todo` contains the value of `old` except `a[r]` has been removed from `todo`. `done` contains the value of `a[r]`.**
