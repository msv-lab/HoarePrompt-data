Postcondition: **`done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, `todo` is an empty set, `extra` is the set of all elements from `a` that were not originally in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `m` must be less than `n`, `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `old` is not in `extra`, and `old` is in `done`.**
