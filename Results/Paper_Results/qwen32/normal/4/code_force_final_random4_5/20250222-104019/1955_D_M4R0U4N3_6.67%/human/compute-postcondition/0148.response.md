The code snippet `todo = set(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into a list of substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and then converts the list of integers into a set. This means that `todo` will now contain unique integers that were part of the input.

Output State: **`done` contains elements processed and in `done` after all iterations; `todo` contains unique integers from the input; `extra` contains elements not originally in `todo` and not moved to `done`; `ans` reflects the number of times `len(done) >= k`; `n` is the first input integer; `m` is the second input integer; `k` is the third input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
