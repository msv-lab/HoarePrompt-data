The only variable in the loop head is `r`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `r` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `r` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `r` must be incremented by 1 again, making it `r + 1`, and it must still be less than `n`.

State: **`r` is `r + 1`, `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` has `old` removed from it. Otherwise, if `old` is in `done`, `done` does not contain the value of `old` and `todo` contains the value of `old`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `a[r]` is added to `extra`. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.** 

However, since we are only adjusting the loop head variable, the final state we need to specify is just the value of `r`:

State: **`r` is `r + 1`**
