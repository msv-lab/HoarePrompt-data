Postcondition: **`done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, except `old` if `old` is in `done`, and `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. If `old` is in `done`, it is removed from `done` and `todo` includes `old`. `a[r]` is added to `done`. `extra` includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. If `old` is in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. `n` remains unchanged, `m` is less than `n`, `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `old` is `a[2]`. `todo` does not include `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 3; otherwise, `ans` is 2. `r` is `m + 2`. If `old` is not in `done`, no changes are made to `done`, `extra`, `todo`, `ans` remains 2.**
