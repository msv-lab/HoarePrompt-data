Output State: **`done` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` and processed; `todo` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` but not processed; `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo`; `ans` is 1 if `len(done) >= k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `m` must be less than `n`; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`.**

Explanation: The variable `old` is assigned the value of the element in list `a` at the index `r - m`. The values of `done`, `todo`, `extra`, `ans`, `m`, and `n` remain unchanged.
