The code snippet `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element at index `j` of the list `a` to the set `extra`. This means that the set `extra` will now include the element `a[j]` if it was not already present.

Output State: **`done`, `todo`, `extra` includes `a[j]`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are defined as per the initial conditions, `j` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the set `extra` now contains the element `a[j]`, and `j` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain as they were initially defined.
