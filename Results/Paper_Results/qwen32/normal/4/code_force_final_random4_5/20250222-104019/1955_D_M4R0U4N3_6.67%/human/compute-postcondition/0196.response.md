The code snippet `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the value of `a[r]` from the list `todo`. Given the initial state, we know that `r` has been incremented by 1 and `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it was removed from `extra`. Otherwise, if `old` was in `done`, it was not in `done` anymore but was in `todo`.

Since `todo.remove(a[r])` is executed, the value `a[r]` is removed from `todo`. The other variables (`r`, `old`, `a`, `extra`, `done`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions unless they are directly affected by the operation.

Output State: **`r` is incremented by 1; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` has `old` removed from it. Otherwise, if `old` is in `done`, `done` does not contain the value of `old` and `todo` contains the value of `old` except `a[r]` has been removed from `todo`.**
