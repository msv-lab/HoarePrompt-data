The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable, meaning it does not affect the state of the loop or the program. The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`. Therefore, the state of `done`, `todo`, `extra`, and `ans` does not need to be adjusted based on the loop head.

However, since the loop runs for a specified number of iterations, the number of iterations left to run is what dictates whether the loop will execute again. Since the loop head does not involve any of the variables `done`, `todo`, `extra`, or `ans`, we do not modify these variables.

State: **`done` contains elements moved from `todo` and back, `todo` contains elements moved from `done` and `extra`, `extra` contains elements not in `todo` and not moved to `done`, `ans` is the count of times `len(done) >= k`**
