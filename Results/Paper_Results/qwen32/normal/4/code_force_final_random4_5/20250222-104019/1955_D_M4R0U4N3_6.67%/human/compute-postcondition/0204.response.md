The code `extra.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the list `extra`. Given that `old` is defined as `a[r - m]`, the element at index `r - m` in the list `a` is removed from `extra`.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 1`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `extra` has the element `a[r - m]` removed from it.**

In natural language: The variable `r` remains `r + 1`, `old` remains `a[r - m]`, and the list `extra` has the element `a[r - m]` removed from it.
