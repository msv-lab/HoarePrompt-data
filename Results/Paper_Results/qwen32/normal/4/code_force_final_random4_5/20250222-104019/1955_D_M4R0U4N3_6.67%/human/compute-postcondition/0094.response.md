Postcondition: **`done`, `todo`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are defined as per the initial conditions, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `a[j]` was in `todo`, then `done` includes the element `a[j]` and `todo` is missing the element `a[j]`. Otherwise, `done`, `todo`, and `extra` all include `a[j]`.**
