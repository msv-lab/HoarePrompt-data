The code snippet `done.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `done`.

Given the initial state, `a[r]` is not in `todo`. After adding `a[r]` to `done`, if `a[r]` was not already in `done`, the set `done` will now include `a[r]`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `old`, or `todo`, except for potentially changing `done` and `extra` as described.

If `a[r]` was not in `extra`, `extra` remains unchanged. If `a[r]` was in `extra`, it would have been added to `done` but not removed from `extra` in the provided initial state description. However, since the code snippet only adds `a[r]` to `done` and does not affect `extra` directly, we assume `extra` remains as described unless `a[r]` was in `extra` and needed to be removed, which is not indicated in the given operations.

The condition for `ans` depends on the size of `done`. If adding `a[r]` to `done` makes the number of elements in `done` greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` becomes 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.

Output State: **`done` includes `a[r]`, `extra` includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`, `todo` includes `old` if `old` is in `done`, `n` remains unchanged, `m` is less than `n`, `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `todo` does not include `a[r]`, `ans` is 2 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `r` is `m + 1`.**
