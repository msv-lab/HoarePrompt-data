Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is 1, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was initially in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not initially in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is an empty set, and `extra` now also contains `a[j]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `extra` has been updated to include `a[j]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
