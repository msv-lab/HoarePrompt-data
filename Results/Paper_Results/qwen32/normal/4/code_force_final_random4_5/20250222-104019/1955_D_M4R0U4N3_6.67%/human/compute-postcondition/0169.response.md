Output State: **`done` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` and processed; `todo` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` but not processed; `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo`; `ans` is 1 if `len(done) >= k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.**

Natural language: The variables `done`, `todo`, and `extra` remain unchanged. The variable `ans` is set to 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` is set to 0.
