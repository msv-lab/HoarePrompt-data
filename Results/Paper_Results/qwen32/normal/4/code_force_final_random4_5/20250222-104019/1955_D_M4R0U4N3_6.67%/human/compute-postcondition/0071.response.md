To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the context and the state of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`done`**: This list contains elements that have been moved from `todo` and back.
2. **`todo`**: This list contains elements that have been moved from `done` and `extra`.
3. **`extra`**: This list contains elements that are not in `todo` and have not been moved to `done`.
4. **`ans`**: This variable holds the count of times the condition `len(done) >= k` has been true during the execution of the program.

### Analysis:
- The variable `ans` is incremented each time the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- Since the exact state of `done`, `todo`, and `extra` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`.
- However, we can describe `ans` as the count of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the execution of the program.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the count of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k`)**
