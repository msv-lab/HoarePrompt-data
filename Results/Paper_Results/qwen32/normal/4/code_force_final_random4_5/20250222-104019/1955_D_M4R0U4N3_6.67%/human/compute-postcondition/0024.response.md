Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input with all elements that were in `a` and `todo` removed, `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were initially in `todo`, and `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is determined based on the length of the set `done`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
