Output State: **`done` is an empty set, `todo` is a set of integers from the input excluding `a[j]`, `extra` is an empty set, `ans` is the count of times `len(done) >= k`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `j` is defined and `a[j]` is no longer in `todo`.**

In natural language: The element `a[j]` has been removed from the set `todo`. All other variables remain unchanged, including the sets `done` and `extra`, the count `ans`, the integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list `a`. The variable `j` is still defined, but `a[j]` is no longer part of the `todo` set.
