Output State: **`done` contains `a[j]`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are defined as per the initial conditions; `j` is `j + 1`; `todo` no longer contains the element `a[j]`.**

Explanation: The element `a[j]` has been added to the set `done`. All other variables retain their initial states as described, with `j` still being incremented by 1 and `todo` no longer containing `a[j]`.
