The code snippet `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the list `todo`. Given the initial state, we know that `r` is `r + 2` and `old` is `a[r - m]`. The element `a[r]` is removed from `todo`, and the state of `extra` and `done` remains unchanged unless `a[r]` was in `done` or `extra`, which is not directly specified in the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`. The element `a[r]` has been removed from `todo`.**
