The code snippet `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element at index `j` of the list `a` to the set `extra`. Given that `j` is 2, the element `a[2]` will be added to the set `extra`.

Let's break down the initial state and the impact of the code snippet:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This value is not affected by the code snippet.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input. These values are not affected by the code snippet.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input. This list is not modified by the code snippet.
- `j` is 2. This value is not affected by the code snippet.
- `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, possibly with `a[1]` removed. This set is not affected by the code snippet.
- `done` is a set containing `a[0]` and possibly `a[1]` if `a[0]` was initially in `todo`. This set is not affected by the code snippet.
- `extra` is a set that initially contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo` initially, otherwise it is an empty set. Additionally, if `a[1]` was not in `todo` initially, it is also in `extra`. After executing `extra.add(a[j])`, the set `extra` will now include `a[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is 2, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input with `a[1]` removed if it was present, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[1]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is a set containing `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `done` is a set containing `a[0]`, and `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo` initially, otherwise it is an empty set, and `extra` now also contains `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not in `todo` initially, and `extra` now also contains `a[2]`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `t` remains the same, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same, `a` remains the same, `j` remains 2, `todo` remains the same with `a[1]` removed if it was present, `done` remains the same, and `extra` now includes `a[2]` in addition to its previous contents.
