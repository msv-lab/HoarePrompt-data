The code provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. This operation does not affect the variables `done`, `todo`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, or `k`.

Output State: **`done` contains elements processed and in `done` after all iterations; `todo` contains elements moved from `done` to `todo`; `extra` contains elements not originally in `todo` and not moved to `done`; `ans` reflects the number of times `len(done) >= k`; `n` is the first input integer; `m` is the second input integer; `k` is the third input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
