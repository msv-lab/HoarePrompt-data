Output State: **`r` is `r + 1` and `old` is `a[(r + 1) - m]`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` was not in `todo`, `extra` includes `a[r]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was not in `extra` and it is in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, there is no change to `done` or `todo`. `ans` is incremented by 1.** 

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` is increased by 1. The other variables (`r`, `old`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, and `a`) retain their previous relationships and conditions as described.
