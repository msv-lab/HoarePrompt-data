Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program's logic is based on the assumption that if `m` is less than either `a` or `b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is `2`. However, this is not necessarily true. The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then determining the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time within one LCM period.

The given program calculates `m // a + m // b + 2` when `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, which is also incorrect. The correct formula involves finding the number of fireworks launched by each installation within one LCM period and then determining the overlap.

Let's correct the logic:

1. Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation within one LCM period.
3. Determine the overlap of fireworks from both installations within one LCM period.
4. The maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time is the sum of fireworks from both installations minus the overlap.

Given the complexity of the problem, the correct implementation involves more sophisticated calculations than those provided in the given program.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
