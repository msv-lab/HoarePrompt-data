The `print(2)` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `a`, `b`, `m`, `t`, or `i`. The integer `2` is explicitly provided as the argument to the `print` function.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes several variables (`a`, `b`, `m`, `t`, and `i`) but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print(2)`, which means it will output the integer `2` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
