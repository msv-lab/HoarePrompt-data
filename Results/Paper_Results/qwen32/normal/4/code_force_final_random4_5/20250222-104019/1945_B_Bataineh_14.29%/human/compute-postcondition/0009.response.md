The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state mentioned includes `a`, `b`, and `m` as integers read from the input, which means these values are already set before the code snippet executes. The code snippet does not change the values of `t` or `i` as they are not mentioned in the code. Therefore, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are set to the integers provided by the input, while `t` remains greater than 0, and `i` is still incremented by 1.
