The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the keys in the `hmp` (Counter object). To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to identify the next key in `hmp` after the current one.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is 19
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`
- `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`
- `i` is the next key in `hmp` after the current one

Since `i` is the next key in `hmp` after the current one, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the subsequent key in the iteration order of `hmp`.

State: **`t` is 19, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `i` is the next key in `hmp` after the current one**.

To be more precise, if we denote the current key as `i_current`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the key that comes after `i_current` in the iteration order of `hmp`.

However, since we do not have the specific keys in `hmp` or the current key `i_current`, we can only express the state in terms of `i` being the next key.

State: **`t` is 19, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `i` is the next key in `hmp` after the current one**.
