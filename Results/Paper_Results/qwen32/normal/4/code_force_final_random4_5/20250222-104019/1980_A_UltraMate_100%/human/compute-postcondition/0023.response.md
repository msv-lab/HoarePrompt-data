To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
ans += m - hmp[i]
```

Given:
- `ans` is initially `m` multiplied by the number of characters in `p` ('ABCDEFG') that are not in `hmp`. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.
- `hmp` must contain at least one item.
- `i` is `next_key` where `next_key` is the next key in `hmp`.

The code snippet increments `ans` by the value `m - hmp[i]`.

Let's break down the changes:
- The value of `ans` is updated to its current value plus `m - hmp[i]`.

Since `i` is `next_key` and `hmp` contains at least one item, we can assume `i` is a valid key in `hmp`. The exact value of `hmp[i]` is not specified, but we can denote it as `hmp[i]`.

The new value of `ans` will be:
- `ans` = `ans` + (`m - hmp[i]`)

Thus, the updated `ans` will be the old `ans` plus the difference between `m` and the value of `hmp[i]`.

Output State: **`ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`, `hmp` must contain at least one item, `i` is `next_key` where `next_key` is the next key in `hmp`.**
