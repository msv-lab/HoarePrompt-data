Output State: **`t` is 18, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `s` is the new string from the input, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object with the character counts of `s`, `i` is `'G'`, `ans` is `ans + m`.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` is increased by the value of `m`. All other variables retain their initial values.
