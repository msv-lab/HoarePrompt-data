The code snippet `ans += m - hmp[i]` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the result of `m - hmp[i]` to it. Given that `ans` was initially `3 * m`, the new value of `ans` will be `3 * m + m - hmp[i]`, which simplifies to `4 * m - hmp[i]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `hmp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 19, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is `4 * m - hmp[i]`, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, and the frequency of the character `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`.**
