The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `m`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `ans`, we can only describe the change in `ans` in terms of `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 19, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `s` is the string from the input, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `i` is `'G'`, `ans` is `ans` + `m`.**
