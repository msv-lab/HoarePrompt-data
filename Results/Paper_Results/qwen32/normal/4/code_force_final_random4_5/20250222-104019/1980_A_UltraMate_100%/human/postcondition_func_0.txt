The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of length `n` with characters from 'A' to 'G', and two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of additions needed to ensure each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string.
