Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` (1 <= n <= 50) and `m` (1 <= m <= 5), and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
