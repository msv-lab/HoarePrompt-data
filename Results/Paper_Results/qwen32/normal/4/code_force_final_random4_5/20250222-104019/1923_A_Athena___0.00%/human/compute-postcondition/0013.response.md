The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given the initial state, the last element of `a` is `0`, so this element will be removed. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is the newly input integer, `a` is a list of integers (excluding the trailing 0), `res` is 0**.
