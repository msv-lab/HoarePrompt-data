The code snippet `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Given that `a` initially starts with `0` as its only element, after executing this line, `a` will become an empty list.

Here are the updated values of the variables:
- `t` remains an input integer within the range 2 to 1000.
- `n` remains a newly input integer.
- `a` becomes an empty list.
- `res` remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 2 to 1000, `n` is a newly input integer, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 0**.
