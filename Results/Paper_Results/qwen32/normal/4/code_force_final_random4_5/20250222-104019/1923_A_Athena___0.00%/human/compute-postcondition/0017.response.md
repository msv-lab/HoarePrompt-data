The code snippet `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the last element is specified to be 0, this element will be removed. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `res` remains 0. The list `a` will have one less element after the operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is the newly input integer, `a` is a list of integers (with the last 0 removed), `res` is 0.**
