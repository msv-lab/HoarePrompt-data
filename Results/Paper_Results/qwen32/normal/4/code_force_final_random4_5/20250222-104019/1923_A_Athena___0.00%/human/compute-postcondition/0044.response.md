The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the initial state of `a` is `[0]`, after executing `a.pop()`, the list `a` will be empty.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 999, `n` is a newly input integer, `a` is [], `res` is 0**.
