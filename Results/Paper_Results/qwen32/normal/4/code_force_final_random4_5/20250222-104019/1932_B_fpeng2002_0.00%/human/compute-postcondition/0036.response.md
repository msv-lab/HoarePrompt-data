The only variables in the loop head are `x` and the range `len(nums)`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x` and the length of `nums`. If `x` is less than `len(nums)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `len(nums)` must be at least 2.

State: **`start_year` is `((nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`, `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `x` is 2**
