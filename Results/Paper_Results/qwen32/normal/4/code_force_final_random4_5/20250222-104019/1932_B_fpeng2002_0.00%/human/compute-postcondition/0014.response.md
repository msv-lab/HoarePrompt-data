The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `num_tests` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0 again.

State: **`start_year` is the value computed after processing all elements in the `nums` list according to the given formula, `num_tests` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers, and `x` is the last index of the `nums` list.**
