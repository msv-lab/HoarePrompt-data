You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine if the code is correct.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign occurs every `a_i` years and must occur sequentially. This means if the i-th sign occurs in year `x`, the (i+1)-th sign must occur in a year `y` where `y > x` and `y` is a multiple of `a_(i+1)`.

### Code Analysis
The provided code follows a specific approach to solve this:

1. It reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`).
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and their respective periodicities (`nums`).
3. It initializes `start_year` to 0.
4. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by:
   - Adding 1 to `start_year` to ensure we are looking for the next occurrence.
   - Dividing by the current sign's periodicity (`nums[x]`), and then adding 1 to find the next multiple.
   - Multiplying by the current sign's periodicity to get the exact year.
5. It prints the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

### Correctness Analysis
Let's consider the logic in the loop that calculates the `start_year`:
```python
start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
```
This line essentially finds the smallest year greater than `start_year` that is a multiple of `nums[x]`. Here's a step-by-step explanation:
- `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]` gives the integer division of `start_year + 1` by `nums[x]`, which is the largest multiple of `nums[x]` that is less than or equal to `start_year + 1`.
- Adding 1 to the result ensures we are looking for the next multiple.
- Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives us the exact year.

This logic correctly ensures that we find the next occurrence year for each sign sequentially.

### Example Walkthrough
For the first test case in the example:
- `n = 6`
- `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
- Iteration 1: `start_year = 0`, next occurrence of 3 is `3`.
- Iteration 2: `start_year = 3`, next occurrence of 2 after 3 is `4`.
- Iteration 3: `start_year = 4`, next occurrence of 4 after 4 is `8`.
- Iteration 4: `start_year = 8`, next occurrence of 5 after 8 is `10`.
- Iteration 5: `start_year = 10`, next occurrence of 9 after 10 is `18`.
- Iteration 6: `start_year = 18`, next occurrence of 18 after 18 is `36`.

The code correctly calculates the year for the n-th sign to occur as `36`.

### Conclusion
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs sequentially according to its periodicity.
