You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of signs and their respective periodicities. For each test case, it calculates and prints the earliest common year in which all signs will be synchronized based on their periodicities.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
The Chaya tribe believes that there are `n` signs of the apocalypse. Each sign `i` occurs every `a_i` years. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign can only occur after the previous one has occurred. The task is to determine the year in which the `n`-th sign will occur.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_i`. It then calculates the year in which the `n`-th sign will occur by iterating through each sign and updating the `start_year` accordingly.

Here's the program for reference:
```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

### Correctness Check:
Let's walk through the logic of the program to see if it correctly calculates the year for each sign to occur sequentially.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `start_year` is initialized to 0, which means the counting starts from year 0.

2. **Loop through each sign**:
   - For each sign `i` (from 0 to `n-1`), the program calculates the next occurrence of the sign.
   - The formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` determines the next year that is a multiple of `nums[x]` and is strictly greater than `start_year`.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples.

#### Example 1:
Input:
```
4
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 1 1 1 1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```

Output:
```
36
5
5
2012
```

- **First Test Case**:
  - Sign 1: Occurs at year 3 (3 * 1)
  - Sign 2: Occurs at year 4 (2 * 2)
  - Sign 3: Occurs at year 8 (4 + 4)
  - Sign 4: Occurs at year 10 (8 + 2)
  - Sign 5: Occurs at year 18 (10 + 8)
  - Sign 6: Occurs at year 36 (18 + 18)

- **Second Test Case**:
  - Sign 1: Occurs at year 1 (1 * 1)
  - Sign 2: Occurs at year 2 (1 + 1)
  - Sign 3: Occurs at year 3 (2 + 1)
  - Sign 4: Occurs at year 4 (3 + 1)
  - Sign 5: Occurs at year 5 (4 + 1)

- **Third Test Case**:
  - All signs occur every year, so the 5th sign occurs at year 5.

- **Fourth Test Case**:
  - Sign 1: Occurs at year 50 (50 * 1)
  - Sign 2: Occurs at year 60 (50 + 10)
  - Sign 3: Occurs at year 711 (60 + 651)
  - Sign 4: Occurs at year 911 (711 + 200)
  - Sign 5: Occurs at year 1414 (911 + 503)
  - Sign 6: Occurs at year 2012 (1414 + 606)

The program seems to correctly calculate the year for each sign to occur sequentially based on the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and verifying it with the examples provided, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. There are no apparent edge cases that the program fails to handle based on the given examples.

Correctness: **True**.
