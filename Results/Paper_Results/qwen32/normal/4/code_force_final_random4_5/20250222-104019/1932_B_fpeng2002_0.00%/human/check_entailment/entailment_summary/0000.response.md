Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, based on the sequential occurrence of signs with given periodicities. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. For each test case, the program reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
2. It initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year from which we start waiting for the first sign.
3. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by:
   - Adding 1 to `start_year` to ensure we are looking for the next occurrence strictly after the current `start_year`.
   - Dividing by the periodicity `nums[x]` to find how many full cycles have passed up to `start_year`.
   - Adding 1 to the result to move to the next cycle.
   - Multiplying back by `nums[x]` to get the actual year of the next occurrence.
4. The program updates `start_year` to this calculated year and repeats the process for the next sign.
5. Finally, it prints the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

The logic correctly implements the requirement of waiting for each sign to occur strictly after the previous one, and it calculates the correct year for each test case based on the provided examples. The program handles multiple test cases as well.

Correctness: **True**
