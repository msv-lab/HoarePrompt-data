The code updates the value of `start_year` based on its current value and the value at index `x` in the `nums` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `start_year` is calculated as `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

Given that `x` is 2, the new `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`.

Output State: **`start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`, `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `x` is 2**.
