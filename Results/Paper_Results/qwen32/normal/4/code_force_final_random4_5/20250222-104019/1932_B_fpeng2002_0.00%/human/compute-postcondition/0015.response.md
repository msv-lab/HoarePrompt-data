The code snippet `num_tests -= 1` decrements the value of `num_tests` by 1. The other variables (`start_year`, `n`, `nums`, and `x`) are not affected by this operation.

Given that `num_tests` must be greater than 0 before this operation, after the decrement, `num_tests` will still be a positive integer (as long as it was greater than 1 initially). If `num_tests` was exactly 1 before this operation, it will now be 0, but the precondition that `num_tests` must be greater than 0 would no longer hold in that case.

Output State: **`start_year` is the value computed after processing all elements in the `nums` list according to the given formula, `num_tests` is a positive integer less than its previous value, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers, and `x` is the last index of the `nums` list.**
