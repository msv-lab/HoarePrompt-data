Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify the pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. The program has several logical issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1` for Finding Maximum XOR:**
   - The program uses `func_1` to compare bitwise OR operations, but it does not correctly translate these comparisons into finding the maximum XOR. The XOR operation is fundamentally different from the OR operation, and the logic for maximizing XOR is not correctly implemented.
   - The program attempts to find the maximum value in the permutation using bitwise OR comparisons, but this does not guarantee that the XOR of the two maximum values will be the maximum possible XOR.

2. **Handling Multiple Indices with the Same OR Value:**
   - The program collects multiple indices that have the same OR value with `ans1` but does not correctly handle these indices to find the maximum XOR. The logic for comparing these indices and determining the maximum XOR is flawed.

3. **Incorrect Assumption about Maximum XOR:**
   - The program assumes that the maximum XOR can be found by comparing the maximum value in the permutation with other values. This is incorrect because the maximum XOR can occur between any two values, not necessarily the maximum value.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to use a strategy that directly compares XOR values between pairs of indices, possibly using a divide-and-conquer approach or other methods to efficiently find the maximum XOR with the given constraints. The current implementation does not follow this approach and thus is incorrect.
