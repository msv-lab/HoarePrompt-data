Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in its approach to finding the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\). Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Finding `ans1`:**
   - The program correctly identifies the index `ans1` such that \(p_{ans1}\) is one of the largest values in the permutation by comparing \(p_{ans1} \mid p_{ans1}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) for all \(i\). Since \(p_i \mid p_i = p_i\), this essentially finds the maximum value in the permutation.

2. **Finding `mx` and `v`:**
   - The program then tries to find the indices where the value is equal to the maximum value (`mx`). However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple indices have the same maximum value. The list `v` is supposed to contain all indices \(i\) such that \(p_i = p_{mx}\), but the program incorrectly resets `v` every time it finds a new maximum (`mx`), which means only the last index with the maximum value will be considered.

3. **Final Comparison:**
   - The program then tries to find the index `ans` within the list `v` that maximizes \(p_i \oplus p_{ans1}\). However, since `v` only contains one index (the last one with the maximum value), this comparison is unnecessary and incorrect because it does not consider other indices that could potentially have a higher XOR value with `ans1`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

- Identify the maximum value in the permutation.
- Collect all indices that have this maximum value.
- Compare these indices with `ans1` to find the pair that maximizes the XOR value.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(a, b, c, d):
    print('?', a, b, c, d, flush=True)
    return input()

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ans1 = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        x = func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)
        if x == '<':
            ans1 = i
    
    mx = 0
    v = []
    for i in range(n):
        x = func_1(mx, ans1, i, ans1)
        if x == '<':
            v = [i]
            mx = i
        elif x == '=':
            v.append(i)
    
    ans = v[0]
    for i in range(1, len(v)):
        x = func_1(ans, ans1, v[i], ans1)
        if x == '<':
            ans = v[i]
    
    print('!', ans, ans1, flush=True)
```

This version correctly collects all indices with the maximum value and compares them to find the pair that maximizes the XOR value.
