Postcondition: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)` (one less than before), `tp1` is 1 if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, otherwise `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, otherwise `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is `ans + diff1` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, otherwise `ans` is `ans + diff2`, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `item` is the tuple `(-difference, i, index)` that was the smallest in `max_heap`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, and `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`.**
