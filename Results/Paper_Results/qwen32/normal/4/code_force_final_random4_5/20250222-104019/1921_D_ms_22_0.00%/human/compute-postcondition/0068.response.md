Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, and `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with at least one tuple remaining, except one tuple has been removed. The variable `ans` has been increased by either `diff1` or `diff` depending on the condition. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is calculated as `abs(item[1] - b[tp1 - 1])` if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`. `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1 > diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is updated by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is updated by `diff2`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is updated by `diff`. The variable `item` is assigned the value of the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`.**
