The code snippet adds a new element to the `max_heap` using `heapq.heappush`. The new element is `(-diff1, i, 0)`. This means that the `max_heap` will now contain an additional tuple with the negative of `diff1`, the value of `i`, and 0 as its third element.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains either `[(-diff1, i, 0)]` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, or `[(-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1), (-diff1, i, 0)]` if `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`; `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. `i` is the next element in the list `a`. `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`. `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.**
