Postcondition: **`max_heap` contains tuples in the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, except for the one that was popped; `ans` is `ans + item[0]`, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is updated to 1 and `tp2` remains `m - 1`. Otherwise, `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is updated to `m - 2`. Additionally, `item[2]` is greater than or equal to `tp1` and less than or equal to `tp2 + 1`.**
