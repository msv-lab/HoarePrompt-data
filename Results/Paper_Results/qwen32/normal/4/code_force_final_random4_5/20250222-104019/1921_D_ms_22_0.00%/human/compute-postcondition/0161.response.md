Postcondition: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)` after the smallest element has been removed; `item` is the removed tuple `(-difference, i, index)` with the largest `difference`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])` and `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `difference`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp2`, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `difference`.**
