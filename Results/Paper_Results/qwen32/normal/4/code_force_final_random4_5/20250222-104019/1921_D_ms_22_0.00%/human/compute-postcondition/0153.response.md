Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)` after the smallest element has been removed; `item` is the removed tuple `(-difference, i, index)` with the largest `difference`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`; `tp1` is incremented by 1; `ans` is increased by `diff1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` has been increased by `diff1`, which is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`. All other variables retain their previous states.
