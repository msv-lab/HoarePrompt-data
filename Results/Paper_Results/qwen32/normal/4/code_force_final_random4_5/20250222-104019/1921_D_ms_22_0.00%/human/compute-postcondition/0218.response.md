Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple in the form `(-diff, i, index)` after removing the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value that was removed from `max_heap`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`.**

In natural language: The `max_heap` still contains at least one tuple in the form `(-diff, i, index)` after the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value has been removed. The variable `t` is still greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`. The variables `n` and `m` are unchanged, still representing the two integers read from the input. The list `a` of integers read from the input remains unchanged, and the sorted list `b` of integers read from the input also remains unchanged. The variable `item` still holds the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value that was removed from `max_heap`. The variable `diff1` is still `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`. The new variable `diff2` has been assigned the value `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`.
