Postcondition: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)` after the smallest element has been removed; `item` is the removed tuple `(-difference, i, index)` with the largest `difference`; `ans` is increased by `difference`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.**
