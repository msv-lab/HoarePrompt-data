The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the next element in list `a` (denoted by `i`) and the first element of the sorted list `b`. This value is stored in the variable `diff1`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the next element in `a`, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` and `m` remain input integers, `a` remains a list of integers, `b` remains a sorted list of integers, `tp1` remains 0, `tp2` remains `m - 1`, `ans` remains 0, `i` remains the next element in `a`, and `diff1` is calculated as the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`.
