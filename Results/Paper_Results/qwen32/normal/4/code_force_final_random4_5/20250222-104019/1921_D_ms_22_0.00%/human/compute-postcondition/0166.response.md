The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. Other variables such as `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, and `t` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `tp1` and `tp2` have moved towards each other, `ans` contains the sum of the differences, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input.**
