### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by maximizing the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) between two arrays \( a \) and \( c \) where \( c \) is constructed from the array \( b \) by selecting \( n \) integers from \( b \).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach used in the program:

1. **Sorting Array \( b \)**:
   - The array \( b \) is sorted. This allows us to efficiently access the smallest and largest elements in \( b \) which are potential candidates to maximize the difference \( |a_i - c_i| \).

2. **Max Heap Initialization**:
   - A max heap (priority queue) is used to keep track of the maximum possible differences for each element in \( a \). The heap stores tuples of the form \((-diff, a_i, index)\), where \( -diff \) is the negative of the difference, \( a_i \) is the element from \( a \), and \( index \) is the index in \( b \) that gives the maximum difference.

3. **Heap Population**:
   - For each element \( a_i \) in \( a \), the program calculates the differences between \( a_i \) and the smallest element \( b[0] \) and the largest element \( b[m-1] \) in the sorted \( b \).
   - The larger of these differences is pushed onto the heap with its corresponding \( a_i \) and the index in \( b \).

4. **Maximizing the Difference**:
   - The program then repeatedly pops the largest difference from the heap (which is the smallest negative value, hence the negative sign).
   - It checks if the index associated with this difference is still valid (i.e., it hasn't been used up yet by previous selections).
   - If valid, it adds the difference to the total sum and updates the pointer (`tp1` or `tp2`) to mark the element in \( b \) as used.
   - If not valid, it recalculates the differences using the next smallest or largest available element in \( b \) and adds the new difference to the total sum.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in \( a \) for a given test case, the total difference \( D \) is printed.

### Analysis:

The approach ensures that for each element in \( a \), we consider the two extreme elements in \( b \) (the smallest and largest) to maximize the difference. By using a heap, the program efficiently tracks and selects the maximum possible differences, ensuring that the total difference \( D \) is maximized.

The provided program correctly implements this approach, and the annotated states match the expected behavior of the program. The logic for handling multiple test cases, sorting, heap operations, and difference calculations is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
