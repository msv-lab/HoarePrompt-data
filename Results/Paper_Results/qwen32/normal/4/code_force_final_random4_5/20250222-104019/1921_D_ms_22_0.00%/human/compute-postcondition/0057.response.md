Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, and `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with at least one tuple remaining. The tuple `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, j)` that was removed from `max_heap`. `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1 - 1])`. `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. `tp1` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the variable `tp1` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
