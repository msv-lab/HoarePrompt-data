Output State: **`max_heap` contains tuples in the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, except for the one that was popped; `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is `ans + item[0]`, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was popped from `max_heap`. Additionally, `item[2]` is greater than or equal to `tp1` and `item[2]` is less than or equal to `tp2 + 1`, and `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `tp2` has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
