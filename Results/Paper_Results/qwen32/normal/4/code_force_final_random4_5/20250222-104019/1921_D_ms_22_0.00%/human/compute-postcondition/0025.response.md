Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. `max_heap` contains either `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2` or not. `i` is the next element in `a` after the current one.**
