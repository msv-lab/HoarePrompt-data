Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99; `n` and `m` are input integers; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each split substring to an integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting a new input string, converting each split substring to an integer, and sorting the resulting list in ascending order; `max_heap` is an empty list; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
    diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
    if diff1 > diff2:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
    else:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `max_heap` contains one tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains one tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. `max_heap` contains either `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2` or not. `i` is the next element in `a` after the current one.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the next element in `a`, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
