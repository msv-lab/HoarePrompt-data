Postcondition: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)`; `item` is the tuple `(-difference, i, index)` that was the smallest in the heap, which corresponds to the largest `difference` value; `ans` is increased by `difference`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.**
