Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `diff1` is greater than `diff2`.**

Explanation: The `max_heap` list now contains one tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`, which was pushed onto the heap using the `heapq.heappush` function. All other variables retain their initial values.
