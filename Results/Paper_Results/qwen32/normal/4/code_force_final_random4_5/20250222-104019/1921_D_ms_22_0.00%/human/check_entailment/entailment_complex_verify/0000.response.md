### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the annotated version and the problem description.

#### Program Steps Breakdown

1. **Input Reading and Sorting**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It sorts the array `b`.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - It initializes an empty max heap.
   - For each element in `a`, it calculates the absolute difference with the smallest (`b[0]`) and largest (`b[m-1]`) elements in `b`.
   - It pushes the larger of these differences (negated to simulate a max heap) along with the element and the corresponding index (`0` or `m-1`) into the heap.

3. **Heap Processing**:
   - It repeatedly pops the largest difference from the heap.
   - It checks if the index associated with the popped element is within the current bounds (`tp1` to `tp2`).
   - If not, it recalculates the differences with the current smallest and largest elements in `b` and updates the pointers `tp1` and `tp2`.
   - It adds the actual difference to `ans`.
   - It updates the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` based on which element was used.

4. **Output**:
   - It prints the accumulated sum `ans` for each test case.

#### Validation Using Annotated Code

- **State Before Function Call**:
  - The input is correctly read and parsed.
  - Arrays `a` and `b` are within the specified constraints.
  - `b` is sorted.

- **State During Heap Initialization**:
  - For each element in `a`, the differences with the smallest and largest elements in `b` are calculated.
  - The larger difference is pushed into the heap, ensuring that the largest potential differences are considered first.

- **State During Heap Processing**:
  - The heap ensures that the largest differences are processed first.
  - The pointers `tp1` and `tp2` track the current smallest and largest elements in `b` that have not been used yet.
  - The program recalculates differences if the index of the popped element is out of bounds, ensuring that the most optimal choices are always made.

- **State After Processing**:
  - The heap is empty, and `ans` contains the maximum total difference for the current test case.
  - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Final Evaluation

The program correctly handles all the provided examples and edge cases. It consistently produces the expected output by using a max heap to always choose the largest possible difference for each element in `a` and adjusting the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` accordingly.

**Final: **True**
