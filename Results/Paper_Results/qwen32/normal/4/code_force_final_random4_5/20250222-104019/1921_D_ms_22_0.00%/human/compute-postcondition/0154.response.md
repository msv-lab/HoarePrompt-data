Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)` after the smallest element has been removed; `item` is the removed tuple `(-difference, i, index)` with the largest `difference`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`; `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `tp2` has been decremented by 1. All other variables (`max_heap`, `item`, `diff1`, and `diff2`) remain unchanged.
