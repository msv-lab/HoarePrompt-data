Output State: **`max_heap` contains either `[(-diff1, i, 0)]` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, or `[(-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1)]` if `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. `i` is the next element in the list `a`. `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`.**

In simple terms, the value of `diff1` has been updated to the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
