The code snippet `ans += diff2` increments the variable `ans` by the value of `diff2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)` (one less than before), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is `ans + diff2`, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `item` is the tuple `(-difference, i, index)` that was the smallest in `max_heap`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`**.
