The code snippet pushes a new element `(-diff1, i, 0)` into the `max_heap`. This means that the heap will now contain an additional tuple with these values.

Given the initial state, `max_heap` originally contains `[(-diff1, i, 0)]` and `[(-diff2, i, m - 1)]` if `diff1` is not equal to `diff2`, or it contains two identical tuples `[(-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1), (-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1)]` if `diff1` is equal to `diff2`.

After executing the `heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))`, the `max_heap` will have an additional element `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Therefore, if `diff1` was not equal to `diff2`, the heap will now have three elements: `[(-diff1, i, 0), (-diff2, i, m - 1), (-diff1, i, 0)]`. If `diff1` was equal to `diff2`, the heap will now have four elements: `[(-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1), (-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1), (-diff1, i, 0), (-diff1, i, 0)]`.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains `[(-diff1, i, 0), (-diff2, i, m - 1), (-diff1, i, 0)]` if `diff1` is not equal to `diff2`, or `[(-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1), (-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1), (-diff1, i, 0), (-diff1, i, 0)]` if `diff1` is equal to `diff2`; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `i` is `a[next_index]`; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`; `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.**
