The `while` loop in the provided code snippet will continue to execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `max_heap` still contains at least one tuple.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple in the form `(-diff, i, index)` after removing the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value. Therefore, to proceed with the next iteration, we need to ensure that `max_heap` is not empty after the removal of the tuple.

Since the loop condition is simply `while max_heap:`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `max_heap` still has at least one tuple after the current iteration's removal.

Thus, we need to add a tuple back to `max_heap` to ensure it is not empty.

State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple in the form `(-diff, i, index)` after removing the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value and then adding back one tuple, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value that was removed from `max_heap`. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1 > diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is updated by adding the positive value of `item[0]` to it. If `item[2] == tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1.**
