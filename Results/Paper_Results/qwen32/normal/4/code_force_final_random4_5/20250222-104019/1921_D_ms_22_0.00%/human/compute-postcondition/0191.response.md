The code snippet adds a new element to the `max_heap` using `heapq.heappush`. The new element is `(-diff1, i, 0)`. This change affects the `max_heap` by adding this new tuple to it. No other variables are modified by this operation.

Output State: **`max_heap` is not empty and contains either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`, along with the new element `(-diff1, i, 0)`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `i` is `i_next_next`.**
