To determine what will be printed by the given `print(i)` statement, let's analyze the initial state provided:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. The value of `t` is not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement.
2. **`n`**: An integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 0. The value of `n` is also not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement.
3. **`arr`**: A list of integers obtained from the input. The exact integers in this list are not specified.
4. **`mpp`**: A `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`. This means `mpp` is a dictionary-like object where keys are elements from `arr` and values are the counts of those elements.
5. **`first`**: A boolean variable set to `True`. The value of `first` is not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement.
6. **`i`**: A key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1. This means `i` is an element from `arr` that appears exactly once in the list.

Given the information above, the `print(i)` statement will output a value that is an element from the list `arr` and this element appears exactly once in `arr`.

Since the exact elements of `arr` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific numerical value of `i`. However, we can describe the value of `i` precisely based on the given information.

Output: **i (where i is an element from the list `arr` that appears exactly once)**
