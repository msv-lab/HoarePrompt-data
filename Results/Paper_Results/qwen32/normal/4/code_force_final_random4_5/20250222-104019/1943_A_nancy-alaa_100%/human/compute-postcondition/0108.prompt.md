Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mpp = Counter(arr)
    first = False
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i not in mpp.keys():
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1:
            first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is `True` if there is at least one element in `arr` with a frequency of 1, otherwise `False`; `i` is `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is True if an `i` with `mpp[i] == 1` is found before `i` is not a key in `mpp`; `i` is the value that causes the loop to break.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop breaks when `i` is not in `mpp` or `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
