The `break` statement in the provided code snippet will terminate the most internal loop or if statement it is placed within. However, since there is no loop or if statement shown in the code snippet, the `break` statement will not have any effect on the variables `n` or `i` or the dictionary `mpp`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, and `mpp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 0, and `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`.**
