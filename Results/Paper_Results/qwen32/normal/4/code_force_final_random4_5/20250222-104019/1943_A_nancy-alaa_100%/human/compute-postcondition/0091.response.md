Output State: **`n` must be at least 0, `i` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The value of `n` remains unchanged as it must be at least 0. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1 as per the initial state description. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
