Let's analyze the given Python program and the problem description step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: Determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX of the array `c` after all elements from `a` have been processed.
2. **Players' Actions**:
   - Alice appends an element from `a` to `c` and removes it from `a`.
   - Bob removes an element from `a` without appending it to `c`.
3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
4. **MEX Definition**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.
2. Uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
3. Iterates over the range `[0, n]` to find the smallest integer not in `arr` or the smallest integer that appears exactly once after the first such integer has been encountered.

### Issues in the Program

The provided program does not correctly simulate the game's optimal strategy. Instead, it attempts to find the MEX based on the counts of elements in the initial array `arr`. This approach does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob and their respective strategies to maximize or minimize the MEX.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the game based on the players' strategies:
- Alice will always pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX.
- Bob will always pick the smallest available number to minimize the MEX.

However, a more efficient approach involves:
- Counting the occurrences of each number.
- Iterating through the numbers from 0 upwards to find the smallest number that does not appear an even number of times. This is because Bob will always be able to remove one of the pairs if a number appears an even number of times, and Alice can only add one of the pairs.

### Correctness

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly simulate the game's optimal strategy and does not compute the correct MEX for each test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
