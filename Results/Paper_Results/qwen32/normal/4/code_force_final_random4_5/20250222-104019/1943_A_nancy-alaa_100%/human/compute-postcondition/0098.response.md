The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust those variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the loop statement `for i in range(n + 1):`, we know that `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. From the provided information, we know that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. This means that at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

The variable `n` does not change within the loop based on the given information, so it remains the same.

Let's summarize the state adjustments:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Since the problem does not provide the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` (where `i` is the value at the end of the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be at least 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

To make it more concrete, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`n` must be at least 0, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.
