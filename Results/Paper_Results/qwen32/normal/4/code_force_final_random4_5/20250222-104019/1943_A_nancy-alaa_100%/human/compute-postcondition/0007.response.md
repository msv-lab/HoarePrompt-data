Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.
- `first` is `False`.
- `i` is not a key in `mpp`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

From the initial state, we know that `i` is not a key in the `Counter` object `mpp`. However, the specific value of `i` is not provided. The only information we have is that `i` is some integer that does not appear in the list `arr` (since `i` is not a key in `mpp`).

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `i`. However, based on the given information, we can describe `i` as an integer that is not present in the list `arr`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the value of `i`, which is an unspecified integer not found in `arr`.

Output: **i (where i is an integer not present in arr)**
