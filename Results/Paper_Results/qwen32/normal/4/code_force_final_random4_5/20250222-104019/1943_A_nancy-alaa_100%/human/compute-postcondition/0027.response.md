Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown
1. `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
2. `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
3. `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
4. `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.
5. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
6. If `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `first` remains unchanged.
7. `i` is explicitly set to `n + 1`.

### Code Snippet
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to `n + 1` in the initial state.
- The value of `i` does not change within the provided code snippet.
- The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is `n + 1`.

### Conclusion
The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is `n + 1`.

Output: **n + 1 (where n is the value of n)**
