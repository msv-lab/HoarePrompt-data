### Reasoning:

The program's goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game between Alice and Bob ends, with both playing optimally. According to the problem, Alice aims to maximize the score (MEX), while Bob aims to minimize it.

The strategy the program follows is to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a` using a `Counter`. It then checks for the smallest non-negative integer that is either not present in `a` or appears exactly once. This integer is printed as the MEX for each test case.

Let's analyze the logic:
1. **Counting Occurrences**: The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
2. **Finding MEX**: The program iterates through numbers from `0` to `n` (inclusive) and checks:
   - If a number `i` is not present in the array `a` (`i not in mpp.keys()`), it prints `i` as the MEX and breaks out of the loop.
   - If a number `i` appears exactly once in `a` and it's the first such number found (`mpp[i] == 1`), it prints `i` as the MEX and breaks out of the loop.

This logic is correct because:
- If a number is not present in `a`, it means it is the smallest non-negative integer that can be the MEX.
- If a number appears exactly once, it means that Alice can pick it in her turn, ensuring that the MEX is at least this number, as Bob will not be able to pick it again.

Thus, the program correctly calculates the MEX based on optimal play by both Alice and Bob.
