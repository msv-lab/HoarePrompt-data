Output State: **`n` must be at least 0, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
