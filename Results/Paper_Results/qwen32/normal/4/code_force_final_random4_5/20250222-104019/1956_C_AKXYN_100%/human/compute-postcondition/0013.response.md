Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`.
- `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement contains a formatted string `'1 %d' % i` and a unpacked range `*range(1, n + 1)`.
- `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to consider the context. Since `i` is not defined, it's likely that `i` is a variable used in a loop or some other part of the code not provided here. However, based on the structure of the print statement, we can infer that `i` is expected to be an integer value.
- `*range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and unpacks them into the print statement.

### What Will Be Printed:
- The first part of the print statement `'1 %d' % i` will print the string `'1 '` followed by the value of `i`.
- The second part `*range(1, n + 1)` will print the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we will describe it as `i` (where `i` is an integer).

Output: **1 [i] 1 2 3 ... [n] (where [i] is the value of i and [n] is the value of n)**

To make it more precise and adhering to the format:

Output: **1 [i] 1 2 3 ... [n] (where [i] is the value of i and [n] is the number of rows/columns in the matrix mat)**
