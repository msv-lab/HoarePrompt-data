Let's break down the code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

The given `print` statement is:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

From the initial state, we have:
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 (though `t` is not used in the given snippet)
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n` (though `mat` is not used in the given snippet)
- `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1` (though `res` is not used in the given snippet)
- `i` is 1

Let's analyze the `print` statement:
- `'2 %d' % i` is a string formatting operation where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer, which will be replaced by the value of `i`. Given `i` is 1, `'2 %d' % i` evaluates to `'2 1'`.
- `*range(1, n + 1)` uses the unpacking operator `*` to unpack the elements of the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can describe the output in terms of `n`. The range will generate numbers from 1 to `n`.

Thus, the `print` statement will output the string `'2 1'` followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **2 1 1 2 ... n (where n is greater than 0)**
