To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and analyze the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `res` is 110.
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 (specific value not provided).
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 (specific value not provided).
- `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`.
- `i` is `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(res, n << 1)
```

### Analysis:
- `res` is explicitly given as 110.
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, but its specific value is not provided.
- The expression `n << 1` is a bitwise left shift operation. In Python, `x << y` shifts the bits of `x` to the left by `y` positions, which is equivalent to multiplying `x` by \(2^y\). Here, `y` is 1, so `n << 1` is equivalent to `n * 2`.

### Output Calculation:
- The first part of the print statement is `res`, which is 110.
- The second part of the print statement is `n << 1`, which is `n * 2`. Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only express it in terms of `n`.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the value of `res` (which is 110) followed by the value of `n` multiplied by 2.

Output: **110, n * 2 (where n is a positive integer greater than 0)**
