To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the provided code and the given output states for the first three iterations.

The loop processes each test case individually. For each test case:
1. It reads an integer `n`.
2. It initializes a matrix `mat` of size `n x n` where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`.
3. It calculates `res` as the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
4. It prints `res` and `n << 1` (which is `n` multiplied by 2).
5. It then prints a series of commands for `n` down to 1, each command printing a row of the matrix twice in a specific format.

Given the output states after the first three iterations:
- After the first iteration, the output includes `res` calculated for a specific `n`.
- After the second iteration, the output includes `res` as 110, which corresponds to `n = 5` (since `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to 4, which equals 110).
- After the third iteration, the same `res` value of 110 is printed, indicating another test case with `n = 5`.

This pattern suggests that for each test case, the loop processes the input `n`, calculates `res`, and prints the required outputs.

Since the problem states that the number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 500 and the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 Ã— 10^5, the loop will execute `t` times, each time processing a different `n`.

The final output state after all iterations will be the concatenation of the outputs for each individual test case. Each test case contributes:
- The value of `res` calculated for its specific `n`.
- The value of `n << 1`.
- A series of commands for `n` down to 1, each command printing a row of the matrix twice.

Since the exact values of `n` for each test case are not provided, we can only describe the final output state in terms of the pattern observed.

Output State: **The final output state consists of the concatenated outputs for each of the `t` test cases, where each test case outputs `res` (calculated as the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`), `n << 1`, and a series of commands for `n` down to 1, each command printing a row of the matrix twice.**

In simpler terms, the final output is a series of results for each test case, with each result including the calculated `res`, `n * 2`, and the specified row commands.
