Let's break down the provided print statement and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

The print statement is:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`**:
   - According to the initial state, `i` is set to `n-3`.
   - We don't have an explicit value for `n`, but we know `i` is calculated as `n-3`.

2. **Expression `'2 %d' % i`**:
   - This is a string formatting operation where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer.
   - The value of `i` will be inserted into the string at the position of `%d`.
   - Therefore, `'2 %d' % i` will output a string in the form `'2 [value of i]'`.

3. **Expression `*range(1, n + 1)`**:
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, meaning each element of the sequence will be treated as a separate argument to the print function.
   - Thus, `*range(1, n + 1)` will print the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

### Combining the Results:
- The first part of the print statement, `'2 %d' % i`, will print `'2 [value of i]'`.
- The second part, `*range(1, n + 1)`, will print the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
- Since `i` is `n-3`, the exact printed string will depend on the value of `n`.
- However, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **2 [n-3] 1 2 3 ... n (where [n-3] is the value of n-3 and n is a positive integer greater than 0)**

To make it more precise, letâ€™s assume `n` has a specific value for clarity. For example, if `n` were 5, then `i` would be 2, and the output would be:
Output: **2 2 1 2 3 4 5**

But since we don't have a specific value for `n`, the most precise description based on the given information is:
Output: **2 [n-3] 1 2 3 ... n (where [n-3] is the value of n-3 and n is a positive integer greater than 0)**
