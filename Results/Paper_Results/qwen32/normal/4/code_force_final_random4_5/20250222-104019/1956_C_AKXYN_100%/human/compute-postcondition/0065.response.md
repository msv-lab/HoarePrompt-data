To determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop iterates from `n` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing `i` in each iteration. The loop prints two lines for each iteration, but does not modify the variables `res`, `t`, `n`, or `mat`. The only variable that changes is `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `res` is 110
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0
- `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`
- `i` is `n-1` (which is the starting point of the loop)

The loop will execute `n` times, starting with `i` equal to `n` and decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches 1.

After all iterations, `i` will be 0 (since the loop stops when `i` is 1, and it decrements one more time to 0, but the loop exits before reaching this point).

Thus, the final state of the variables is:
- `res` remains 110
- `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 500
- `n` remains a positive integer greater than 0
- `mat` remains a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`
- `i` is 0 (after the loop finishes)

Output State: **res is 110, t is a positive integer between 1 and 500, n is a positive integer greater than 0, mat is a matrix with n rows and n columns where each row contains integers from 1 to n, i is 0**.

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be 0, while the variables `res`, `t`, `n`, and `mat` will remain unchanged from their initial states.
