The code snippet `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` updates the value of `res` by adding the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it. Given that `i` is initially 0, the expression evaluates to `(0 + 1) * (2 * 0 + 1)`, which simplifies to `1 * 1` or `1`. Therefore, `res` is incremented by `1`, changing its value from `0` to `1`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mat`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is 1, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 0**.
