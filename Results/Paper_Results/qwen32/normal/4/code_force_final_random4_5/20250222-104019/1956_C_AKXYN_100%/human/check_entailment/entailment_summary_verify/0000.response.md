Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix \( a \) using Type 1 and Type 2 operations.
- **Operations**:
  - Type 1: Assign a row \( i \) with a permutation \( p \).
  - Type 2: Assign a column \( i \) with a permutation \( p \).
- **Constraints**: No more than \( 2n \) operations.
- **Output**: The maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program does the following for each test case:
1. **Matrix Initialization**: Creates an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with permutations.
2. **Sum Calculation**: Computes `res` using the formula:
   \[
   \text{res} += (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)
   \]
3. **Operations Generation**: Prints \( 2n \) operations, filling each row and column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates a sum `res` and prints it along with `n << 1` (which is \( 2n \)).
- It prints a series of operations that fill the matrix using permutations.

### Issues in the Original Assessment:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula used in the program for `res` is incorrect. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, when filled optimally, is:
     \[
     \text{Maximum Sum} = n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
     \]
     This is because each row and column can be filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, and the sum of this permutation is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \). Since there are \( n \) rows, the total sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Operations**:
   - The operations printed by the program are:
     ```python
     for i in range(n, 0, -1):
         print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
         print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
     ```
     These operations fill each row and column from \( n \) down to \( 1 \) with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This approach does ensure that each cell in the matrix is assigned the highest possible value, thus maximizing the sum.

### Correctness of the Program:
- **Sum Calculation**: The correct formula for the maximum sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \). The program's formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` does not match this, so the sum calculation is incorrect.
- **Operations**: The operations printed by the program do maximize the sum of the matrix, but the sum calculation is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **partially correct**. The operations printed by the program are correct in terms of maximizing the sum, but the sum calculation is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

**Final: False**
