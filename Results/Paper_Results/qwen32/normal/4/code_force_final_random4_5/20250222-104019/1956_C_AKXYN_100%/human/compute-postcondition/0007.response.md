The code snippet `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` updates the value of `res` by adding `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to its current value. Given the initial state, `res` is initially `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. After the execution of the code, `res` will be the sum of its initial value and the new expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. This means `res` will effectively be `2 * (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `mat` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is not updated in the given code snippet, so it remains `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is `2 * (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
