The given code snippet modifies the variable `res` by adding the value of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, which means its value is unknown. Therefore, we can only express the new value of `res` in terms of `i`.

Given that `res` was initially 0, after executing the code snippet, `res` will be equal to `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `mat`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`**.
