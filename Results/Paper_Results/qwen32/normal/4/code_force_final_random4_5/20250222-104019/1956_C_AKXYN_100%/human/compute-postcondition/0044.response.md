The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop iterates for a number of times determined by the integer input. Since the underscore does not affect the loop's logic, the only state we need to adjust is the number of iterations left, which is controlled by the input integer.

At the end of the previous iteration, `res` is 110, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` is the input integer, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the number of iterations (input integer) must be decremented by 1.

State: **`res` is 110, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` is the input integer, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 0**
