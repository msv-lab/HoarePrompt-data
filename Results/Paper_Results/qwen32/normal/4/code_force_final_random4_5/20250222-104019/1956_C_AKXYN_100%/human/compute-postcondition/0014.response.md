To determine the exact output of the given print statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the code snippet provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500.
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `mat` is an `n x n` matrix where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`.
- `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**:
   - The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state. Therefore, we need to infer its value.
   - Given the context, it is likely that `i` is a loop variable in a loop that iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`. However, since `i` is not defined in the provided initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. For the purpose of this explanation, we will assume `i` is a specific value within the range 0 to `n-1`.

2. **String Formatting**:
   - The string `'2 %d' % i` formats the integer `i` into a string, placing it after the character '2'. This means the output will start with '2' followed by the value of `i`.

3. **`range(1, n + 1)`**:
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` part of the print statement unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and prints each element separated by a space.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, `range(1, n + 1)` will be `range(1, 6)`, which is equivalent to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n` is 5 for this example, and `i` is 3 (a hypothetical value within the range 0 to 4).

- The string `'2 %d' % i` becomes `'2 3'` because `i` is 3.
- The unpacked range `*range(1, n + 1)` becomes `1 2 3 4 5`.

### Output:
Combining the formatted string and the unpacked range, the output will be:
```
2 3 1 2 3 4 5
```

### General Output:
Given that `i` can be any integer from 0 to `n-1`, the output will be:
```
2 [i] 1 2 3 ... [n]
```
Where `[i]` is the value of `i` and `[n]` is the value of `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 [i] 1 2 3 ... [n] (where [i] is the value of i and [n] is the value of n)**

Since `i` is not explicitly defined, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `i`. However, we can describe the output format precisely based on the given information.
