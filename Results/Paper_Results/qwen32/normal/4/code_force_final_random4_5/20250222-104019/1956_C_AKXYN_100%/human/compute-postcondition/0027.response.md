The code snippet provided modifies the variable `res` by adding the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it. Given that `i` is initially 1, we can calculate the new value of `res` as follows:

- `i + 1` equals `1 + 1` which is `2`.
- `2 * i + 1` equals `2 * 1 + 1` which is `3`.
- Therefore, `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` equals `2 * 3` which is `6`.
- `res`, which was initially `0`, is now `0 + 6` which equals `6`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mat`) are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 6, `i` is 1**.
