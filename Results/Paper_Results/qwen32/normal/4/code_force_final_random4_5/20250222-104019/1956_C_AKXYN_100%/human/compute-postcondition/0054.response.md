To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to compute the value of `res` after the loop has iterated `n` times. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(n):
    res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
```

We have already computed the values of `res` for the first 3 iterations:

- After 1 iteration: `res` is 1
- After 2 iterations: `res` is 7
- After 3 iterations: `res` is 22

The expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` computes the sum of the first `n` odd squares. To find the final value of `res` after `n` iterations, we can use the formula for the sum of the first `n` odd squares, which is:

\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{3} \]

Let's compute this for a general `n` and then use the specific value of `n` provided in the initial state.

Given the initial state, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. Let's assume `n` is the number of iterations the loop will run. For the sake of this example, let's assume `n` is 5 (since the matrix `mat` is `n x n` and we need a specific value to compute the final `res`).

Let's compute the final `res` for `n = 5`:

\[ \text{res} = \frac{5 \times (5 + 1) \times (2 \times 5 + 1)}{3} = \frac{5 \times 6 \times 11}{3} = 110 \]

Now, let's generalize this for any `n` and compute the final `res` using Python code to ensure accuracy.
```python
# Function to compute the final value of res after n iterations
def compute_final_res(n):
    return (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) // 3

# Let's assume n is 5 for the sake of this example
n = 5
final_res = compute_final_res(n)
print(final_res)
```
```output
110
```
The final value of `res` after all iterations of the loop, assuming `n` is 5, is 110. 

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

Output State: **res is 110, t is a positive integer between 1 and 500, n is a positive integer greater than 0, mat is a matrix with n rows and n columns where each row contains integers from 1 to n, i is n-1**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `res` will be 110, `t` will remain a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` will remain a positive integer greater than 0, `mat` will remain a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, and `i` will be equal to `n-1` (which is 4 in this case since `n` is 5).
