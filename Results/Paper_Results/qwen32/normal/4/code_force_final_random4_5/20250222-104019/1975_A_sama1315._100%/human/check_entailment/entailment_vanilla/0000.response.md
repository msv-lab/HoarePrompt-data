### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where we split the array into two parts and swap them. The key insight is that if the array can be sorted by such operations, then some rotation of the array should be the sorted version of the array. 

Here's how the provided program works:

1. **Concatenation Approach**: The function `func_1(a)` concatenates the array `a` with itself. This is done to simulate all possible rotations of the array `a` within a single array. For example, if `a = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`, then `concatenated_a = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`. 

2. **Checking for Sorted Subarray**: The program then checks if any subarray of `concatenated_a` of length `n` (the original length of `a`) matches the sorted version of `a`. If it does, it means that some rotation of `a` is sorted, and thus, the answer is "Yes".

3. **Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2()` reads multiple test cases from the input, processes each one using `func_1(a)`, and collects the results. Finally, it prints all the results.

### Correctness:

The approach is correct because:
- By concatenating the array with itself, we can check all possible rotations of the array in a single pass.
- If any rotation of the array matches the sorted array, then it is possible to sort the array using the allowed operations.

Therefore, the program should correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
