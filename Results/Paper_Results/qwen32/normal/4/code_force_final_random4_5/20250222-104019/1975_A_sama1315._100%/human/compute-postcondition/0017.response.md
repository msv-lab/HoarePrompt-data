Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings from `data` starting at index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is `3 + n + n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 1; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1 - n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by `n`, so `idx` becomes `3 + n + n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
