The value of `idx` is incremented by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the elements of `data` from index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is `2 + n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
