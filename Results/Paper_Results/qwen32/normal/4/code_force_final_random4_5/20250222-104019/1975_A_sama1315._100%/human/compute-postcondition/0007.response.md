The code snippet assigns the value of `int(data[idx])` to `n`. Given the initial state, `idx` is 1, so `n` will be the integer value of the second element in the `data` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is 1; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
