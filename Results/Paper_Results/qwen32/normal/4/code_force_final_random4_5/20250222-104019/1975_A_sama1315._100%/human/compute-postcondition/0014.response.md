The code snippet reassigned the value of `n` to be the integer value of `data[idx]`. Before this, `n` was the integer value of `data[1]`. Therefore, `n` is now updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is `2 + n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 1; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
