Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the elements of `data` from index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is 2; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is updated to be a list of integers by converting the elements of `data` from index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers. All other variables remain unchanged.
