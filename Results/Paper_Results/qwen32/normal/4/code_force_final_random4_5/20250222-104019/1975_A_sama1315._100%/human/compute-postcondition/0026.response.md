Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings from `data` starting at index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is `4 + 3*n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`, the value of `result` again, and the value of `result` again; `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. Initially, `results` contained `[result, result]`. After the execution of the code, `results` now contains `[result, result, result]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
