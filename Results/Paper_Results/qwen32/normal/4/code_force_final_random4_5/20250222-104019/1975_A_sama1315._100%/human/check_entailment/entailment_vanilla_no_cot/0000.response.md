Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Concatenation and Subarray Check**: The function `func_1` concatenates the array `a` with itself, forming `concatenated_a`. This allows the function to check if any subarray of length `n` (the original array length) within `concatenated_a` matches the sorted version of `a`. If such a subarray is found, it implies that the array can be rotated to become sorted, and the function returns 'Yes'.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the input, processes each one using `func_1`, and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results for each test case, which matches the problem's requirement to handle multiple test cases.

3. **Output Format**: The program outputs "Yes" or "No" for each test case, which aligns with the problem's output specification.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles arrays of length 2 to 50, as specified in the problem constraints, and works correctly for arrays that are already sorted or can be rotated to become sorted.

Therefore, the program correctly determines whether the array can be sorted by performing the specified operation any number of times.
