The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. The variable `data` is assigned this list of strings. The values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged as they were defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.**
