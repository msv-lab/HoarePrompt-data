Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, so `idx` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
