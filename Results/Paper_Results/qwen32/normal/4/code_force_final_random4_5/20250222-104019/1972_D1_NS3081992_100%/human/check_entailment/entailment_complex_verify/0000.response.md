### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The key condition to satisfy is:
\[ a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]

This can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

Given the constraints, the problem requires an efficient approach to count valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code focuses on `func_15()` which is supposed to solve the problem for each test case. Here is the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

Let's break down the logic:
- The loop runs for \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) such that \(i^2 \leq n + i\).
- For each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // (i^2)\) to the answer.
- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

#### Evaluation of the Code:
1. **Loop Condition**: The condition \(i^2 \leq n + i\) is not a direct way to iterate over all possible values of \(b\). However, this condition is not incorrect in the context of the solution provided. It is a way to limit the range of \(i\) to a manageable size, which is a common optimization technique.

2. **Calculation**: The calculation \((n + i) // (i^2)\) is derived from the problem's constraints and the properties of the gcd. The logic behind this calculation is that for each \(i\), it counts the number of valid \(a\) values such that \(a + i\) is a multiple of \(i^2\). This is a valid approach to count the pairs efficiently.

3. **Subtraction of 1**: The final result is `ans - 1`. This subtraction is likely to account for an overcounting issue or an edge case. The original assessment does not provide a detailed explanation for this subtraction, but it is included in the solution, so we should consider it part of the correct logic.

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the code with the example provided in the problem statement:
```
1
10 8
```
Expected output: 14

The provided code calculates the result as follows:
- For \(i = 1\): \((10 + 1) // (1^2) = 11\)
- For \(i = 2\): \((10 + 2) // (2^2) = 3\)
- For \(i = 3\): \((10 + 3) // (3^2) = 1\)
- For \(i = 4\): \((10 + 4) // (4^2) = 1\)
- For \(i = 5\): \((10 + 5) // (5^2) = 1\)
- For \(i = 6\): \((10 + 6) // (6^2) = 0\)
- For \(i = 7\): \((10 + 7) // (7^2) = 0\)
- For \(i = 8\): \((10 + 8) // (8^2) = 0\)

Sum: \(11 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17\)

Final result after subtraction: \(17 - 1 = 16\)

It seems there is a discrepancy here, which suggests that the provided code might not be correctly handling all cases. However, the original assessment does not provide a detailed explanation of the correct approach, and the provided code seems to be based on a specific mathematical insight.

#### Conclusion:
Given the provided code and the annotations, the original assessment seems to be correct in identifying that the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. The code does not properly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for all possible values of \(b\).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
