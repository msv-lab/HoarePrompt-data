The loop condition in the given `while` loop is `i <= m and i * i <= n + i`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, both conditions must be satisfied.

1. **Condition 1: `i <= m`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4.

2. **Condition 2: `i * i <= n + i`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4. Substituting `i = 4` into the condition, we get:
     \[
     4 * 4 \leq n + 4 \implies 16 \leq n + 4 \implies n \geq 12
     \]
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 12 for this condition to hold true.

Since `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()` and are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 4 and `n` is at least 12.

State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()` such that `m` is at least 4 and `n` is at least 12; `i` is 4; `ans` is `n + 1 + (n + 3) // 9`**
