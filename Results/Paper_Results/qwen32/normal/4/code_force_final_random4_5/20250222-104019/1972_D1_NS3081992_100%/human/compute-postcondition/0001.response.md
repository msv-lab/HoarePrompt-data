The provided code snippet writes the string representation of the return value of `func_15()` to the standard output followed by a newline. The values of `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this code snippet, but the function `func_15()` is called, and its return value is printed.

Since the problem statement does not provide the implementation of `func_15()`, we can only infer that it must return a positive integer, as stated in the precondition. Therefore, the output will be the string representation of a positive integer returned by `func_15()`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and a positive integer has been returned and printed by `func_15()`.**
