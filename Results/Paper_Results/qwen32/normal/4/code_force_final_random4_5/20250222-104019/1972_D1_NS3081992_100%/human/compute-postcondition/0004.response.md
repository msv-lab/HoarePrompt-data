The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used within the loop body. The loop will execute based on the return value of `func_10()`. Since `func_10()` returns a positive integer, the loop will continue as long as the number of iterations has not reached this value.

Given that `func_10()` has already returned a positive integer and a positive integer equal to `func_15()` has been returned and printed, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can execute one more time. This means that the loop counter (which is not explicitly shown but is implied by the range function) should be incremented by 1.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used, we don't need to change its value explicitly. However, we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, which means the loop counter (internal to the `range` function) should be one less than the value returned by `func_10()`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and `func_10()` returns a positive integer; a positive integer equal to `func_15()` has been returned and printed. The loop counter is one less than the value returned by `func_10()`**.

Since we cannot directly modify the loop counter, we represent the state as follows, indicating that the loop is ready for the next iteration based on the range function:

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and `func_10()` returns a positive integer; a positive integer equal to `func_15()` has been returned and printed.**
