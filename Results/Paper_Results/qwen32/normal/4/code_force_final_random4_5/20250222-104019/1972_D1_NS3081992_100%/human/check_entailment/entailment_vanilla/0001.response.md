Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\). This implies:
\[ a = (k-1) \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

From this, we can deduce that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Let's denote \(g = \gcd(a, b)\), then \(a = g \cdot x\) and \(b = g \cdot y\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes:
\[ g \cdot x + g \cdot y = k \cdot g \cdot x \cdot y \]
\[ x + y = k \cdot x \cdot y \]
\[ k = \frac{x + y}{x \cdot y} \]

For \(k\) to be an integer, \(x + y\) must be divisible by \(x \cdot y\). This happens when \(x = 1\) or \(y = 1\), or when \(x\) and \(y\) are small integers that satisfy the equation.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program includes several functions, but only `func_15` and `func_16` are relevant to solving the problem. `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case. `func_15` seems to implement the logic to count the valid pairs.

Here's a breakdown of `func_15`:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

- It reads \(n\) and \(m\).
- It initializes `ans` to 0.
- It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n + i}\) (approximately).
- For each \(i\), it adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i \cdot i} \right\rfloor\) to `ans`.
- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

### Correctness Check:
The logic in `func_15` seems to be attempting to count the number of valid pairs by leveraging the properties of the gcd and the condition \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the implementation does not correctly account for all valid pairs.

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic to count the pairs is incorrect. The correct approach involves iterating over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition directly or using a more efficient mathematical approach.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
