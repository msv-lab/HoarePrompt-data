Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()` such that `m` is at least 4 and `n` is at least 12; `i` is 4; `ans` is `n + 1 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16`**

In the output state, the values of `n` and `m` remain the same as they were initially, with `m` being at least 4 and `n` being at least 12. The value of `i` remains 4. The value of `ans` is updated to include the additional term `(n + i) // (i * i)`, which simplifies to `(n + 4) // 16` given that `i` is 4.
