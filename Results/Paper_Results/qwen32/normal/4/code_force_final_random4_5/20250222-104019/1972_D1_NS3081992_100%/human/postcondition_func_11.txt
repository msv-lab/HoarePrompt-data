The function `func_12` calculates a rank for a given integer `da` based on the structure of the dictionary `d` and the list `processing`. It returns 1 if the list associated with `da` in `d` contains only one element. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the rank for each element in the list associated with `da` and returns the minimum rank found plus one. The rank for `da` is stored in the `rank` list at the index `da - 1`.
