The function `drank` is not correctly defined according to the problem description. The correct function should take two positive integers `n` and `m` as input, representing the constraints for the ordered pairs (a, b). The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and each subsequent line contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6). The function should return the number of valid ordered pairs (a, b) for each test case, where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).
