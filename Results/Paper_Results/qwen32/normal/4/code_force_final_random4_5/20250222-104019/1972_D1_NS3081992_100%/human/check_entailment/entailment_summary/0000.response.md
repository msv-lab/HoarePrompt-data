### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_15()` which calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The function `func_15()` calculates the sum of the expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all integers \(i\) from 1 up to, but not including, \(i_{\text{final}}\), where \(i_{\text{final}}\) is the smallest integer that is either greater than \(m\) or satisfies \(i * i > n + i\). The function returns this sum minus one.

3. **Function `func_15()` Analysis**:
   - The logic inside `func_15()` seems to be based on a mathematical observation or a formula to count the number of valid pairs. However, it does not directly implement a brute-force approach which would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition.
   - The formula used in `func_15()` is \((n + i) // (i * i)\) and it iterates over \(i\) up to a certain limit. This suggests that the formula is derived from some mathematical insight about the problem.

4. **Verification Against Example**:
   - Let's verify the function `func_15()` with the provided examples.
   - For the first test case \((n, m) = (1, 1)\):
     - The function calculates the sum for \(i = 1\):
       \[
       (1 + 1) // (1 * 1) = 2 // 1 = 2
       \]
       - Subtracting 1 gives the result \(1\), which is correct.
   - For the fourth test case \((n, m) = (10, 8)\):
     - The function calculates the sum for \(i = 1\) to \(i = 3\):
       \[
       (10 + 1) // (1 * 1) = 11 // 1 = 11
       \]
       \[
       (10 + 2) // (2 * 2) = 12 // 4 = 3
       \]
       \[
       (10 + 3) // (3 * 3) = 13 // 9 = 1
       \]
       - Summing these values gives \(11 + 3 + 1 = 15\).
       - Subtracting 1 gives the result \(14\), which is correct.
   - The function seems to be correctly implemented based on the provided examples.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_15()` appears to correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs based on the derived formula.
   - The main function `func_16()` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_15()` for each test case and printing the results.

### Correctness: **True**
