Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and `func_10()` returns a positive integer; a positive integer equal to `func_15()` has been returned and printed.**

Explanation: The code snippet `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` writes to the standard output the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()`, followed by a newline character. This action does not change the values of `n` and `m` or the behavior of `func_10()`. The only effect is that the value of `func_15()` is printed.
