You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\). This implies:
\[ a = (k-1) \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

From this, we can deduce that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Let's denote \(g = \gcd(a, b)\), then \(a = g \cdot x\) and \(b = g \cdot y\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes:
\[ g \cdot x + g \cdot y = k \cdot g \cdot x \cdot y \]
\[ x + y = k \cdot x \cdot y \]
\[ k = \frac{x + y}{x \cdot y} \]

For \(k\) to be an integer, \(x + y\) must be divisible by \(x \cdot y\). This happens when \(x = 1\) or \(y = 1\), or when \(x\) and \(y\) are small integers that satisfy the equation.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program includes several functions, but only `func_15` and `func_16` are relevant to solving the problem. `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case. `func_15` seems to implement the logic to count the valid pairs.

Here's a breakdown of `func_15`:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

- It reads \(n\) and \(m\).
- It initializes `ans` to 0.
- It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n + i}\) (approximately).
- For each \(i\), it adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i \cdot i} \right\rfloor\) to `ans`.
- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

### Correctness Check:
The logic in `func_15` seems to be attempting to count the number of valid pairs by leveraging the properties of the gcd and the condition \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the implementation does not correctly account for all valid pairs.

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic to count the pairs is incorrect. The correct approach involves iterating over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition directly or using a more efficient mathematical approach.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
