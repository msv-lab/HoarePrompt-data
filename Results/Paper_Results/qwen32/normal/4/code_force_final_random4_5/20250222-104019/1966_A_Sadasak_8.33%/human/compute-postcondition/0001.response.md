The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which iterates over the elements in the list `arr`. To ensure that the loop can execute, the list `arr` must have at least one element. The variables `k`, `n` (length of `arr`), and `frequency_table` are not directly related to the execution of the loop itself, but they are part of the given state.

Here is the adjusted state for the loop to execute:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and must have at least 1 element, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` (n) is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**.
