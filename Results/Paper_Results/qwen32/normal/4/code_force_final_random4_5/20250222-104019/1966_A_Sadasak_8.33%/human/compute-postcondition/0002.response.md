The code snippet updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by incrementing the count of the `num` element. Since the initial state specifies that `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary, after executing this line, `frequency_table` will have an entry for `num` with a value of 1 if `num` was not previously in the dictionary, or it will increment the existing value by 1 if `num` was already present.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and must have at least 1 element, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` (n) is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and its value incremented by 1.**
