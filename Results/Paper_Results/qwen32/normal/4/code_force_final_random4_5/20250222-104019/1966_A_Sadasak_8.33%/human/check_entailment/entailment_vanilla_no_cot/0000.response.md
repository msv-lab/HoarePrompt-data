Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Frequency Table**: The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the frequency of each card number, but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k` for each card. This is not the intended behavior. The frequency should reflect the actual count of each card number in the hand.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards**: The logic to determine the minimum number of cards left is flawed. The program checks if `k` is in the frequency table values, which is not a valid condition to determine the minimum number of cards left. Instead, the program should calculate the minimum number of cards left based on the operation rules provided.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the frequency of each card number
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        # For each group of 'k' cards, we can reduce the count by 'k-1'
        min_cards += count % k
    
    # If min_cards is 0, it means we can reduce all groups to 'k-1' cards,
    # but we must have at least one card left
    if min_cards == 0:
        min_cards = k
    
    print(min_cards)
```

This corrected program calculates the frequency of each card number, then determines the minimum number of cards left by considering the remainder when each count is divided by `k`. If the result is 0, it sets the minimum number of cards to `k` to ensure there is at least one card left.
