### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program and its behavior based on the problem description, the program code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to minimize the number of cards by performing operations where we can exchange `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards of any number.
- The goal is to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing any number of such operations.

#### Program Code Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and the list of card numbers.

2. **Special Cases:**
   - **If `k > n`:** No operations can be performed, so the answer is `n`. This is correctly handled.
   - **If `k == n`:** One operation can be performed, reducing the number of cards by 1. This is correctly handled.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each number but caps the frequency at `k`. This is incorrect because we need the actual frequency to determine how many operations can be performed. Capping the frequency at `k` does not help in determining the optimal number of operations.

4. **Output Logic:**
   - The program checks if `k` is in the frequency values, which is not a correct condition to determine the minimum number of cards. The correct approach would be to calculate the remaining count after performing the maximum possible operations based on the actual frequencies.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1` is supposed to return a dictionary where each key is a unique number from `arr` and its value is the minimum of the number's occurrences in `arr` and `k`. However, this is not the correct approach for solving the problem as it does not help in determining the minimum number of cards after performing the operations.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Frequency Calculation:** The function `func_1` incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`, which is not needed and leads to incorrect results.
- **Incorrect Output Logic:** The program does not correctly calculate the remaining number of cards after performing the operations.

#### Correct Approach:
- **Calculate the actual frequency of each card.**
- **For each card, determine how many operations can be performed (`m // k` where `m` is the frequency of the card).**
- **Calculate the remaining number of cards as the sum of `(m % k)` for all cards.**

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final: **False**
