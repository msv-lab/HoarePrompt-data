Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards; `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; the length of `arr` (n) is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is a unique number from `arr` and its value is the minimum of the number's occurrences in `arr` and `k`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `frequency_table` will contain each unique number from the list `arr` as keys, and the value for each key will be the count of how many times that number appears in `arr`, but no more than `k`.
