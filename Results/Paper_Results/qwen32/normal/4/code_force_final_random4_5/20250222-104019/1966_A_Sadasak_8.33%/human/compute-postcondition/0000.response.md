The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary named `frequency_table`. This dictionary will be used to store the frequency of each integer in the list `arr`. The variables `arr` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` (n) is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.**
