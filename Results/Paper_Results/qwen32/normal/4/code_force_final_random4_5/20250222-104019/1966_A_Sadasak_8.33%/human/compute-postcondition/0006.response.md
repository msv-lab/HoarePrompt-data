The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the last element processed from `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least one more element that has not been processed yet.

Given that `num` was the last element processed, at the start of the next iteration, `num` will be the next element in the list `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 2 elements; `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; the length of `arr` (n) is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, then the value of `frequency_table[num]` is `k`. Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged; `num` is the next element in the list `arr`.**
