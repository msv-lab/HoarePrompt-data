Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 1 element; `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; the length of `arr` (n) is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and its value is `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `frequency_table[num]` has been set to `k`, and all other conditions and variables remain as specified in the initial state.
