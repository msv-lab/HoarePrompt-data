### Reasoning:
Let's break down the logic of the provided program and verify if it aligns with the problem requirements.

1. **Sum of Scores Modulo 2:**
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the program outputs `-1`. This is correct because every game results in an even number of points being distributed (either 2 to the winner, 0 to the loser, or 1 to each player in case of a draw). Therefore, the total sum of points across all games must be even. If the sum is odd, it's impossible to have reached those scores through a series of valid games.

2. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum of scores is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
     \]
   - **Understanding the Formula:**
     - The term `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` gives the total points.
     - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` is used to account for the scenario where player 3 (with the highest score) has more points than the combined points of players 1 and 2. This difference must be accounted for by wins (not draws) because draws distribute points equally.
     - Subtracting this difference from the total points and then dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of draws.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **No Games Played:** When all scores are 0, the sum is even, and the formula correctly outputs `0` (no draws).
   - **All Draws:** When all scores are equal, the formula correctly calculates the maximum number of draws.
   - **Impossible Scores:** When the scores cannot be achieved through valid games, the program correctly outputs `-1`.

### Verification:
- The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program:
  - For `0 0 0`, the output is `0`.
  - For `0 1 1`, the output is `1`.
  - For `1 1 1`, the output is `-1`.
  - For `1 1 2`, the output is `2`.
  - For `3 3 3`, the output is `-1`.
  - For `3 4 5`, the output is `6`.
  - For `1 1 10`, the output is `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given scenarios and adheres to the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: True**
