Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd, the postcondition is as given in the if part. Otherwise, if the sum of the first three elements of `v` is even, `result` is an integer calculated as `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.***
