The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `v`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer equal to 1, and `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. These conditions on `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
