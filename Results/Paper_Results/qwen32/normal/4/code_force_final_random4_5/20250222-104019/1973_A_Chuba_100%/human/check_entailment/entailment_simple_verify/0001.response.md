### Reasoning

The original assessment provides a thorough analysis of the problem and the program. It correctly identifies the key points and the logic behind the solution. Let's break down the reasoning and verify it step by step.

1. **Parity Check**: The program correctly checks if the total points `p1 + p2 + p3` are even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because an odd total score cannot be achieved with the given scoring rules (each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed).

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3) - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)}{2}
   \]
   This formula ensures that we maximize the number of draws by minimizing the points attributed to wins. Here's a detailed breakdown of the formula:
   - **Case 1**: If `p3 - p1 - p2` is negative or zero, `max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)` evaluates to `0`. This means the formula simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{p1 + p2 + p3}{2}
     \]
     This is the maximum number of draws possible if all points can be attributed to draws.
   - **Case 2**: If `p3 - p1 - p2` is positive, it means that `p3` has more points than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, indicating that `p3` must have won some games. The formula subtracts this difference from the total points to account for the points attributed to wins:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3) - (p3 - p1 - p2)}{2} = \frac{2(p1 + p2)}{2} = p1 + p2
     \]
     This ensures that the points attributed to wins are correctly accounted for, and the rest are attributed to draws.

3. **Testing**: The original assessment provides several test cases that the program passes correctly. The test cases cover various scenarios, including cases with no games played, cases with draws, and cases with invalid scores.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or to identify inconsistent scores. The annotations and the original assessment provide a solid explanation and verification of the program's correctness.

**Final: True**
