To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify whether it correctly calculates the maximum number of draws based on the provided problem description and constraints.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic the program should implement and how it compares to the provided code:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the scores of the three players, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, ensuring `p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3`.

2. **Validation**:
   - The sum of all scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` must be even. This is because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win/loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw) to the total score.

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - If the sum of scores is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws.
   - To maximize the number of draws, we need to minimize the number of win/loss outcomes.
   - The formula used in the program is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3) - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)}{2}
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated by first accounting for any necessary win/loss outcomes (which is `max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)`) and then distributing the remaining points as draws.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where no games were played (`p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`), resulting in `0` draws.
   - It correctly identifies invalid score combinations that cannot be achieved by any set of games (e.g., `p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 1`), resulting in `-1`.

After analyzing the logic and comparing it with the provided code, it appears that the program correctly implements the required logic to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given scores.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
