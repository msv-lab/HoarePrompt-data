To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the behavior of the loop over all `t` iterations. The loop processes each set of three scores (`p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`) and prints either `-1` if the sum of the scores is odd, or a calculated `result` if the sum is even.

Here's a breakdown of the loop's behavior:
1. **Loop Iteration**: For each iteration, the loop reads three integers (`p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`) and stores them in the list `v`.
2. **Condition Check**: It checks if the sum of the elements in `v` is odd or even.
3. **Output**:
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`.
   - If the sum is even, it calculates `result` as `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` and prints this value.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to process each test case in the same manner until all `t` test cases have been processed.

**Output State after all iterations**:
- The loop will have processed all `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it will have printed either `-1` (if the sum of the scores is odd) or the calculated `result` (if the sum is even).

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the state of variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `v` are reset for each iteration, the final output state is simply the series of outputs (either `-1` or the calculated `result`) for each of the `t` test cases.

Output State: **The loop will print the result for each of the `t` test cases, which is either `-1` if the sum of the scores is odd, or `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` if the sum is even.**

In simple terms: The final output state is a series of `t` lines, each containing either `-1` or the calculated result for each set of scores.
