To calculate the output state, we need to evaluate the expression for `result` based on the initial state provided:

The expression for `result` is:
```
result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
```

Let's break down the expression:
- `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]` are the first three elements of the list `v`.
- `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the value inside the `max` function does not go below 0. If `v[2] - v[0] - v[1]` is negative, `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` will be 0; otherwise, it will be `v[2] - v[0] - v[1]`.

The final result is the integer division by 2 of the entire expression.

The values of `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are not affected by this computation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `result` is calculated as `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.**
