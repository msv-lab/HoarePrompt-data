Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, with the condition that `p1 <= p2 <= p3`. The total points distributed in each game are either 2 (if one player wins) or 2 (if the game is a draw, with both players getting 1 point each). Therefore, the total points `p1 + p2 + p3` must be even.

### Key Points

1. **Parity Check**: The total points `p1 + p2 + p3` must be even. If the sum is odd, it's impossible to distribute the points according to the problem's rules, and we should return `-1`.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: If the sum of points is even, we need to find the maximum possible number of draws. The formula used in the program is:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3) - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)}{2}
   \]
   This formula tries to maximize the number of draws by minimizing the points that must be attributed to wins.

### Program Analysis

The program follows these steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
3. It checks if the total points `p1 + p2 + p3` are even. If not, it prints `-1`.
4. If the total points are even, it calculates the result using the formula provided and prints it.

### Verification

Let's verify the formula used in the program.

- The term `max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)` ensures that we do not subtract a negative number, which would incorrectly increase the number of draws.
- The formula `((p1 + p2 + p3) - max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)) // 2` calculates the maximum number of draws by considering the points that must be attributed to wins and the rest to draws.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Input**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: `0` (even)
   - Draws: `0`
   - Output: `0` (correct)

2. **Input**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: `2` (even)
   - Draws: `1`
   - Output: `1` (correct)

3. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: `3` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (correct)

4. **Input**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: `4` (even)
   - Draws: `2`
   - Output: `2` (correct)

5. **Input**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: `9` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (correct)

6. **Input**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: `12` (even)
   - Draws: `6`
   - Output: `6` (correct)

7. **Input**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: `12` (even)
   - Draws: `2`
   - Output: `2` (correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or to identify inconsistent scores. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
