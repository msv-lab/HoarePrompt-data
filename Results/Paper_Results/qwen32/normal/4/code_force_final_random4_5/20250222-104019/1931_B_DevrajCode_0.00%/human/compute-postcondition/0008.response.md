Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of the list `a`, `total_water % n` equals 0, `target` is `total_water // n`, `container` is `container` + (`water` - `target`), and the current value of `container` is less than 0**
