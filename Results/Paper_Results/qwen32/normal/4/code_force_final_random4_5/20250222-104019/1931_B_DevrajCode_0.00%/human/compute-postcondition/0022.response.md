Functionality: **The function `func_1` determines if it's possible to redistribute the water in the list `a` such that each of the `n` containers has the same amount of water, given that the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. It returns 'Yes' if the redistribution is possible without any container having a negative amount of water at any step, otherwise it returns 'No'.**
