The code appends the integer value of `xylist[0]` to the list `x`. Since `x` already contains the integer value of the first substring of `t` and `xylist[0]`, after the append operation, `x` will have the integer value of `xylist[0]` repeated twice. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input value; `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first substring of `t` twice; `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second substring of `t` and the integer value of `xylist[1]`; `xylist` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string by spaces; `i` is 10.**
