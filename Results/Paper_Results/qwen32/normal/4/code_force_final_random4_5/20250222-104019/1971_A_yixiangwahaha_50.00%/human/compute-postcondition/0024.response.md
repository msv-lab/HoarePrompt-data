Let's break down the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a string representing the input value.
   - `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first substring of `t` ten times.
   - `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second substring of `t` ten times.
   - `xylist` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the last input string `t` by spaces.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Condition:**
   - If `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, then `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`.
   - Otherwise, `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
   ```

4. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is 1, so we are interested in the second elements of `x` and `y` (since list indexing starts at 0).
   - `x` is a list where each element is the integer value of the first substring of `t`, repeated ten times.
   - `y` is a list where each element is the integer value of the second substring of `t`, repeated ten times.
   - Therefore, `x[1]` is the integer value of the first substring of `t`, and `y[1]` is the integer value of the second substring of `t`.

5. **Output Explanation:**
   - The print statement will output the second element of `y` followed by a space and the second element of `x`.
   - Since `x` and `y` are constructed from the substrings of `t`, and `i` is 1, the output will be the integer value of the second substring of `t` followed by a space and the integer value of the first substring of `t`.

Given the structure of the problem, the exact numerical values depend on the specific input string `t`. However, we can describe the output format precisely:

Output: **[second substring of t as integer] [first substring of t as integer] (where [second substring of t as integer] is the integer value of the second substring of t and [first substring of t as integer] is the integer value of the first substring of t)**
