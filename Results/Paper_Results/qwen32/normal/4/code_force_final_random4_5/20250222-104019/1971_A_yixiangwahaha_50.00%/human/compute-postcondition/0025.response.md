Postcondition: **`t` is a string representing the input value; `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first substring of `t` ten times; `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second substring of `t` ten times; `xylist` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the last input string by spaces; `i` is 1. If the current value of `x[i]` is less than the current value of `y[i]`, then `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`. Otherwise, `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`.**

Since the postconditions for both the if and else parts are identical and do not introduce any new changes to the variables, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
