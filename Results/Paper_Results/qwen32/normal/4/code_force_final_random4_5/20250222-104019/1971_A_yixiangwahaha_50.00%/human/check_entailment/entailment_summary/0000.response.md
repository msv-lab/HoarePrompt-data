Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers, and output the minimum and maximum of each pair. However, there is a discrepancy between the problem description and the implementation. The problem description specifies that the number of test cases `t` can be up to 100, but the program is hardcoded to only handle exactly 10 test cases. This means that if the input `t` is not 10, the program will not behave as expected. Additionally, the program does not use the value of `t` for controlling the number of iterations in the loop, which is another issue.

Given the execution summary, it seems to describe a behavior where the program correctly identifies and prints the minimum and maximum of each pair, but this is under the assumption that there are always exactly 10 test cases, which is not what the problem statement requires.

Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description, as it does not correctly handle the varying number of test cases specified by `t`.

Correctness: **False**
