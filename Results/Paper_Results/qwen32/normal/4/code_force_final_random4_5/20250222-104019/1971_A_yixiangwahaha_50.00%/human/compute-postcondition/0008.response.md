The code snippet `xylist = input().split(' ')` takes an input string, splits it by spaces, and assigns the resulting list to `xylist`. This means the previous value of `xylist` is overwritten by the new list generated from the input.

The variables `t`, `x`, `y`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input value; `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first substring of `t`; `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second substring of `t`; `xylist` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string by spaces; `i` is 9.**
