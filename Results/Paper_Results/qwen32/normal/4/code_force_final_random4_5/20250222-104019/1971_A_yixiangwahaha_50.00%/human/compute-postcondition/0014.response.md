The code appends the integer value of `xylist[1]` to the list `y`. Since `y` already contains the integer value of the second substring of `t` and `xylist[1]`, appending `int(xylist[1])` to `y` means that `y` will now contain the integer value of the second substring of `t` twice.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input value; `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first substring of `t` twice; `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second substring of `t` twice; `xylist` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string by spaces; `i` is 10.**
