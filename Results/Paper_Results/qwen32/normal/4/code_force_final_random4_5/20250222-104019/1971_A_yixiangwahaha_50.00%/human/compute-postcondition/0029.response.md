Postcondition: **`t` is a string representing the input value; `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first substring of `t` ten times; `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second substring of `t` ten times; `xylist` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the last input string by spaces; `i` is 2. If the current value of `x[i]` is less than the current value of `y[i]`, then `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`. Otherwise, `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`.**

In simpler terms: **`t` remains a string representing the input value, `x` and `y` remain lists of integers derived from substrings of `t`, and `xylist` remains a list of substrings from `t` split by spaces. The value of `i` is 2. The relationship between `x[i]` and `y[i]` is preserved: `x[i]` is either less than `y[i]` or greater than or equal to `y[i]`.**
