The code appends the integer value of the second element in `xylist` to the list `y`. 

Given the initial state, `y` initially contains the integer value of the second substring of `t`. After executing the line `y.append(int(xylist[1]))`, `y` will now contain two elements: the initial integer value of the second substring of `t`, and the integer value of `xylist[1]`.

The values of `t`, `x`, `xylist`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input value; `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first substring of `t` and the integer value of `xylist[0]`; `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second substring of `t` and the integer value of `xylist[1]`; `xylist` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string by spaces; `i` is 9.**
