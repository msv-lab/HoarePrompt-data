The code appends the integer value of the second substring of `t` (which is `xylist[1]`) to the list `y`. Therefore, `y` will now contain one element, which is the integer value of `xylist[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input value; `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first substring of `t`; `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second substring of `t`; `xylist` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `t` by spaces.**
