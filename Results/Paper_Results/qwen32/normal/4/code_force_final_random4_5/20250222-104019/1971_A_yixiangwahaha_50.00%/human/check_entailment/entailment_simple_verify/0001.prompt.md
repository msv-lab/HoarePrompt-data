You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, there are two space-separated integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
        
    #State: `t` is a string representing the input value; `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first substring of `t` ten times; `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second substring of `t` ten times; `xylist` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the last input string by spaces; `i` is 10.
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
        
    #State: `t` is a string representing the input value; `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first substring of `t` ten times; `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second substring of `t` ten times; `xylist` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the last input string by spaces; `i` is 10.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program is intended to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `y`.
2. The first line of input specifies the number of test cases `t`. However, the program currently ignores this value and assumes there are always 10 test cases. This is incorrect because `t` can be any value between 1 and 100.
3. The program reads inputs and stores the values of `x` and `y` in two separate lists, `x` and `y`.
4. For each pair of `x` and `y`, the program correctly determines and prints the minimum followed by the maximum value.

Since the program does not correctly handle the number of test cases specified by `t`, it is incorrect for all cases where `t` is not 10.

Correctness: **False**
