Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it assumes there are always exactly 10 test cases, regardless of the value of `t` that is input. The problem statement specifies that the number of test cases `t` can vary between 1 and 100, so the program should use `t` to determine the number of iterations in the loop, not the fixed number 10. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
    for _ in range(t):  # Loop over the number of test cases
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x = int(xylist[0])
        y = int(xylist[1])
        # Print the minimum and maximum of x and y
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))

# Call the function to execute the program
func()
```

This version reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, correctly handling the varying number of test cases as specified in the problem description.
