Reasoning:

1. The program is intended to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `y`.
2. The first line of input specifies the number of test cases `t`. However, the program currently ignores this value and assumes there are always 10 test cases. This is incorrect because `t` can be any value between 1 and 100.
3. The program reads inputs and stores the values of `x` and `y` in two separate lists, `x` and `y`.
4. For each pair of `x` and `y`, the program correctly determines and prints the minimum followed by the maximum value.

Since the program does not correctly handle the number of test cases specified by `t`, it is incorrect for all cases where `t` is not 10.

Correctness: **False**
