The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, in the provided code snippet, there is no loop structure, so the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the program flow. Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `k`) will be affected by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. If `k` is 1, the current value of `k` is 1. Otherwise, `k` retains its original value. The current value of `k` satisfies either `k <= 2 * n` or `k > 2 * n`.**
