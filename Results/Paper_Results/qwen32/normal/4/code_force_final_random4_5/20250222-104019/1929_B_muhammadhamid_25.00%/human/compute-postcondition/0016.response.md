Let's break down the provided initial state and the code snippet to determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this problem.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- If `k` was 1, it remains 1; otherwise, `k` retains its original value.
- The current value of `k` satisfies either `k <= 2 * n` or `k > 2 * n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(math.ceil(k / 2))
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement calculates the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2 using the `math.ceil` function. The `math.ceil` function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to its argument.

- **`k / 2`**: This is the division of `k` by 2. Depending on the value of `k`, this can be an integer or a floating-point number.
- **`math.ceil(k / 2)`**: This will round up the result of `k / 2` to the nearest integer.

### Values of `k`:
- If `k` is 1, `k / 2` is 0.5, and `math.ceil(0.5)` is 1.
- If `k` is an even number greater than 1 (e.g., 2, 4, 6, ...), `k / 2` is an integer, and `math.ceil(k / 2)` is the same integer.
- If `k` is an odd number greater than 1 (e.g., 3, 5, 7, ...), `k / 2` is a floating-point number, and `math.ceil(k / 2)` is the next integer.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

Output: **math.ceil(k / 2) (where k is the integer read from the input)**
