To determine what will be printed by the `print(k // 2 + 1)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the values and conditions of the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- If `k` is 1, it remains 1. Otherwise, `k` retains its original value.
- `k` is greater than \(2 \times n\).

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `k`**: Given that `k` is greater than \(2 \times n\), it implies `k` is a value that is at least \(2n + 1\).
2. **Condition for `k`**: The condition `k > 2n` ensures that `k` is sufficiently large relative to `n`.
3. **Expression `k // 2 + 1`**:
   - `k // 2` is the integer division of `k` by 2, which means it divides `k` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest integer.
   - Adding 1 to `k // 2` shifts the result up by one.

### Calculation:
Since `k` is greater than \(2n\), let's consider the smallest possible value for `k` which is \(2n + 1\):
- If `k = 2n + 1`, then `k // 2` would be \(n\).
- Adding 1 to \(n\) gives \(n + 1\).

Therefore, the expression `k // 2 + 1` will always evaluate to a value greater than `n` and specifically, given the initial state, it will evaluate to \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\), which is the ceiling of \(k/2\).

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `k // 2 + 1`, which is the integer division of `k` by 2, plus 1. Given the constraints, this value is always greater than `n` and specifically \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\).

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is an integer greater than 2 * n)**
