You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it outputs a calculated value based on the conditions: if `k` is 1, it outputs 1; if `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, it outputs the ceiling of `k / 2`; otherwise, it outputs `k // 2 + 1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals (both main and anti-diagonals) contain at least one colored cell.
- The grid has a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals.
- The program needs to handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program handles the input and computes the minimum number of cells to color based on the conditions given:
```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
```
Let's break down the logic:
1. **For \( k = 1 \)**:
   - The program correctly prints 1, as only one cell is needed to cover one diagonal.
2. **For \( k \leq 2n \)**:
   - The program prints \( \lceil k/2 \rceil \). This logic works because:
     - In the best-case scenario, each cell can cover two diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal).
     - If \( k \leq 2n \), we can place cells in such a way that each cell covers two diagonals, and if \( k \) is odd, one more cell is needed.
3. **For \( k > 2n \)**:
   - The program prints \( k//2 + 1 \). This logic works because:
     - If \( k > 2n \), we need to cover more diagonals, so we need to place cells in a way that maximizes the number of diagonals covered per cell.
     - The formula \( k//2 + 1 \) ensures that we cover the required diagonals with the minimum number of cells.
