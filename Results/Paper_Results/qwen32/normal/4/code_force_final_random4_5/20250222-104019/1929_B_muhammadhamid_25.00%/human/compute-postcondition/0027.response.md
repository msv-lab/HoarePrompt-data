Output State: **After all iterations, the loop will have processed `t` test cases, where for each test case, the values of `n` and `k` are read from the input. If `k` is 1, the output for that test case is 1. Otherwise, the output is calculated as `math.ceil(k / 2)` if `k <= 2 * n`, or `k // 2 + 1` if `k > 2 * n`. The variables `n` and `k` are reset for each new test case, and `t` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms: After the loop finishes executing all `t` iterations, it will have printed the result for each test case based on the given conditions for `k` and `n`. The values of `n` and `k` are re-initialized for each test case, and `t` stays the same as the initial number of test cases.
