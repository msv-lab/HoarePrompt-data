Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. If `k` was 1, it remains 1; otherwise, `k` retains its original value. The current value of `k` satisfies either `k <= 2 * n` or `k > 2 * n`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply passes control to the next iteration of the loop it is in, or does nothing if it is not within a loop. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
