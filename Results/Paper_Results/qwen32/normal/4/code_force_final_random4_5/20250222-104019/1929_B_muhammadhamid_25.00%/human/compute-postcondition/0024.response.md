To determine the output of the `print(math.ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). However, `t` does not affect the calculation in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.
2. **`n` and `k`**: These are integers read from the input.
3. **Condition for `k`**:
   - If `k` is 1, it remains 1.
   - Otherwise, `k` retains its original value.
4. **Additional Condition**: The current value of `k` satisfies either \(k \leq 2 \cdot n\) or \(k > 2 \cdot n\).

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(math.ceil(k / 2))
```

- **`math.ceil()`**: This function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the given number.
- **`k / 2`**: This is the division of `k` by 2.

### Determining the Output:
Given the conditions:
- If `k` is 1, `k / 2` is 0.5. Applying `math.ceil(0.5)` results in 1.
- If `k` is any other integer, `k / 2` will be a number that, when passed to `math.ceil()`, will round up to the nearest integer.

Let's consider the different possible values for `k`:
- **If `k` is even**: `k / 2` is an integer, and `math.ceil(k / 2)` will be the same integer.
- **If `k` is odd**: `k / 2` is a decimal number, and `math.ceil(k / 2)` will round it up to the next integer.

### Conclusion:
The output of `print(math.ceil(k / 2))` will be:
- 1 if `k` is 1.
- The smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2` for any other value of `k`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `k`, we can describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **math.ceil(k / 2) (where k is an integer read from the input and satisfies either k <= 2 * n or k > 2 * n)**
