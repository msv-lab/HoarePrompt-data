The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `i` is now less than the length of `a` and has been incremented by 1; `ans` is its previous value concatenated with `b[i-1]`.
