Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string with length at least 2; `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `ans` is a string of length `len(a)` composed of characters from `a` and `b` based on the value of `work` at each step; `i` is `len(a)`; `work` is either `True` or `False`; `counter` is 1; `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1'**

The value of `counter` is reset to 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
