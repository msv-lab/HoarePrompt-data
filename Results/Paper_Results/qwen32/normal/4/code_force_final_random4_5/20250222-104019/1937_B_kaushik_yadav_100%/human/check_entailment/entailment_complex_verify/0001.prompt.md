You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) representing the length of the grid. This is followed by two binary strings of length n, representing the top row (a_{11} a_{12} \ldots a_{1n}) and the bottom row (a_{21} a_{22} \ldots a_{2n}) of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last input string, `b` is the last input string, `ans` is the constructed string based on the loop logic for the last test case, `i` is the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, `j` is `len(a) - 1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `counter` is the final count of consecutive matches or resets based on the conditions for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a new string by alternating between the characters of the two input strings based on specific conditions and prints this string. It then calculates and prints a count of consecutive matching characters between the two strings, starting from the second character of the top string and the first character of the bottom string, resetting the count if a '0' in the top string is followed by a '1' in the bottom string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The grasshopper starts at the top-left cell and can move either right or down. The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by choosing a path and also determine how many paths yield this string.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these steps:
1. Reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Reads the length of the grid `n`.
   - Reads the top row `a` and the bottom row `b`.
   - Constructs the lexicographically smallest string `ans` by iterating through the columns:
     - Initially, it starts in the top row (`work = True`).
     - If it's in the top row, it adds the current cell to `ans` and checks if it's beneficial to switch to the bottom row. It switches if the next cell in the top row is greater than the current cell in the bottom row.
     - If it's in the bottom row, it adds the current cell to `ans` and moves to the next column.
   - Counts the number of paths that yield this string by checking the positions where the top and bottom rows have the same value or where the top row has '0' and the bottom row has '1'.

### Correctness Check
Let's check if this approach correctly determines the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths:
1. **Lexicographically Smallest String**:
   - The program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest string by greedily choosing the smaller value at each step and switching rows when it's beneficial.
   - It ensures that the path taken is always optimal for the lexicographical order.

2. **Number of Paths**:
   - The program counts the number of paths by checking consecutive positions where the top and bottom rows have the same value or where the top row has '0' and the bottom row has '1'.
   - This logic is correct because each such position represents a point where the grasshopper could have taken either path without changing the lexicographical order of the string.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It constructs the lexicographically smallest string and counts the number of paths that yield this string accurately.

Correctness: **True**
