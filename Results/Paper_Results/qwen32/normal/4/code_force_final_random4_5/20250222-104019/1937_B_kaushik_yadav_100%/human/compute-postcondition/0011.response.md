Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `ans` is the first character of `a`; `i` is 0; `work` is True; the condition `work` is True, so the code inside the if statement is being executed.**

Natural language: The variable `ans` now holds the first character of the string `a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
