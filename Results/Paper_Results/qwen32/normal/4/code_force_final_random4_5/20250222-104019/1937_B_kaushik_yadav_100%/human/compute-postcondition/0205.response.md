Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the constructed string based on the loop logic, `i` is at least 2, `work` is either True or False, `counter` is 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, either `a[j + 1]` is not equal to '0' or `b[j]` is not equal to '1', and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
