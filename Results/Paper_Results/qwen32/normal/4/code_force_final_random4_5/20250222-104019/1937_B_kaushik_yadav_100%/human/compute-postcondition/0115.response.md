Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `i` is less than the length of `a` and has been incremented by 1; `ans` is updated to include `a[i]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `i` has been increased by 1, and `ans` now includes the character at the new position `i` in the string `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
