Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for finding the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

#### Test Case:
```
1
4
1011
1001
```

#### Expected Output:
```
10001
3
```

#### Explanation of the Expected Output:
- Starting from the top-left cell (1, 1), the grasshopper has to reach the bottom-right cell (2, 4).
- The lexicographically smallest path is `10001`, which can be achieved by the following paths:
  1. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)
  2. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)
  3. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

#### Actual Output from the Program:
```
10101
1
```

#### Explanation of the Actual Output:
- The program incorrectly follows the path `(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4)`, resulting in the string `10101`.
- It also incorrectly counts the number of paths as `1`, as it does not explore other possible paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string in all cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
