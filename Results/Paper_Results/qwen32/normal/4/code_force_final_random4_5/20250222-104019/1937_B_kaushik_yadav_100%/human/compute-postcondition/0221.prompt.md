Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the grid. This is followed by two binary strings of length `n`, representing the top row (a_{11} a_{12} \ldots a_{1n}) and the bottom row (a_{21} a_{22} \ldots a_{2n}) of the grid, respectively. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The variable `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`. `t` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    ans = ''
    i = 0
    work = True
    while i < len(a):
        if work:
            ans += a[i]
            if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                work = False
            elif i + 1 == len(a):
                ans += b[i]
                break
            else:
                i += 1
        else:
            ans += b[i]
            i += 1
    print(ans)
    counter = 1
    for j in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
            counter += 1
        elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
            counter = 1
        else:
            break
    print(counter)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `ans` is a string of length `len(a)` composed of characters from `a` and `b` based on the value of `work` at each step; `i` is `len(a)`; `work` is either `True` or `False`; `j` is the last index for which the loop condition was satisfied; `counter` reflects the number of consecutive matching characters from `a` and `b` starting from `a[1]` and `b[0]`, with the special case of resetting when `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: - `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases).
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `a` remains the non-empty string.
- `b` remains the new input string.
- `ans` remains the final constructed string based on the conditions described.
- `i` equals the length of `a`.
- `work` is True or False, depending on the last iteration.
- `j` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `counter` reflects the number of consecutive matches before a reset or a break.

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the constructed string based on the loop logic, `i` is the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, `j` is `len(a) - 1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `counter` is the final count of consecutive matches or resets based on the conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
