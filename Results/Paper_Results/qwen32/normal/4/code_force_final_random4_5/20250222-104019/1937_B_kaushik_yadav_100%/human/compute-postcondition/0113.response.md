The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `b` to the string `ans`. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `i` is less than the length of `a`; `ans` is updated to include `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

In simpler terms, the string `ans` now includes the character from `a` at index `i` followed by the character from `b` at the same index `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
