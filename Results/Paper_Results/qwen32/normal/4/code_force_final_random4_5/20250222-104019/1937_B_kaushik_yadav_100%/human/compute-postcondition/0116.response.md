Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `i` is less than the length of `a`. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is updated to include `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is updated to include `a[i]`.**
