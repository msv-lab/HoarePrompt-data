Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is less than the length of `a`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` includes the character `a[i]` and `b[i]` appended to it, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` includes the character `a[i-1]` appended to it.**
