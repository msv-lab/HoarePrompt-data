Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the constructed string based on the loop logic, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, `counter` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the constructed string based on the loop logic, `i` is at least 2, `work` is either True or False. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is 2. Otherwise, `counter` is 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, either `a[j + 1]` is not equal to '0' or `b[j]` is not equal to '1', and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the constructed string based on the loop logic, `i` is at least 2, `work` is either True or False, `j` is 2. If `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`, `counter` is increased by 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with at least 5 characters, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the constructed string based on the loop logic, `i` is at least 2, `work` is either True or False, `j` is 3. If `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, then `counter` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'`, then `counter` is set to 1. In all other cases, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
