The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character `b[i]` to the string `ans`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is less than the length of `a`, `ans` includes the character `a[i]` appended to it and now includes `b[i]` appended to it, `work` is set to `False` if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` remains unchanged.**
