The given code snippet simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `work`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the state of these variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is True**
