The code snippet assigns the value of `input().strip()` to the variable `b`. This means that `b` will hold the value of the next input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is an input integer; `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**
