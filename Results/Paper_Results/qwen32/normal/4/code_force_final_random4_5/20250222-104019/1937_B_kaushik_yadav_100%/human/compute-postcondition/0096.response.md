The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `b` to the string `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially an empty string, and `i` is 0. Therefore, the character at index 0 of `b` is appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `ans` is the first character of `b`; `i` is 0; `work` is False; `j` is the last index for which the loop condition was satisfied; `counter` reflects the number of consecutive matching characters from `a` and `b` starting from `a[1]` and `b[0]`, with the special case of resetting when `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`.**
