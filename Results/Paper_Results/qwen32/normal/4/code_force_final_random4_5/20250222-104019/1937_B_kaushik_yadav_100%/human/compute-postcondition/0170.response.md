The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of the variable `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is initially 0, so after the increment, `i` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` must be a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, `work` is False**.
