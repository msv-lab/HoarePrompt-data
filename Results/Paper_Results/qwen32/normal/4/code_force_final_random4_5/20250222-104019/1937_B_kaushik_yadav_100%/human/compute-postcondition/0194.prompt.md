Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is True
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False and `ans` remains an empty string. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b`, and `work` is either True or False. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` but `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, `ans` remains an empty string, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `work` is True. If `work` is initially False, then `ans` is the first character of `b` and `i` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` is less than `len(a)`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` is `False`. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is updated to include both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to include `a[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1. If `work` is not `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to include `b[i - 1]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `len(a)`, `ans` is updated to include `b[i]`. If `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is set to `False`. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, the loop or if statement breaks after updating `ans` to include `b[i]`. If `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is updated to include `a[i]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
