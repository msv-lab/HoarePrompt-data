The only change in the provided code snippet is that the `counter` variable is incremented by 1. Therefore, the value of `counter` will be updated from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the constructed string based on the loop logic, `i` is at least 2, `work` is either True or False, `counter` is 2, and `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`.**
