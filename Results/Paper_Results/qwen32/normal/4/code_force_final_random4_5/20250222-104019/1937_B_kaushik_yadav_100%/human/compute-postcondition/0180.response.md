Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` must be less than `len(a)`, `ans` is `ans` plus `b[i]`.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` has been updated to include the character at index `i` of the string `b`. All other variables retain their previous values.
