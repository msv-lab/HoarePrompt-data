Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the grid. This is followed by two binary strings of length `n`, representing the top row (a_{11} a_{12} \ldots a_{1n}) and the bottom row (a_{21} a_{22} \ldots a_{2n}) of the grid, respectively. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The variable `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`. `t` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input, which represents the number of test cases.**

In simpler terms: The input description remains the same, and `t` now holds the number of test cases.
