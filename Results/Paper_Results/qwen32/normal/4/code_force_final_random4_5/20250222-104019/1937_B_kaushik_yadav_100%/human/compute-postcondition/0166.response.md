Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` is either 0 or 1, `work` is True, and if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b`. Otherwise, `ans` is the first character of `a` and `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` with `b[i]` not less than `a[i + 1]`.**
