#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) representing the length of the grid. This is followed by two binary strings of length n, representing the top row (a_{11} a_{12} \ldots a_{1n}) and the bottom row (a_{21} a_{22} \ldots a_{2n}) of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        ans = ''
        
        i = 0
        
        work = True
        
        while i < len(a):
            if work:
                ans += a[i]
                if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                    work = False
                elif i + 1 == len(a):
                    ans += b[i]
                    break
                else:
                    i += 1
            else:
                ans += b[i]
                i += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
        counter = 1
        
        for j in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
                counter += 1
            elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
                counter = 1
            else:
                break
        
        print(counter)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last input string, `b` is the last input string, `ans` is the constructed string based on the loop logic for the last test case, `i` is the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False, `j` is `len(a) - 1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `counter` is the final count of consecutive matches or resets based on the conditions for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a new string by alternating between the characters of the two input strings based on specific conditions and prints this string. It then calculates and prints a count of consecutive matching characters between the two strings, starting from the second character of the top string and the first character of the bottom string, resetting the count if a '0' in the top string is followed by a '1' in the bottom string.
