The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `j` is the previous value of `j` plus 1. All other conditions and values remain the same as per the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input; `i` is 1; `j` is the index where `b[j] == a[1]` (if a match is found) plus 1; `k` is increased by 1.**
