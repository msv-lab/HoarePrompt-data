Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input with `b[0]` not equal to `a[0]`; `k` is 0; `j` is 1**.

The value of `j` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
