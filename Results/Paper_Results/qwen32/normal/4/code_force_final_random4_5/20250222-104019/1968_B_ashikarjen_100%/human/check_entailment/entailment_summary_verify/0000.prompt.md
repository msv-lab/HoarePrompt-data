You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Output

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
    return



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two integers `n` and `m`, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It counts the maximum number of characters from string `a` that can be found in string `b` in the specified order and prints this count. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \). Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes \( k \) to 0 and \( j \) to 0. \( k \) keeps track of the length of the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \), and \( j \) is the current position in string \( b \).

2. **Iterating through \( a \)**: The program iterates through each character in string \( a \) using a for loop.

3. **Finding the character in \( b \)**: For each character \( a[i] \) in string \( a \), the program uses a while loop to find the first occurrence of \( a[i] \) in string \( b \) starting from position \( j \).

4. **Updating \( k \) and \( j \)**: If the character \( a[i] \) is found in \( b \) (i.e., \( j < m \)), \( k \) is incremented by 1, and \( j \) is moved to the next position after the found character in \( b \). If \( a[i] \) is not found in \( b \), the loop breaks, and the current value of \( k \) is printed.

5. **Printing the result**: After processing all characters in \( a \), the program prints the value of \( k \), which represents the maximum length of the prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).

The program handles all edge cases:
- If \( a \) is empty, \( k \) remains 0, which is correct.
- If \( b \) is empty, \( k \) remains 0, which is correct.
- If \( a \) is not a subsequence of \( b \) at all, \( k \) will be 0, which is correct.
- If \( a \) is a complete subsequence of \( b \), \( k \) will be the length of \( a \), which is correct.

The program efficiently handles the constraints given in the problem description, and it correctly processes each test case as demonstrated by the examples provided. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
