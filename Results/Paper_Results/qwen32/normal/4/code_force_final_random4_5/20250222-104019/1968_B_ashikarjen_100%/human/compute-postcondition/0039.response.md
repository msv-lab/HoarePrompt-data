The code snippet increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` was 2, so after the increment, `j` will be 3. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5 and `m` must be greater than 2; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input such that `b[1]` is not equal to `a[1]` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`; `i` is 1; `j` is 3**
