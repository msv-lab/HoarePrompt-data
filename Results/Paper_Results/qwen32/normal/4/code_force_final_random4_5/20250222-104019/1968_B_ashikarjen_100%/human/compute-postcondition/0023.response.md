The code snippet provided increments the variable `j` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` starts at 1. After the increment, `j` becomes 2. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5 and `m` must be at least 2; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length m read from the input and `b[1]` must not be equal to `a[0]`; `k` is 1 if `j` was less than `m` and has been incremented by 1, otherwise `k` is 0; `j` is 2; `i` is 0**.
