The code snippet reads a new input value and assigns it to the variable `b`. This new value overwrites the previous value of `b`, which was a binary string of length `m`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input.**
