Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It performs operations based on predefined test cases involving integers `t`, `n`, `m_1`, `m_2`, `p_i`, and `s_i`. The function returns 0 in three different cases and returns the result of the product of all `nums_left` values modulo `MOD` in the fourth case, where `nums_left` is determined by the value of `M2`.**
