The code `cur -= 1` decrements the value of the variable `cur` by 1. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `cur`, so we will denote the new value of `cur` as `cur - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N` is an integer such that 2 < `N` <= 2 * 10^5; `M1` is an integer such that 1 <= `M1` <= `N`; `M2` is an integer such that 1 <= `M2` <= `N`; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N`; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N`; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input; `nums_left` is `N - 4`; `i` is `N - 2`; `cur` is `cur - 1`.**
