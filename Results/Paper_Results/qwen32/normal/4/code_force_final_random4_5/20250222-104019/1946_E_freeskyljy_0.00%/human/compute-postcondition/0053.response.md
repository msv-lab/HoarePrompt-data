The code snippet `ans = ans * nums_left % MOD` updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. Given that `nums_left` is -2, the value of `ans` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged; `nums_left` is -2; `M2` is greater than 1; `cur` is either 1 or 2; `i` is less than `N`; `ans` is updated to `(ans * -2) % MOD`.**
