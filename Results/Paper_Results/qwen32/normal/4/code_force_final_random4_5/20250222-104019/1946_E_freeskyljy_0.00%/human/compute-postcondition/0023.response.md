The code snippet `nums_left -= 1` decrements the value of `nums_left` by 1. Given the initial state, `nums_left` is initially set to `N - 2`. After executing the code, `nums_left` will be `N - 3`.

The other variables remain unchanged by this operation. Specifically, `t`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, `R`, `ans`, `cur`, and `i` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N` is an integer such that `2 < N <= 2 * 10^5`; `M1` is an integer such that 1 <= `M1` <= `N`; `M2` is an integer such that 1 <= `M2` <= `N`; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N`; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N`; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input; `ans` is assigned the value of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` if `i` equals `L[cur]`, otherwise `ans` is assigned the value of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * nums_left % MOD`; `M1` is greater than 1 and `cur` is `M1 - 2` if `i` equals `L[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is `M1 - 3`; `nums_left` is `N - 3`; `i` is `N - 1`.**
