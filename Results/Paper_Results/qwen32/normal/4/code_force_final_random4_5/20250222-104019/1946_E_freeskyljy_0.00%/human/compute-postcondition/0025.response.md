To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `i > 1`. The current state provided is:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4
- `N` is an integer such that `2 < N <= 2 * 10^5`
- `M1` is an integer such that 1 <= `M1` <= `N`
- `M2` is an integer such that 1 <= `M2` <= `N`
- `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N`
- `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N`
- `L` is a list of integers read from the input
- `R` is a list of integers read from the input
- `ans` is assigned the value of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` if `i` equals `L[cur]`, otherwise `ans` is assigned the value of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * nums_left % MOD`
- `M1` is greater than 1 and `cur` is `M1 - 2` if `i` equals `L[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is `M1 - 3`
- `nums_left` is `N - 3`
- `i` is `N - 2`

The loop condition is `i > 1`. Since `i` is currently `N - 2` and `N` is greater than `2`, `i` is certainly greater than `1`. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments to the variables in the loop head.

Thus, the state remains the same:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N` is an integer such that `2 < N <= 2 * 10^5`; `M1` is an integer such that 1 <= `M1` <= `N`; `M2` is an integer such that 1 <= `M2` <= `N`; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N`; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N`; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input; `ans` is assigned the value of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` if `i` equals `L[cur]`, otherwise `ans` is assigned the value of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * nums_left % MOD`; `M1` is greater than 1 and `cur` is `M1 - 2` if `i` equals `L[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is `M1 - 3`; `nums_left` is `N - 3`; `i` is `N - 2`**
