Output State: **The program returns the result of the product of all `nums_left` values modulo `MOD` after the loop completes. If `M2` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `R[0] - N`, otherwise `nums_left` remains -1.**

In simple terms: The program returns `ans`, which is the product of all `nums_left` values taken modulo `MOD` after a loop finishes executing. If `M2` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is calculated as `R[0] - N`. If `M2` is not greater than 1, `nums_left` is -1.
