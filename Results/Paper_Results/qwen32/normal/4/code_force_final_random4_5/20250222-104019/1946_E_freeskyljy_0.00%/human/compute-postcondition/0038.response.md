Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. For each test case, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers with constraints 1 <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= `M1` <= `N`, and 1 <= `M2` <= `N`. The sequences `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}` and `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}` are distinct integers in increasing order within the range 1 to `N`. The lists `L` and `R` contain integers read from the input, with the last element of `L` equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is `N`. At least one of the following conditions is true: `M1` is 1, `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`. If `M1` > 1, `i` is set to 1, `nums_left` is set to 1, `cur` is set to -1 (if all elements of `L` are encountered, otherwise it is the index of the first `L` element not encountered), and `ans` is the final computed value. If `M1` is not greater than 1, `cur` remains `M1 - 2`.**
