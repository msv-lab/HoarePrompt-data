The given code snippet updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4
- `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged
- `nums_left` is -3
- `M2` is greater than 1
- `i` is incremented by 1 such that `i + 1 < N`

The code updates `ans` as `ans * nums_left % MOD`. Since `nums_left` is -3, `ans` will be updated to `ans * (-3) % MOD`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged; `nums_left` is -3; `M2` is greater than 1; `i` is incremented by 1 such that `i + 1 < N`; `ans` is `ans * (-3) % MOD`.**
