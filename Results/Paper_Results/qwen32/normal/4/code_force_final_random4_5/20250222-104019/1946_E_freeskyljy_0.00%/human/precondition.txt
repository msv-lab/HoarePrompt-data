Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), two integers m_1 and m_2 (1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n), a list of m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{m_1} (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing the indices of the prefix maximums, and a list of m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{m_2} (1 ≤ s_i ≤ n) representing the indices of the suffix maximums. The sum of the values of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
