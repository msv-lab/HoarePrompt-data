The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is the element at index `i` in `l`; `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in `l`; `j` is set to 1; `i` must be less than `n - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
