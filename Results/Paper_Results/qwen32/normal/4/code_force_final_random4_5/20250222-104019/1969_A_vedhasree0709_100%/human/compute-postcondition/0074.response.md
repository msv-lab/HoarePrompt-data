The code `p = l[i]` assigns the value at index `i` of the list `l` to the variable `p`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `p` will be assigned the value of the first element in the list `l`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `t` and `n` must be such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `p` is the first element of `l`.**
