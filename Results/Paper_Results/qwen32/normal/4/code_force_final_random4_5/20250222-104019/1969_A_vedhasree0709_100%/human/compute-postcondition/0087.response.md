Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `p` is the element at index 1 of `l`, and `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of `l`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
