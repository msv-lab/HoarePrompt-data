The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 2. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.

Since `i` is currently 2, `n` must be at least 3 to ensure that `i` (which is 2) is less than or equal to `n - 1` (which would be 2 if `n` is 3, 3 if `n` is 4, and so on).

No other states need to be adjusted as per the requirement to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head.

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1 if `q` equals 2, otherwise `j` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `p` is the element at index 1 of `l`, and `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of `l`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
