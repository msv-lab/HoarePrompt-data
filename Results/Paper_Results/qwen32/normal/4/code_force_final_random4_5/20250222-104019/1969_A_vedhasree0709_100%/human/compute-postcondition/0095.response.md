Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 3, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `p` is the element at index 2 of `l`, `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of `l`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `i`, `j`, `n`, `l`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
