The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Since `n` is an input integer, it is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
