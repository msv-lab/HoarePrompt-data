Output State: **`a` remains the list returned by `func_1(int)`, `n` and `q` remain the values returned by `func_1(int)` where `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)` such that `1 <= l < r <= n`, `x` is `[0] + [cumulative XOR results]` where each element is the XOR of the previous element in `x` with the next element in `a`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique XOR result from `x`, and each value is a list of indices in `x` where that XOR result occurs, `lower` is yet to be recalculated based on the new `l` and `r`, `upper` is yet to be recalculated based on the new `l` and `r`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `inds`, `lower`, `upper`, and does not change the fact that `lower` and `upper` need to be recalculated. The only change is that `i` is incremented by 1.
