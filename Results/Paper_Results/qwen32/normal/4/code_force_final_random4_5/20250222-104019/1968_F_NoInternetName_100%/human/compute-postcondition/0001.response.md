The code snippet `a = list(func_1(int))` reassigns the variable `a` to be a list of integers returned by the function `func_1` when called with an integer argument. This means the original list `a` (which was a list of `n` integers) is replaced by the new list returned by `func_1`.

The initial state mentions that `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, but since the function `func_1` is called again in the code snippet, the new value of `a` will be the list returned by this new call to `func_1`. The values of `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code, which they are not in this case.

Output State: **`a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)`, `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of a subarray such that 1 <= l < r <= n.**
