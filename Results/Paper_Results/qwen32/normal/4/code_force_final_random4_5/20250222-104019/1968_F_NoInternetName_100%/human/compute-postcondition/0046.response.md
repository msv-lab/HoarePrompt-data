The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides a detailed description of various variables and objects, but the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables or objects. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Here is the breakdown:
- The variable `a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)`.
- The variables `n` and `q` are values returned by `func_1(int)` with the condition that `q` is greater than 0.
- The variables `l` and `r` are new values returned by `func_1(int)` such that `1 <= l < r <= n`.
- The variable `x` is a list that starts with `0` and continues with cumulative XOR results from the elements of `a`.
- The variable `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique XOR result from `x`, and each value is a list of indices in `x` where that XOR result occurs.
- The variables `lower` and `upper` are recalculated based on the new `l` and `r` values.
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1.
- There are additional conditions based on whether `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, but these do not affect the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is `print('Yes')`, the output is simply the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
