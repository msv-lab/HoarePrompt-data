Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, and `r`. `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range [0, 2^30), and `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of a subarray such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The function processes `q` queries on the array `a` and returns the result of each query, which is the sum of the elements in the subarray from index `l` to `r` (inclusive).**
