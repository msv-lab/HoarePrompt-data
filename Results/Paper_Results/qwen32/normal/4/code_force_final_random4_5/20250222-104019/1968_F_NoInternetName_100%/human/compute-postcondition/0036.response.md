To determine the output of the `print('Yes')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the context in which the `print` statement is placed.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `a` is a list returned by `func_1(int)`.
- `n` and `q` are values returned by `func_1(int)`, with `q` being greater than 0.
- `l` and `r` are new values returned by `func_1(int)`, such that `1 <= l < r <= n`.
- `x` is a list where `x[0]` is 0, and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the previous element in `x` with the next element in `a`.
- `inds` is a dictionary where each key is a unique XOR result from `x`, and each value is a list of indices in `x` where that XOR result occurs.
- `lower` is assigned the value of the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or 0 if no such index exists.
- `upper` is assigned the value of the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
- If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the loop continues to the next iteration.
- Otherwise, `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

The `print('Yes')` statement is executed after all these assignments and conditions are met. The value to be printed is explicitly 'Yes', and there are no variables or conditions affecting the string 'Yes' itself.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply:

Output: **Yes**
