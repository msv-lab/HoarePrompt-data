### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if a subarray of a given array can be split into more than one segment such that the bitwise XOR of each segment is equal. The solution leverages cumulative XOR values and binary search to efficiently answer multiple queries.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:

1. **Cumulative XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the cumulative XOR values of the array and stores them in the list `x`. For example, if the array is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]`, the cumulative XOR list `x` would be `[0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1]`.
   - This cumulative XOR list allows us to quickly determine the XOR of any subarray. Specifically, the XOR of the subarray from index `l-1` to `r` is `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.

2. **Index Mapping**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `inds` to map each cumulative XOR value to the list of indices where that value occurs.
   - This mapping enables quick lookups to find indices where a particular cumulative XOR value appears.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the cumulative XOR values at the start and end of the subarray are equal (`x[l-1] == x[r]`). If they are, the subarray is trivially interesting because it can be split into two parts with equal XOR.
   - If the cumulative XOR values are not equal, the program uses binary search (via `func_2` and `func_4`) to find the appropriate indices in the `inds` dictionary to determine if the subarray can be split into segments with equal XOR.
   - Specifically, it finds the largest index `lower` in the list of indices for `x[r]` that is less than `l` and the smallest index `upper` in the list of indices for `x[l-1]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it means there is a valid split point within the subarray, and the subarray is interesting.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray can be split into segments with equal XOR values. It efficiently handles multiple queries using cumulative XOR values and binary search, ensuring it can process the maximum input size within the given constraints.

Thus, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
