The code appends the index `len(x) - 1` to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. Given that `x` is `[0, 0 ^ i]`, the last element of `x` is `0 ^ i`. Since `0 ^ any_value` is `any_value`, `x[-1]` is `i`. Therefore, the index `len(x) - 1` which is `1` is appended to `inds[i]`.

Thus, `inds[i]` will now be `[0, 1]` because initially `inds[0]` was `[0]` and now `inds[i]` (which is `inds[0 ^ i]` and `i` is `0 ^ i`) gets the new index `1` appended to it.

Output State: **`a` is a list returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least one element, `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of a subarray such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is `[0, 0 ^ i]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 1]` and `inds[i]` is `[0, 1]`**.
