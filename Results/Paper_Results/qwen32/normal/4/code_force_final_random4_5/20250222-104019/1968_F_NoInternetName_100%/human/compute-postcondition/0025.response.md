Based on the provided initial state, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables involved in the print statement. The print statement is:

```python
print('Yes')
```

The key points to consider from the initial state are:

1. `a` is a list returned by `func_1(int)`.
2. `n` and `q` are values returned by `func_1(int)`, with `q` being greater than 0.
3. `l` and `r` are new values returned by `func_1(int)` such that `1 <= l < r <= n`.
4. `x` is a list constructed as `[0] + [cumulative XOR results]`, where each cumulative XOR result is the XOR of the previous element in `x` with the next element in `a`.
5. `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique XOR result from `x`, and each value is a list of indices in `x` where that XOR result occurs.
6. `lower` is assigned the value of `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`.
7. `upper` is assigned the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`.
8. The current value of `upper` is greater than the current value of `lower`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. There are no variables or conditions in the print statement itself that would change the output based on the provided initial state. The conditions and calculations described in the initial state are used to determine the values of `lower` and `upper`, but they do not affect the content of the print statement.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **Yes**
