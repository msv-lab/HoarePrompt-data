The code snippet `s = i ^ check` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the variable `i` and the variable `check`, and assigns the result to the variable `s`. The values of `times`, `n`, `data`, `dic`, `ans`, and `check` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we can't determine its specific value. However, the operation `i ^ check` will produce a specific value once `i` is known. Since `check` is given as 2147483647, the result `s` will be `i` XOR 2147483647.

Output State: **`times` is an integer such that 1 <= `times` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least 1 element; `dic` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is 0; `check` is 2147483647; `s` is `i` XOR 2147483647.**
