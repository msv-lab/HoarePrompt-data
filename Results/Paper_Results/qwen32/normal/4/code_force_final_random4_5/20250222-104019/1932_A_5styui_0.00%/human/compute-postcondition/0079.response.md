Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is greater than or equal to 1; `d` is the input integer; `b` is a non-empty string; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `s` is 1; `j` is the index of the character where the loop terminates. The character at index `j` in `b` is '@'.**

In natural language: The value of `s` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
