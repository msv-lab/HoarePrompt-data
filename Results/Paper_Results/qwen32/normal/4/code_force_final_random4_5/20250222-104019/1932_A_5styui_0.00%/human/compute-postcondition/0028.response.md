Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.', `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is `j + 1`, `s` is `s + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is incremented by 1, and the value of `j` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
