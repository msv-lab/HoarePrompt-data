Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.', `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `d` is the input integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables remain unchanged except for the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
