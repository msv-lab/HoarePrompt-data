Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is greater than or equal to 1; `d` is the input integer; `s` is 1; `b` is a non-empty input string; `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `b[j]` is equal to '@'**

In this output state, the variable `s` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
