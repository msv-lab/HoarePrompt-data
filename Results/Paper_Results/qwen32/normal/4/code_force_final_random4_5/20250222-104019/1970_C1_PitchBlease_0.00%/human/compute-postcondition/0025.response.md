The only variable in the loop head is `neighbor`, which is used to iterate over the neighbors of `current` in the `tree` dictionary. To ensure that the loop can execute, the `current` node must have at least one neighbor in the `tree` dictionary.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state such that `current` has at least one neighbor. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `current` is `next_node` and it must have at least one neighbor in the `tree` dictionary for the loop to execute.
2. The `tree` dictionary must contain `current` as a key and its value must be a list with at least one element (i.e., at least one neighbor).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `current` (which is `next_node`) has at least one neighbor in the `tree` dictionary.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i and `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor; `queue` is a deque that no longer contains `next_node`; `visited` is a set containing all nodes that are reachable from `start` including `next_node`; `current` is `next_node`. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns `dist`, which is the next value in the deque after `next_node`. Otherwise, no return value is specified and the state of `dist` remains as the next value in the deque after `next_node`.**
