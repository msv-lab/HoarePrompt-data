Functionality: **The function `bfs` accepts two integer parameters `start` and `target`, representing nodes in a tree, and a `tree` which is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node `i`. The function performs a breadth-first search to determine the shortest distance from `start` to `target`. If `start` is equal to `target`, the function returns `0`. If `target` is reachable from `start`, the function returns the shortest distance `dist` from `start` to `target`. If `target` is not reachable, the function returns `-1`.**
