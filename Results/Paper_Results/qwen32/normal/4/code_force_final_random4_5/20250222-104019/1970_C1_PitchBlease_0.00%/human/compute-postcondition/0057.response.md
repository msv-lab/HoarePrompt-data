Output State: **`start` and `target` remain unchanged, `tree` remains unchanged, `queue` is empty, `visited` contains all nodes that are reachable from `start`, `current` is the last node processed, and `dist` is the shortest distance from `start` to `target` if `target` is reachable; otherwise, `dist` reflects the distance to the last node processed.**

In natural language, after all iterations, the `queue` will be empty because all nodes that can be reached from `start` have been processed. The `visited` set will include all nodes that are reachable from `start`, and `dist` will represent the shortest distance from `start` to `target` if `target` is reachable. If `target` is not reachable, `dist` will reflect the distance to the last node processed. The `start` and `target` values, as well as the `tree` structure, remain unchanged throughout the process.
