Output State: **`start` and `target` remain unchanged, `tree` remains unchanged, `queue` has one more node which is `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `visited` contains all nodes that are reachable from `start` including `neighbor`, `current` is a key in `tree` and `tree[current]` is a non-empty list, `dist` is the distance associated with the `current` node if it was part of a tuple, otherwise it is the node itself, and `neighbor` is in `visited`.**

Explanation: The `queue` now includes an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, reflecting the updated distance to the `neighbor` node. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state descriptions.
