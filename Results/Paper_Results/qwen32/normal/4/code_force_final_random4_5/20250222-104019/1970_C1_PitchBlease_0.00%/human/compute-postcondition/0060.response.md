Functionality: **The function `bfs` determines the shortest distance from a starting node to a target node in a tree. It accepts two integer parameters, `start` and `target`, representing the nodes, and a `tree` which is a dictionary or list of lists representing the tree structure. If the `start` node is the same as the `target` node, it returns `0`. If the `target` is reachable from the `start`, it returns the shortest distance. If the `target` is not reachable, it returns `-1`.**
