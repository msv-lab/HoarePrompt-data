Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree; `tree` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i; `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)` representing the starting node and the initial distance of 0; `visited` is a set containing the `start` node.
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i; `queue` is an empty deque; `visited` is a set containing all nodes that are reachable from `start`; `current` is the last node processed before the queue became empty; `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`; `current` is not necessarily equal to `target` unless the loop specifically terminates when `current` equals `target`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: - `start` and `target` remain unchanged as they are initial conditions.
- `tree` remains unchanged as it is the input structure defining the graph.
- `queue` will be empty because all reachable nodes from `start` will have been processed.
- `visited` will contain all nodes that are reachable from `start`, including `start` itself and `target` if it is reachable.
- `current` will be the last node processed, which could be any node in `visited` depending on the order of processing.
- `dist` will be the shortest distance from `start` to `target` if `target` is reachable, otherwise, it will be the distance to the last processed node.

In natural language, after all iterations, the `queue` will be empty as all nodes that can be reached from `start` have been processed. The `visited` set will include all nodes reachable from `start`, and `dist` will represent the shortest distance from `start` to `target` if `target` is reachable. If `target` is not reachable, `dist` will reflect the distance to the last node processed.

Output State:
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start` and `target` remain unchanged, `tree` remains unchanged, `queue` is empty, `visited` contains all nodes that are reachable from `start`, `current` is the last node processed, and `dist` is the distance associated with the last node processed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
