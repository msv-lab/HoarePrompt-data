Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

# Annotated Functions:
from collections import deque, defaultdict

(n, t) = map(int, input().split())
edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
starts = list(map(int, input().split()))
start = starts[0]
print(func_1(n, edges, start))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge in the tree with 1 <= u, v <= n, and start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `tree` is a defaultdict where each key `u` is associated with a list of vertices `v` that are directly connected to `u` by an edge in the tree, representing the adjacency list of the tree.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns 'Hermione'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges in the tree, and an integer `start` representing the starting node. It returns 'Ron' if the shortest distance from the starting node to at least one of the leaves in the tree is even, and 'Hermione' if the shortest distance to both leaves is odd.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. tree is a dictionary (or list of lists) where tree[i] contains the neighbors of node i.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: `start` and `target` remain unchanged, `tree` remains unchanged, `queue` is empty, `visited` contains all nodes that are reachable from `start`, `current` is the last node processed, and `dist` is the shortest distance from `start` to `target` if `target` is reachable; otherwise, `dist` reflects the distance to the last node processed.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `bfs` determines the shortest distance from a starting node to a target node in a tree. It accepts two integer parameters, `start` and `target`, representing the nodes, and a `tree` which is a dictionary or list of lists representing the tree structure. If the `start` node is the same as the `target` node, it returns `0`. If the `target` is reachable from the `start`, it returns the shortest distance. If the `target` is not reachable, it returns `-1`.
