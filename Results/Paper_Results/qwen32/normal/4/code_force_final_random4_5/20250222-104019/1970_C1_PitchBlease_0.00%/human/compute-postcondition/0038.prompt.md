Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i; `queue` is a deque that no longer contains `next_node`; `visited` is a set containing all nodes that are reachable from `start` including `next_node`; `current` is `next_node`. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns `dist`, which is the next value in the deque after `next_node`. Otherwise, no return value is specified and the state of `dist` remains as the next value in the deque after `next_node`.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i and `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor; `queue` is a deque. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, then `queue` contains all previous elements plus `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` contains all nodes that are reachable from `start` including `next_node` and `neighbor`. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns `dist`, which is the next value in the deque after `next_node`. Otherwise, no return value is specified and the state of `dist` remains as the next value in the deque after `next_node`. If `neighbor` is already in `visited`, then `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged. `current` is `next_node`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i and `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor; `queue` is a deque that includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`; `visited` contains all nodes that are reachable from `start` including `next_node` and `neighbor` and now also includes `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`; `current` is `next_node`; `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]` that has not been processed yet.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i and `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor; `queue` is a deque that includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`; `visited` contains all nodes that are reachable from `start` including `next_node` and `neighbor` and now also includes `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`; `current` is `next_node`; `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]` that has not been processed yet. If `neighbor` was not in `visited`, it has been added to `visited` and `(neighbor, dist + 1)` has been added to `queue`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
