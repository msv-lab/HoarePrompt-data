Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `i` is `n - 2`, `counter` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `counter` has increased by 1, while the values of `n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `i` remain unchanged.
