The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 0, and the characters at index `i` of `s1` and `s2` are equal still holds, except that `i` is now `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, and the characters at index `i` of `s1` and `s2` are equal**
