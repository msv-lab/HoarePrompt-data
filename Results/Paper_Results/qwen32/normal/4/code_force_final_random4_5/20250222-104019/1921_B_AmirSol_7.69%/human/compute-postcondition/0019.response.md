The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state where `i` is `n - 2`, after the increment, `i` becomes `n - 1`. The other variables (`n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `counter`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `i` is `n - 1`, `counter` is increased by 1.**
