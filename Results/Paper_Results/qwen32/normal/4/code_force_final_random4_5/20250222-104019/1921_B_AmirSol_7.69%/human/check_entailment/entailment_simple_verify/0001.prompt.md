You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to transform the initial state of cats in boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`) using the minimum number of operations. The allowed operations are:
1. Adding a cat to a box that does not contain a cat.
2. Removing a cat from a box that contains a cat.
3. Moving a cat from a box that contains a cat to a box that does not contain a cat.

The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve the desired state from the initial state.

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state `s1`, and the desired state `s2`. It then calls the function `func_1` to compute the minimum number of operations required.

The function `func_1` iterates through the boxes and counts the number of mismatches between `s1` and `s2`. If a mismatch is found, it checks if the next box also has a mismatch and if the current and next boxes have different states in `s1`. If so, it counts this as one operation and skips the next box. Otherwise, it counts this as one operation and moves to the next box.

### Correctness Check

Let's consider the logic of the function `func_1`:
- The function counts mismatches between `s1` and `s2`.
- If two consecutive boxes have mismatches and different states in `s1`, it considers this as one operation (a swap).
- Otherwise, it considers each mismatch as one operation (either adding/removing a cat).

However, there is a flaw in the logic:
- The function does not handle the case where we can move a cat from a box with a mismatch to a box with a mismatch in a more optimal way.
- The function does not consider the possibility of moving cats in a way that minimizes the total number of operations.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the first test case from the example:
- `s1 = "10010"`
- `s2 = "00001"`

The function will count the mismatches as follows:
1. `s1[0] != s2[0]` (mismatch, `s1[0] = 1`, `s2[0] = 0`)
2. `s1[3] != s2[3]` (mismatch, `s1[3] = 1`, `s2[3] = 0`)
3. `s1[4] != s2[4]` (mismatch, `s1[4] = 0`, `s2[4] = 1`)

The function will count this as 3 operations, but the optimal solution is 2 operations:
1. Move the cat from box 1 to box 5.
2. Remove the cat from box 4.

Thus, the function does not always provide the minimum number of operations.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because it does not always compute the minimum number of operations required to transform `s1` to `s2`.
