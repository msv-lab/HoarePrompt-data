Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `itest` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, then the condition holds as specified in the if part. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`, as specified in the else part.**
