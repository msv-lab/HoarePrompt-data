Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `itest` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer. If `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, the condition holds true, otherwise, it does not. The values of `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged regardless of the condition.**
