The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides several variables (`t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, `k`) and their relationships, but these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of these variables and will output the string `'Yes'` as it is.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k`, and their constraints.
2. The `print` statement is `print('Yes')`, which directly outputs the string `'Yes'`.
3. Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, or `k`, their values do not affect the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
