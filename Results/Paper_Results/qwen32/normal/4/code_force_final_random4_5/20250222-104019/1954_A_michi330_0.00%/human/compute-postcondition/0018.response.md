To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes each test case.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` and then checks the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`. Based on this condition, it prints either 'NO' or 'YES'.

After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` will reflect the values from the last test case processed. The loop variable `itest` will be equal to `t` after the loop finishes.

### Output State:
- `t` remains the same as the initial input value.
- `itest` will be equal to `t` after the loop finishes.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` will hold the values from the last test case.

### Natural Language Description:
The output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is that `t` retains its initial value, representing the total number of test cases. The loop variable `itest` will be equal to `t`, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` will hold the values from the last test case processed.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `itest` equals `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` hold the values from the last test case.**
