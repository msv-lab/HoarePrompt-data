The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It prints 'NO' if `n` is less than or equal to `k` or if the difference between `n` and the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than `k`. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without altering the input values.
