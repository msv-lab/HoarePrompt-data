The given initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, `k`), but the `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'NO'`. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state are used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
