The provided Python code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means that the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are overwritten by the new input values. The other variables (`t` and `itest`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `itest` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer.**

In natural language: The values of `t` and `itest` remain the same. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the first, second, and third integers provided in the input, respectively.
