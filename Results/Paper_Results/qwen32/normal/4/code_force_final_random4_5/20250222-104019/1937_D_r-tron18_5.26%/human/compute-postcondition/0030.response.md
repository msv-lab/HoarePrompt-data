To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression `zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` given the initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` is `[0, n]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `el` is `s1[n - 1]`, and `el` is not equal to '>'.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `1`.
- `zr` is greater than `ol`.

The expression involves a function `func_1` which is not defined in the initial state. However, we can make some assumptions based on the context and typical usage in such problems. `func_1` is likely a binary search function or a function that finds the index of a certain value in a sorted list.

Given `suffZero` is `[0, n]`, and assuming `func_1` is a binary search function that returns the index of the first element not less than the given value, we can analyze the function calls:

1. `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)`: Since `ol` is `totalOne`, and `suffZero` is `[0, n]`, this call will return `1` if `ol + 1 > 0` and `ol + 1 <= n`. Otherwise, it might return `1` as well because `n` is the upper bound.
2. `func_1(suffZero, 1)`: This call will return `1` because `1` is in the list `[0, n]`.

Let's assume `ol + 1 <= n` for the sake of calculation. Then:
- `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` returns `1`.
- `func_1(suffZero, 1)` returns `1`.

Now we can compute `zeroInd`:
```
zeroInd = 2 * 1 - 1 = 1
```

Thus, the value of `zeroInd` is `1`.

The other variables remain unchanged except for `zeroInd` which is newly assigned a value.
