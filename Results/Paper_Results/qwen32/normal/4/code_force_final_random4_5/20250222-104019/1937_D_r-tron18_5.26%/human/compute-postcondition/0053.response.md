Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, n - 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n, 2n - 1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` and `n-2` where `ans[n-2]` is calculated based on the condition `ol <= zr`; `i` is `n - 2`; `el` is `s1[n - 2]`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `zr` is `2`; `zeroInd` is `n - 1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `zeroInd` is `3n - 1`; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`; `ans[n-2]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans[n-2]` has been updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
