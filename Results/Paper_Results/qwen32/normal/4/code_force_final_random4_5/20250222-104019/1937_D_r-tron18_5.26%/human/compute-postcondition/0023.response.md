The code snippet appends a new value to the `suffZero` list. The new value is calculated as the last element of `suffZero` plus `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, the new value appended to `suffZero` is `suffZero[-1] + (n - 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `suffZero[-1] + n`.

The initial state of `suffZero` is `[0]`. Therefore, the new value appended will be `0 + n`, which is `n`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0; `suffZero` is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `i` is `n - 1`; `el` is `s1[n - 1]`, and `el` is not equal to '>'**
