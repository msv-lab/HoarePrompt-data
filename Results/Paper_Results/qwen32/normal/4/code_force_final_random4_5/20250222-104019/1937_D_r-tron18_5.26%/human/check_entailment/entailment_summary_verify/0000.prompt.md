You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate
#Function 1:
def func_1(arr, times):
    l = len(arr)
    return arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]

#Function 2:
def func_2(s1, n):
    pre = [i + 1 for (i, el) in enumerate(s1) if el == '>']
    totalOne = len(pre)
    preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))
    suffZero = [0]
    ans = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        el = s1[i]
        if el == '>':
            (ol, zr) = (totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1)
            if ol <= zr:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
                oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
                oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
                fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
            preOne.pop()
            totalOne -= 1
        else:
            suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
            (ol, zr) = (totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1)
            if zr <= ol:
                zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]

                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and computes a list of integers `ans` where each element is derived based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in the string. The function prints the list `ans` after processing the string.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly implements the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- A grid of length `n` contains characters `<` or `>`.
- A pinball placed on the `i-th` cell moves according to the character at that cell.
- The character is inverted after the pinball moves.
- The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.
- For each cell `i` from `1` to `n`, determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

### Program Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(arr, times)`: This function seems to be used for calculating some offset based on the accumulated values in `arr` and the number of times.
2. `func_2(s1, n)`: This function processes the string `s1` and computes the number of seconds for each pinball to leave the grid.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Complexity and Correctness**: The code uses complex logic with accumulations and offsets, which might be challenging to verify without a thorough understanding of the underlying mathematics.
2. **Edge Cases**: The code does not explicitly handle edge cases like:
   - A grid with all `<` or all `>`.
   - Grids of length 1.
   - Grids with alternating characters.

### Testing with Example Inputs:
Let's test the code with the provided example inputs to see if it produces the correct output.

# Function to simulate the input
def simulate_input(data):
    input_lines = data.split('\n')
    def input_func():
        return input_lines.pop(0)
    return input_func

# Redirecting input

                if ol <= zr:
                    zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
                    oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
                    ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
                else:
                    zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
                    oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)

                    ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
                preOne.pop()
                totalOne -= 1
            else:
                suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
                (ol, zr) = (totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1)
                if zr <= ol:
                    zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
                    oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
                    ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
                else:
                    zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
                    oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
                    ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        print(*ans)

    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s1 = data[index]
        index += 1
        func_2(s1, n)

main()
