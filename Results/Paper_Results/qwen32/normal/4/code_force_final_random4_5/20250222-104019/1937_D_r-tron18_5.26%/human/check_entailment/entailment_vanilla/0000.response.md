Let's analyze the provided Python program and determine whether it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to simulate the movement of a pinball on a grid based on the direction indicated by the characters '<' and '>', and then determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to exit the grid from either end. Each character flips its direction after the pinball moves over it.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Let's break down what each function does and how they interact.

#### Function 1: `func_1(arr, times)`
- **Purpose**: This function calculates a value based on the accumulated sums in `arr` and the number of times `times`.
- **Implementation**: It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)`. This seems to be a way to index into the array `arr` from the end, but the meaning of `n` is not clear from this function alone.

#### Function 2: `func_2(s1, n)`
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
- **Implementation**:
  - It initializes two lists: `pre` to store the positions of '>' characters and `preOne` as the accumulated sums of `pre`.
  - It also initializes `suffZero` to keep track of cumulative sums of positions of '<' characters from the right.
  - For each position in the grid, it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to exit based on the current character and the accumulated sums.
  - The logic seems to be complex and involves handling different cases based on the count of '>' and '<' characters.
  - Finally, it prints the calculated times for each starting position.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The program's correctness relies on accurately simulating the pinball movement and correctly handling the accumulation and indexing of positions. However, the implementation appears to be overly complex and not straightforwardly related to the problem's requirements. Here are some points to consider:
- **Complexity**: The use of accumulated sums and complex indexing might be an attempt to optimize the solution, but it makes the logic hard to follow and verify.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle edge cases such as a grid with only one character or grids with all '<' or all '>' characters.
- **Correctness of Logic**: The logic for calculating the time to exit the grid is not immediately clear from the code. It involves complex calculations that might not be directly related to the pinball's movement rules.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity and the lack of clear correspondence between the code logic and the problem description, it is difficult to verify the correctness of the program without a more detailed understanding of the intended algorithm. However, based on the provided code, it is not immediately evident that the program correctly simulates the pinball movement and calculates the exit times as required.

**Correctness: False**
