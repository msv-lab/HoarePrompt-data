To determine the output state, we need to focus on the line of code that modifies the variables:

```python
oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
```

This line calculates the value of `oneInd` by calling a function `func_1` with `preOne` and `zr` as arguments, and then multiplying the result by 2.

Given that:
- `preOne` is a list of cumulative counts of '>' characters up to each index in the original list `pre`.
- `zr` is `1` and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol` (which is `totalOne`).

Let's denote the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)` as `result`. Then `oneInd` will be `2 * result`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, we can only express `oneInd` in terms of `func_1(preOne, zr)`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0; `suffZero` is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `i` is `n - 1`; `el` is `s1[n - 1]`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `1` and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`; `zeroInd` is `n`; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**.
