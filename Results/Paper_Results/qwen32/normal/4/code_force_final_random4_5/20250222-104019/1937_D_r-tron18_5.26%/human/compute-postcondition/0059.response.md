The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been decremented by 1. Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to decrement `i` by 1 again.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element potentially removed.
- `suffZero` is adjusted based on the value of `el`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` and possibly at index `n-2`.
- `i` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3` based on the condition.
- `el` is updated to `s1[n - 2]` or `s1[n - 3]`.
- `ol` and `zr` remain unchanged or are recalculated.
- `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`.

Since only `i` can be adjusted in the loop head, we need to decrement `i` by 1 for the next iteration.
