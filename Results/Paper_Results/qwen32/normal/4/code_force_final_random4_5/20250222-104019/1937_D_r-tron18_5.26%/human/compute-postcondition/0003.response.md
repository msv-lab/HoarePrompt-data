The code snippet provided initializes a new list `suffZero` with a single element `[0]`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`). Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `suffZero` with the value `[0]`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0; `suffZero` is `[0]`.**
