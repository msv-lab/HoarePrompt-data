Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element potentially removed; `suffZero` is adjusted based on the value of `el` and now includes an additional element which is the sum of the last element of `suffZero` and `i + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1`, possibly at index `n-2`, and now at index `i` where it is calculated based on whether `zr <= ol` or not; `i` is `i - 1`; `el` is updated to `s1[i - 1]`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`. Specifically, if `zr <= ol`, then `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` where `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd` where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.**
