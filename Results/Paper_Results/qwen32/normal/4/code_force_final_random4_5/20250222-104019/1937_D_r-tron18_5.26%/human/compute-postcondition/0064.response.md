The given code snippet modifies the value of `ans[i]` based on the calculated values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. Other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified.

The new value of `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd`, where:
- `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`
- `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`

Thus, the value of `ans[i]` is updated to `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element potentially removed; `suffZero` is adjusted based on the value of `el`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` and possibly at index `n-2` where they are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`; `i` is `i - 1`; `el` is updated to `s1[i - 1]`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `ans[i]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`.**
