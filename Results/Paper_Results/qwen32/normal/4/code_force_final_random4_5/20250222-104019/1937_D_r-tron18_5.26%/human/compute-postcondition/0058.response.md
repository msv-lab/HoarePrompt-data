Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el` (specifically, it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 or 2 depending on the conditions); `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element potentially removed; `suffZero` is adjusted based on the value of `el` (specifically, it is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes additional elements); `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` and possibly at index `n-2` where they are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`; `i` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3` based on the condition, `el` is updated to `s1[n - 2]` or `s1[n - 3]`, and `ol` and `zr` remain unchanged or are recalculated. `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`. If `el` is '>', the calculations for `ans[n-1]` and `ans[n-2]` are based on specific conditions involving `ol` and `zr`. If `el` is not '>', the calculations for `ans[n-1]` and `ans[n-2]` are based on different conditions involving `ol` and `zr`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, taking into account the different calculations and updates based on the value of `el`.
