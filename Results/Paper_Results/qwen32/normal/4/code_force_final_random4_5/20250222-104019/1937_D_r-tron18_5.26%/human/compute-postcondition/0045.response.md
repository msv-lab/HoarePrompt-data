Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` and `n-2` where they are calculated based on the conditions; `i` is `n - 3`; `el` is `s1[n - 3]`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`; `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**

Explanation: The value of `ans[i]` at index `i = n - 2` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. The value of `i` is then decremented by 1, making `i = n - 3`. The variables `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi` remain the same unless further calculations change them.
