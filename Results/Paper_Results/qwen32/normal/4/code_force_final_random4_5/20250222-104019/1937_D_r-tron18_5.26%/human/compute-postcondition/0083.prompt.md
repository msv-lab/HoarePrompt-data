Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0; `suffZero` is `[0]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` where it is calculated based on the condition `ol <= zr`. If `el` is '>' and `ol <= zr`, `ans[n-1]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`. If `el` is '>' and `ol > zr`, `ans[n-1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is not '>' and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `ans[n - 1]` is `2 * n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + 1`. If `el` is not '>' and `zr` is greater than `ol`, `ans[n - 1]` is `1 - 2 * totalOne`. `i` is `n - 1`; `el` is `s1[n - 1]`. `ol` is `totalOne` plus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `totalOne`. `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `1`. If `el` is '>' and `ol <= zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. If `el` is '>' and `ol > zr`, `zeroInd` is `0` and `oneInd` is `preOne[1] - x`, and `fi` is `1`. If `el` is not '>' and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` is `n` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. If `el` is not '>' and `zr` is greater than `ol`, `zeroInd` is `1` and `oneInd` is `2 * totalOne`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el` (specifically, it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 or 2 depending on the conditions); `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element potentially removed; `suffZero` is adjusted based on the value of `el` (specifically, it is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes additional elements); `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` and possibly at index `n-2` where they are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`; `i` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3` based on the condition, `el` is updated to `s1[n - 2]` or `s1[n - 3]`, and `ol` and `zr` remain unchanged or are recalculated. `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`. If `el` is '>', the calculations for `ans[n-1]` and `ans[n-2]` are based on specific conditions involving `ol` and `zr`. If `el` is not '>', the calculations for `ans[n-1]` and `ans[n-2]` are based on different conditions involving `ol` and `zr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el` and is decreased by 1 if `el` is '>'; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element potentially removed; `suffZero` is adjusted based on the value of `el` and includes an additional element which is the sum of the last element of `suffZero` and `i + 1` if `el` is not '>'; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1`, possibly at index `n-2`, and now at index `i` where it is calculated based on whether `zr <= ol` or not; `i` is `i - 1`; `el` is updated to `s1[i - 1]`; `ol` is `totalOne` (before it was decremented if `el` is '>'); `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`. Specifically, if `zr <= ol`, then `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` where `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd` where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
