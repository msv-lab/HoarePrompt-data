The given code snippet appends a new value to the `suffZero` list. The new value is calculated as the last element of `suffZero` plus `i + 1`. 

Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 2`, and `suffZero` is either `[0]` or `[0, n]` depending on whether `el` is `'>'` or not. Therefore, the new value appended to `suffZero` is `suffZero[-1] + (n - 2) + 1`.

Let's break it down:
- If `suffZero` was `[0]`:
  - The new value appended is `0 + (n - 2) + 1 = n - 1`.
  - `suffZero` becomes `[0, n - 1]`.

- If `suffZero` was `[0, n]`:
  - The new value appended is `n + (n - 2) + 1 = 2n - 1`.
  - `suffZero` becomes `[0, n, 2n - 1]`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, n - 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n, 2n - 1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` where it is calculated based on the condition `ol <= zr`; `i` is `n - 2`; `el` is `s1[n - 2]`. `ol` is `totalOne` plus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `totalOne`. `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `1`. If `el` is '>' and `ol <= zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. If `el` is '>' and `ol > zr`, `zeroInd` is `0` and `oneInd` is `preOne[1] - x`, and `fi` is `1`. If `el` is not '>' and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` is `n` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. If `el` is not '>' and `zr` is greater than `ol`, `zeroInd` is `1` and `oneInd` is `2 * totalOne`.**
