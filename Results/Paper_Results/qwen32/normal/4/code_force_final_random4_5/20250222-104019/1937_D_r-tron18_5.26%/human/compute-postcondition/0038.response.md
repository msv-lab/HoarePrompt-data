The given code snippet modifies the variable `zeroInd` by assigning it the value of `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`. The values of other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` where it is calculated based on the condition `ol <= zr`. If `el` is '>' and `ol <= zr`, `ans[n-1]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`. If `el` is '>' and `ol > zr`, `ans[n-1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is not '>' and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `ans[n - 1]` is `2 * n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + 1`. If `el` is not '>' and `zr` is greater than `ol`, `ans[n - 1]` is `1 - 2 * totalOne`. `i` is `n - 2`; `el` is `s1[n - 2]`. `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`. `oneInd` and `fi` remain as previously defined based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`.**

In natural language, the output state indicates that the variable `zeroInd` has been updated to `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`. All other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
