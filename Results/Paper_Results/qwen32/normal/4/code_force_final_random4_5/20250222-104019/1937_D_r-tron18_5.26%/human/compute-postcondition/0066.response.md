To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the line `oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` on the variables. Given the initial state, the variables `preOne`, `zr`, and `oneInd` are of particular interest. 

- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0.
- `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `oneInd` is calculated based on the output of `func_1` at indices `zr` and `zr + 1`.

The line of code calculates `oneInd` by summing the results of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`. The values of `preOne`, `zr`, and the function `func_1` are not explicitly defined, but we can infer the impact on `oneInd`.

The values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, and `zeroInd` are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element potentially removed; `suffZero` is adjusted based on the value of `el`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` and possibly at index `n-2` where they are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`; `i` is `i - 1`; `el` is updated to `s1[i - 1]`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is 2 * suffZero[-1]; `oneInd` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`**.

In simple terms, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that `oneInd` is now calculated as the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`.
