The code assigns the value `1` to `vis[node]`, indicating that the node has been visited. The values of `ver`, `graph`, `node`, and `q` remain unchanged as per the given initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`ver` is a vertex that is a key in `graph` and `graph[ver]` is a list or set containing at least two neighbors; `node` is the next neighbor in `graph[ver]` that has not yet been processed; `q` has `node` appended to it; `vis[node]` is 1.**
