The code snippet sets `vis[node]` to 1. This changes the value of `vis[node]` from `False` to `1`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ver` is a node that has at least one neighbor in the graph, `graph[ver]` is a list containing at least one neighbor, `vis[node]` is `1`, and `q` now contains `node` as its last element.**
