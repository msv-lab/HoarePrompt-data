The value of `j` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `j` is at least 2, after decrementing, `j` will be at least 1. The value of `dp` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`, `i` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`; `i` is at least 1; `j` is at least 1.**
