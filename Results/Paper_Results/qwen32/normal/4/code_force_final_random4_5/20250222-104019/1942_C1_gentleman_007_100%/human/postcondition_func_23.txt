The function `func_24` starts from a given vertex `ver` and performs a depth-first traversal of the graph, marking all visited vertices in the `vis` list or dictionary. It prints each visited vertex. The function does not return a value but modifies the `vis` list or dictionary to reflect the visited status of the vertices.
