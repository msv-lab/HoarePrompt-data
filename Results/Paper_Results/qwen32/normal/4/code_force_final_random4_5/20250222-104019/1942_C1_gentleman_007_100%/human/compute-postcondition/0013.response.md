The code `vis[node] = 1` sets the value of the key `node` in the dictionary `vis` to 1. This indicates that the node has been visited. The other variables and their states remain unchanged as per the initial conditions provided.

Output State: **`ver` is a vertex that is a key in `graph` and `graph[ver]` is a list or set containing at least two neighbors; `node` is the next neighbor in `graph[ver]` after the previously processed node; `q` has `node` appended to it; `vis[node]` is 1.**
