Postcondition: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`. `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` represents the length of the LCS of `a` and `b`. `i` and `j` must be non-zero. If `dp[i][j]` was equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `j` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is decremented by 1. If neither condition holds, both `i` and `j` are decremented by 1, and `l` has an additional element `a[i]` appended to it.**
