The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The other variables, including `dp`, `i`, and the precondition that `i` is at least 2 and `j` is at least 2, remain unchanged except for the new value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`; `i` is at least 2; `j` is at least 1 (since `j` was at least 2 and has been decremented by 1).

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`; `i` is at least 2; `j` is at least 1.**
