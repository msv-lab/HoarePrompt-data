Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or adjacency list representing the graph where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list or dictionary used to keep track of visited vertices where `vis[node]` is 1 if the node has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is a deque object with `ver` appended to it, and `vis[ver]` is 1.**

In simpler terms: The vertex `ver` has been marked as visited by setting `vis[ver]` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
