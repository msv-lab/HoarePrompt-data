The value of `j` is decremented by 1. All other variables, including the 2D list `dp`, `i`, and the lengths of `a` and `b`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`. `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` represents the length of the LCS of `a` and `b`. `i` must be non-zero and `j` must be non-zero; `j` is decremented by 1.**
