The only variable in the loop head is `node`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `graph[ver]`. If `graph[ver]` contains more than one neighbor, the loop can execute again for the next neighbor.

At the end of the last iteration, `ver` is a node that has at least one neighbor in the graph, and `graph[ver]` is a list containing at least one neighbor. `node` has taken on the value of one of these neighbors. For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one more neighbor that `node` can take on.

State: **`ver` is a node that has at least two neighbors in the graph, `graph[ver]` is a list containing at least two neighbors, `node` is the next neighbor in the list after the last one processed.**
