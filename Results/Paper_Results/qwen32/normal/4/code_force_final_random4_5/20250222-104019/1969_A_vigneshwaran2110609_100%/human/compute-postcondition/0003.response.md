The code provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `l`. The initial state of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `x` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, and `p_i` != `i`; `x` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
