Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`; `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `flag` is True; `i` is 4**

In natural language: The variable `flag` has been set to `True`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `x`, `l`, and `i`) retain their initial values.
