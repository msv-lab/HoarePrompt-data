`x` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `i` was `x`, so now `i` is also updated to this new input value. The list `l` and the condition that `n` must be greater than `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input string, and `n` must be greater than `x`.**
