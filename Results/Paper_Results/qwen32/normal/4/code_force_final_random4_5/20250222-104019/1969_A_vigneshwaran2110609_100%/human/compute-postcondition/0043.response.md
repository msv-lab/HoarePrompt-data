The provided code snippet updates the list `l` by reading a new input string, stripping it of any leading or trailing whitespace, splitting it by spaces, and converting each resulting substring into an integer. The variables `i`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `l`, which now holds the new list of integers derived from the input string.

Output State: **`i` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input string, and `n` must be greater than `x`.**
