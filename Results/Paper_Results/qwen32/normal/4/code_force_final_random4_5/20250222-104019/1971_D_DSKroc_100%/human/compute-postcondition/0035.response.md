Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least 2 characters, `flag` is 0, and `q` is incremented by 1. If the integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.**
