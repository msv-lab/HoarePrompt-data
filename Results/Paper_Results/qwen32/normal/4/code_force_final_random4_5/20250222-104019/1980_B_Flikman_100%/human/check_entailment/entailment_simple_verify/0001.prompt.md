You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each execution, it has read integers `n`, `f`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It has determined the `favorite_value` as `a[f - 1]`, sorted the list `a` in descending order to get `sorted_a`, and counted how many times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements (`removed_count`) and in the entire `sorted_a` list (`favorite_count`). Depending on the comparison between `removed_count` and `favorite_count`, it has printed 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE'. After all `t` iterations, `t` is reduced to 0, and no more inputs are processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's examine the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the values on the cubes.

2. **Identifying the Favorite Cube:**
   - The value of the favorite cube is stored in `favorite_value` using `a[f - 1]` because the list is 0-indexed.

3. **Sorting the Cubes:**
   - The list of cube values is sorted in non-increasing order using `sorted(a, reverse=True)`.

4. **Counting Removed Cubes:**
   - The program counts how many times the favorite value appears in the first `k` elements of the sorted list (`removed_count`).

5. **Counting Total Occurrences of Favorite Value:**
   - The program counts the total occurrences of `favorite_value` in the sorted list (`favorite_count`).

6. **Determining the Output:**
   - If `removed_count` equals `favorite_count`, it means all occurrences of the favorite cube were removed, so it prints "YES".
   - If `removed_count` is 0, it means no occurrences of the favorite cube were removed, so it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "MAYBE" because it indicates that some, but not all, occurrences of the favorite cube could have been removed.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- The program correctly identifies the favorite cube and counts its occurrences.
- It correctly sorts the cubes in non-increasing order.
- It correctly counts the number of removed cubes that match the favorite value.
- The logic for determining the output is correct:
  - "YES" if all favorite cubes are removed.
  - "NO" if none of the favorite cubes are removed.
  - "MAYBE" if some favorite cubes could be removed but not all.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
