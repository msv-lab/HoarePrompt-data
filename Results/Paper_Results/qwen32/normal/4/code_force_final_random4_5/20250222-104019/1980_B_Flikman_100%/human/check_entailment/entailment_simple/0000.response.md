### Reasoning:
The program is designed to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed based on the sorting and removal process described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the values on the cubes.

2. **Identifying the Favorite Cube**:
   - The favorite cube's value is identified as `a[f - 1]` (since list indices in Python are 0-based).

3. **Sorting**:
   - The list of cube values is sorted in non-increasing order using `sorted(a, reverse=True)`.

4. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program counts how many times the favorite cube's value appears in the first `k` elements of the sorted list (`removed_count`).
   - It also counts how many times the favorite cube's value appears in the entire sorted list (`favorite_count`).

5. **Decision Making**:
   - If `removed_count` equals `favorite_count`, it means all instances of the favorite cube's value are among the first `k` elements, so the favorite cube will be removed in all cases. The program prints "YES".
   - If `removed_count` is 0, it means none of the favorite cube's values are among the first `k` elements, so the favorite cube will not be removed in any case. The program prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it means the favorite cube might or might not be removed depending on its position after sorting. The program prints "MAYBE".

### Evaluation:
The logic correctly captures the conditions specified in the problem statement. It properly handles the cases where the favorite cube is definitely removed, definitely not removed, or might be removed based on its value's position in the sorted list.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct according to the problem description and the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
