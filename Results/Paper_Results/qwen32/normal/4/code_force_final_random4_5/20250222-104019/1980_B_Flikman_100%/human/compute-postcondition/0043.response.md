Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order. If `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, `removed_count` is 3; otherwise, `removed_count` is 2. `favorite_count` is undefined, `i` is `i + 2`.**

This means that after the if-else block, `t` remains `t - 1`, `n` and `f` retain their original values from the input, `k` is still greater than 0, `a` and `sorted_a` remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 2. Additionally, `removed_count` is set to 3 if `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value`; otherwise, `removed_count` is set to 2. The value of `favorite_count` remains undefined.
