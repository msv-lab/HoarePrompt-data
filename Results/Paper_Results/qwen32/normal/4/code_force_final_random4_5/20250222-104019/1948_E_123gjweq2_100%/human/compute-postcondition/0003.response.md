The value of `not_mid` is calculated as `right - left + 1 - mid`. Given that `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, we can substitute and simplify the expression for `not_mid`.

The expression for `not_mid` can be rewritten as:
\[ \text{not\_mid} = (right - left + 1) - \left(\frac{right - left + 1}{2}\right) \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \text{not\_mid} = \left(\frac{2 \times (right - left + 1) - (right - left + 1)}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{right - left + 1}{2}\right) \]

However, since integer division is used, `not_mid` will be the integer part of the division of `right - left + 1` by 2. If `right - left + 1` is odd, `not_mid` will be one less than `mid`; if `right - left + 1` is even, `not_mid` will be equal to `mid`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`.**
