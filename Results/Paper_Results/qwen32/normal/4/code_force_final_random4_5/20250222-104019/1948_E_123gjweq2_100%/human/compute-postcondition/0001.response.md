The code assigns the value of `right + 1` to the variable `big_element`. The initial state specifies that `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n`, and `clique` is an integer representing the clique number. Additionally, `small_element` is `left + 1`. After the execution of the given code snippet, the value of `big_element` is determined to be `right + 1`. The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, and `small_element` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, and `big_element` is `right + 1`.**
