To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(mid):`, so we need to ensure that `mid` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Let's break down the given state and see what adjustments are necessary:

- `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n.
- `clique` is an integer representing the clique number.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`.

The value of `mid` is calculated as `(right - left + 1) // 2`. For the loop to execute, `mid` must be greater than 0. This means `(right - left + 1) // 2 > 0`, which simplifies to `right - left + 1 > 0` or `right - left >= 0`. Given the condition `0 <= left < right < n`, `right - left` is already greater than 0, so `mid` should naturally be greater than 0.

However, we need to ensure that the initial values of `left` and `right` satisfy the conditions. Since `0 <= left < right < n`, we need to make sure that `right` is at least `left + 1` to ensure that `mid` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `right` is at least `left + 1`.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n and right - left >= 1, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`**
