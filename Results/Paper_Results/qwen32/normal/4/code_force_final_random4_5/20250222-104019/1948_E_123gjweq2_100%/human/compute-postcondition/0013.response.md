To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and how it modifies the array `arr` and the list `cliquess`.

The loop runs for `mid` iterations, where `mid` is calculated as `(right - left + 1) // 2`. During each iteration `i`, the loop performs the following actions:
1. `arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i`
2. `cliquess[left + i] = clique`

Let's break down the changes step by step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `small_element = left + 1`
   - `mid = (right - left + 1) // 2`
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = mid - 1`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For `i = 0`:
     - `arr[left + mid - 0 - 1] = small_element + 0` → `arr[left + mid - 1] = left + 1`
     - `cliquess[left + 0] = clique` → `cliquess[left] = clique`
   - For `i = 1`:
     - `arr[left + mid - 1 - 1] = small_element + 1` → `arr[left + mid - 2] = left + 2`
     - `cliquess[left + 1] = clique` → `cliquess[left + 1] = clique`
   - For `i = 2`:
     - `arr[left + mid - 2 - 1] = small_element + 2` → `arr[left + mid - 3] = left + 3`
     - `cliquess[left + 2] = clique` → `cliquess[left + 2] = clique`
   - This pattern continues until `i = mid - 1`.

3. **Final State:**
   - After the loop completes, `arr` will have the values `left + 1, left + 2, ..., left + mid` in the positions `left + mid - 1, left + mid - 2, ..., left` respectively.
   - `cliquess` will have the value `clique` in the positions `left, left + 1, ..., left + mid - 1`.

The output state after the loop completes all iterations is:

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right - left >= 1`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + i` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the array `arr` will have the sequence of numbers starting from `left + 1` to `left + mid` in the positions from `left + mid - 1` to `left`, and the list `cliquess` will have the value `clique` in the positions from `left` to `left + mid - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
