The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `not_mid`. If `i` is less than `not_mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
2. All other variables remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right - left >= 1`; `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`; `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`; `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + i` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1`; `i` is 2; `arr[left + mid]` is `right + 1`; `cliquess[left + mid]` is `clique`; `arr[left + mid + 1]` is `right`; `cliquess[left + mid + 1]` is `clique`.**
