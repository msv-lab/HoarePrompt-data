### Reasoning:

The program aims to create a graph based on the given conditions and then partition it into the minimum number of cliques. The correctness of the program will be evaluated based on whether it generates a valid assignment of integers to vertices, constructs the graph according to the rules, and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques.

Let's break down the program's functionality:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It calculates the number of cliques needed as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two lists: `arr` (to store the assigned integers for each vertex) and `cliquess` (to store the clique number for each vertex).
   - It calls `make_array` for each segment of the array to assign values and set clique numbers.

3. **Function `make_array`:**
   - It assigns values to a segment of the `arr` list and sets the corresponding clique numbers in the `cliquess` list.
   - The first half of the segment is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1`.
   - The second half is filled with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`.
   - All elements in the segment are assigned the same clique number.

### Analysis:

- **Assignment of Integers:**
  - The function `make_array` assigns distinct integers to vertices within each segment, ensuring that all integers from 1 to `n` are used exactly once across all segments.
  
- **Graph Construction:**
  - The condition for adding an edge between vertices `(i, j)` is `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`. The assignment of integers and the way segments are filled should ensure that vertices within the same segment are connected as per this rule.
  
- **Partitioning into Cliques:**
  - The program partitions the graph into `ceil(n / k)` cliques, which is a reasonable approach to minimize the number of cliques. Each segment corresponds to a clique, and vertices within the same segment are connected.

### Verification:

- **Example 1:**
  - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the output `2 1`, `1`, and `1 1` is correct because:
    - The integers assigned to vertices are `2` and `1`.
    - The graph can be partitioned into `1` clique.
    - Both vertices are in the same clique.
  
- **Example 2:**
  - For `n = 5` and `k = 4`, the output `3 1 5 2 4`, `2`, and `1 1 2 1 2` is correct because:
    - The integers assigned to vertices are `3`, `1`, `5`, `2`, and `4`.
    - The graph can be partitioned into `2` cliques.
    - Vertices `1`, `3`, and `5` are in one clique, and vertices `2` and `4` are in another clique.
  
- **Example 3:**
  - For `n = 8` and `k = 16`, the output `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8`, `1`, and `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1` is correct because:
    - The integers assigned to vertices are `1` to `8`.
    - The graph can be partitioned into `1` clique.
    - All vertices are in the same clique.

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be correctly implementing the required functionality.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
