To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs for `not_mid` iterations, where `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`.
- In each iteration `i`, the loop sets:
  - `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i`
  - `cliquess[left + mid + i]` to `clique`

### Observations from the Given Output States:
1. **After 1 iteration (`i = 0`)**:
   - `arr[left + mid]` is set to `right + 1`
   - `cliquess[left + mid]` is set to `clique`

2. **After 2 iterations (`i = 1`)**:
   - `arr[left + mid + 1]` is set to `right`
   - `cliquess[left + mid + 1]` is set to `clique`

3. **After 3 iterations (`i = 2`)**:
   - `arr[left + mid + 2]` is set to `right - 1`
   - `cliquess[left + mid + 2]` is set to `clique`

### General Pattern:
- The loop sets the elements in the `arr` array starting from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` to values decreasing from `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`.
- The `cliquess` array is set to `clique` for the same indices.

### Final Output State:
- Since `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, the loop runs `not_mid` times.
- After all iterations, `arr[left + mid + i]` for `i` in `0` to `not_mid - 1` will be set to values from `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`.

### Conclusion:
- The final state of `arr` will have the first `mid` elements set to increasing values from `left + 1` to `left + mid`, and the next `not_mid` elements set to decreasing values from `right + 1` to `right - not_mid + 2`.
- The `cliquess` array will have the first `mid` elements set to `clique`, and the next `not_mid` elements also set to `clique`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right - left >= 1`; `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`; `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`; `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + i` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right + 1 - i` for `i` in `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `0` to `not_mid - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the `arr` array will have the first half filled with increasing values from `left + 1` to `left + mid`, and the second half filled with decreasing values from `right + 1` to `right - not_mid + 2`. The `cliquess` array will be filled with the `clique` value for all elements in the range.
