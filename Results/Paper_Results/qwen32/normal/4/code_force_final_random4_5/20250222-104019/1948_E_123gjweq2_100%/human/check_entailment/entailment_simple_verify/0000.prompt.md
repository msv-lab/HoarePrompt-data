You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Global Variables**: The `arr` and `cliquess` variables are used in the `make_array` function but are not defined within that function or passed as parameters. This will result in a `NameError` because they are not recognized in the local scope of `make_array`.

2. **Incomplete Assignment**: The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are initialized with zeros, but the `make_array` function does not update these global variables correctly. The `arr` and `cliquess` variables inside `make_array` are local to that function and do not affect the global variables.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Clique Assignment**: The logic to assign vertices to cliques and to assign values to vertices does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The current implementation does not guarantee that every pair of vertices within a clique will have an edge between them based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases where `k` is very small or very large, which could affect the number of cliques and the assignment of values to vertices.

To fix these issues, the code needs to properly initialize and update the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays, ensure that the condition for edge creation is correctly applied, and verify that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

Here is a corrected version of the code that addresses these issues:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(n, k):
    arr = list(range(1, n + 1))
    cliques = [1] * n

    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if abs(i - j) + abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) > k:
                cliques[i] = cliques[j] + 1
                break

    max_clique = max(cliques)
    print(*arr)
    print(max_clique)
    print(*cliques)

# Example usage:
# func_1(2, 3)
# func_1(5, 4)
# func_1(8, 16)

# Reading input and processing test cases:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    func_1(n, k)
```

This corrected version initializes `arr` with distinct integers from 1 to `n` and assigns each vertex to a clique based on the condition provided. It ensures that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
