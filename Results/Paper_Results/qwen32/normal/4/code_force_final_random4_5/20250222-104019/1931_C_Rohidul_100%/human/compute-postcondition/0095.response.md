Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and prints a value for each test case based on the list `a`. The value printed represents the minimum number of elements to remove from the list so that the remaining list does not have the same starting and ending elements that are also the same as the longest contiguous segments at the start or end of the list.**
