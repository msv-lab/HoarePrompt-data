The code snippet `end += 1` increments the value of the variable `end` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state:
- `r` is `le - 2`
- `l` is `le - 2`
- `a` is a list where all elements are the same
- `end` is 1
- `ans` is `max(0, le - 2n)` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` is `le - n`
- `n` is the new input integer
- `le` is the length of the new `a`
- `st` is `le`

After executing `end += 1`, the value of `end` changes from 1 to 2.

Output State: **`r` is `le - 2`, `l` is `le - 2`, `a` is a list where all elements are the same, `end` is 2, `ans` is `max(0, le - 2n)` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` is `le - n`, `n` is the new input integer, `le` is the length of the new `a`, `st` is `le`.**
