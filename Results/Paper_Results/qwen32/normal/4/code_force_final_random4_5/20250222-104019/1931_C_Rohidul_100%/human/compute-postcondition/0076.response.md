The code snippet `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. The initial value of `st` is 3, so after the execution, `st` becomes 4. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`r` must be greater than 2, `l` is 3, `a` is a list where the first two elements and the third and fourth elements are the same, `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - 2n)` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` is `le - n`, `n` is the new input integer, `le` is the length of the new `a`, `st` is 4.**
