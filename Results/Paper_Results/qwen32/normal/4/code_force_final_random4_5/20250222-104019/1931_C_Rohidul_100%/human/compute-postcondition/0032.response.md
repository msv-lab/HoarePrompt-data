The provided Python code snippet only includes `n = int(input())`, which means the variable `n` is assigned the integer value of the user's input. None of the other variables (`r`, `end`, `ans`, `le`, `st`, `a`) are affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state will only include the new value of `n`, with all other variables remaining as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`r` is `l`, `end` is incremented by 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `le - max(st, end + 1)`, `n` is an input integer.**
