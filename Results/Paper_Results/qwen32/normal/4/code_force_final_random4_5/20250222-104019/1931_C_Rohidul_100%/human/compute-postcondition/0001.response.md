`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `int(input())` must be equal to `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `n` is the integer value input by the user.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value input by the user.**
