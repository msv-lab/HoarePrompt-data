To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Condition `l < r`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` was increased by 1. To ensure that `l < r` holds true for the next iteration, `r` must be greater than the new value of `l`.

2. **Condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` was increased by 1, and `st` was also increased by 1. To ensure that `a[l] == a[l + 1]` holds true for the next iteration, the elements at the new indices `l` and `l + 1` must be equal.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the state such that:
- `r` is greater than the new value of `l`.
- `a[l]` is equal to `a[l + 1]`.

Let's denote the new value of `l` after it has been increased by 1 as `l_new`. Therefore, `l_new = l + 1`.

State: **`l` is increased by 1, `r` must be greater than `l + 1`, `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`, and `st` is increased by 1**

Simplifying the state description to focus only on the necessary adjustments:
State: **`l` is increased by 1, `r` must be greater than `l + 1`, and `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`**
