The code snippet assigns the value `1` to both `st` and `end`. The other variables (`r`, `ans`, `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is 0, `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - 2n)` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` is `le - n`, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the new list of integers from input, `le` is the length of the new `a`, `l` is 0, `st` is 1**.
