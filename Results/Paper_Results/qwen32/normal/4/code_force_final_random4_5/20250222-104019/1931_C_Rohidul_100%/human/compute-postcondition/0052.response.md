The code snippet `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. Given the initial state, `end` is initially `2`. After the increment, `end` becomes `3`.

The values of the other variables (`r`, `ans`, `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`, `st`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is `n - 2`, `end` is `3`, `ans` is calculated based on the conditions given, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers such that `a[n] == a[n - 1]`, `le` is the length of `a` and `le` must be at least `n + 1`, `l` is `n - 2`, `st` is `n`**
