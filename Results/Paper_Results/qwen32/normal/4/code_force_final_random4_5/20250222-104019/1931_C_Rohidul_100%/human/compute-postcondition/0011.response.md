The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The other variables `l`, `r`, and the elements of the array `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is increased by 2, `r` must be greater than `l + 1`, `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`, and `st` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is increased by 2, `r` must be greater than `l + 1`, `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`, `st` is increased by 1**.
