Postcondition: **`r` is `le - 1`, `l` is `le - 1`, `a` is a list where all elements are the same, `end` is `le`, `ans` is `0`, `n` is the new input integer, `le` is the length of the new `a`, `st` is `le`. There is no change in the values of `r`, `l`, `a`, `end`, `ans`, `n`, `le`, or `st` regardless of whether `a[0] == a[-1]` is true or false.**
