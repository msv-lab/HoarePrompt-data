The given code snippet reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The initial state of other variables (`r`, `end`, `ans`, and `n`) is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `r`, `end`, `ans`, and `n` remain the same.

Output State: **`r` is `l`, `end` is incremented by 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `le - max(st, end + 1)`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input.**
