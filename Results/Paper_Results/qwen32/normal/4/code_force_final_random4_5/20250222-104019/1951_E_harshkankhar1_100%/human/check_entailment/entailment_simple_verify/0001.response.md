### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the problem description and the provided program to ensure a thorough evaluation.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to partition a string `s` into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome.
- If such a partition exists, we print "YES", followed by the number of substrings and the substrings themselves.
- If no such partition exists, we print "NO".

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
   - It correctly returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - The function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It initializes `n` as the length of `s` and `x` as -1.
   - If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome, it correctly prints "YES", the number of partitions as 1, and the string `s` itself as the partition.
   - If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first index `i` where `s[i]` is different from `s[0]`. This index is stored in `x`.
   - If no such index is found (`x == -1`), it correctly prints "NO" because the entire string consists of the same character and thus cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If a valid index `x` is found, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome:
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it correctly prints "YES", the number of partitions as 2, and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, the program further checks if `x` is 1 or `x` is `n // 2`. If either is true, it prints "NO". This part of the logic is flawed because there can be other valid partitions even if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`.
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of partitions as 2, and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`. This part is also flawed because it does not guarantee a valid partition for all cases.

#### Issues Identified:
- The program does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It only processes one test case per invocation.
- The logic for partitioning the string when `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome is incorrect. It does not guarantee a valid partition for all cases.
- The program does not handle the case where a valid partition is possible with more than 2 substrings.

#### Annotations:
The annotations provide insights into the state of the program at key points, confirming the logic described above. However, they do not address the issues with handling multiple test cases and the flawed logic for partitioning when `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
