The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`), and `n` is greater than 1. Since the loop is about to start the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should now be `i_prev + 1`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, and we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `n` for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` (assuming `i` is the value at the end of the previous iteration).

State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `x` is either -1 or `i` depending on whether `s[i]` is equal to `s[0]` or not, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns True. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[0]`, the loop or if statement is broken out of and `x` is set to `i`.** 

However, since we are only concerned with the state of `i` and `n` for the loop to execute one more time, we can simplify it to:

State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
