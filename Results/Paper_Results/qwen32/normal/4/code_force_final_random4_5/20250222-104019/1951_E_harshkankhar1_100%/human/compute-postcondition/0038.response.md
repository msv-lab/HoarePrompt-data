Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from `s[0]`, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns True. Additionally, `x` is not equal to `-1`, meaning there is at least one character in `s` (other than the first character) that is different from `s[0]`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is False, then the current value of `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is False. Otherwise, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True. If `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.**
