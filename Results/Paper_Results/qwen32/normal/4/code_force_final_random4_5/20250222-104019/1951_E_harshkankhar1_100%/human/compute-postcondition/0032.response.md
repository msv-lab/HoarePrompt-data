Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `s` is the input string.
2. `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
3. `x` is the index of the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from `s[0]`. `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`.
4. `func_1(s[0:])` returns True.
5. `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns True.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`. The values of `s`, `n`, `x`, and the results of `func_1` do not influence the output of this specific print statement. The print statement is hardcoded to output `'NO'`.

### Output:
Output: **NO**
