### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`). It returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - **Initial Check**: It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", followed by `1`, and finally the string `s` itself. This is correct because if the whole string is not a palindrome, it can be considered as a single partition.
    - **Finding the First Different Character**: If the entire string is a palindrome, the function then looks for the first character in the string (starting from the second character) that is different from the first character. This is stored in `x`.
    - **Handling Uniform Strings**: If no such different character is found (`x` remains `-1`), it means the string consists of all the same characters, and thus any partition would result in a palindrome. In this case, it prints "NO".
    - **Checking the Remaining String**: If a different character is found, the function checks if the substring starting from this character to the end of the string is not a palindrome. If this substring is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", `2`, and the two partitions.
    - **Handling Special Cases**: If the first different character is at index `1` or at the middle of the string (`n // 2`), it prints "NO" because it would not be possible to partition the string into two non-palindromic substrings in these cases.
    - **Final Partition**: If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "YES", `2`, and the two partitions including the first differing character and the character after it.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - **Single Character Strings**: These are palindromes, so the function will correctly print "NO".
    - **Strings with All Characters the Same**: These are palindromes, so the function will correctly print "NO".
    - **Strings with a Single Different Character**: These can be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings, so the function will correctly print "YES" with the appropriate partitions.
    - **Strings with Multiple Different Characters**: The function will correctly identify if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and print the appropriate result.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles all the described scenarios and edge cases. It correctly identifies whether a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints the appropriate partitions when possible.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
