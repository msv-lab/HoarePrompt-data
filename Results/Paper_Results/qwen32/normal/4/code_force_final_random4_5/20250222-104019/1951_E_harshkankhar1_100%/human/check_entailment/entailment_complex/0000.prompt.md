Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

# Annotated Functions:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string 's' is a palindrome, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome, otherwise it returns `False`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, and x is an integer initialized to -1.
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: s (where s is the input string)
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is either the index of the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from `s[0]`, or `-1` if no such character exists, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns True.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `x` will be the index of the first character in `s` (other than the first character) that is different from `s[0]`, or `-1` if all characters in `s` are the same.
    #
    #Output State:
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is either the index of the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from `s[0]`, or `-1` if no such character exists, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns True. Additionally, `x` is not equal to `-1`, meaning there is at least one character in `s` (other than the first character) that is different from `s[0]`.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: - The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.
        #
        #Output:
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:] (where s[:x + 1] is the substring from the start of s up to and including the first character different from s[0], and s[x + 1:] is the substring from the first character different from s[0] to the end of s)
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
            print('NO')
            #This is printed: NO
        else :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(2)
            #This is printed: 2
            print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
            #This is printed: s[:x + 2] s[x + 2:] (where s[:x + 2] includes the first differing character and the character after it, and s[x + 2:] includes all characters after the character after the first differing character)
        #State: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from `s[0]`. Additionally, `func_1(s[0:])` returns True and `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns True. If `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
    #State: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from `s[0]`, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns True. Additionally, `x` is not equal to `-1`, meaning there is at least one character in `s` (other than the first character) that is different from `s[0]`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is False, then the current value of `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is False. Otherwise, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True. If `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an input string `s` and checks for the presence of a character different from the first character. Depending on the result of this check and further conditions, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional information about the string. The function always returns `None`.
