You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to partition a string `s` into substrings, where each substring is not a palindrome. If such a partition exists, we need to print "YES" followed by the number of substrings and the substrings themselves. If no such partition exists, we print "NO".

### Program Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Function `func_2()`:**
   - It reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It initializes `n` as the length of `s` and `x` as -1.
   - If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome (`func_1(s[0:]) == False`), it prints "YES", the number of partitions as 1, and the string `s` itself as the partition.
   - If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first index `i` where `s[i]` is different from `s[0]`. This index is stored in `x`.
   - If no such index is found (`x == -1`), it means the entire string `s` consists of the same character and thus cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. It prints "NO".
   - If a valid index `x` is found, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", the number of partitions as 2, and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is 1 or `x` is `n // 2`. If either is true, it prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of partitions as 2, and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

### Issues in the Program
- The function `func_2` does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It only processes one test case per invocation.
- The logic for partitioning the string when `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome is incorrect. It does not guarantee a valid partition for all cases.
- The program does not handle the case where a valid partition is possible with more than 2 substrings.

### Correctness
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
