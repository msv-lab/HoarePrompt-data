Given the initial state:
- `s` is the input string.
- `n` is the length of the input string.
- `x` is -1.
- `func_1(s[0:])` returns False.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(s)
```

Since the task is to determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the variable `s`, which is the input string. The initial state specifies that `s` is the input string, but it does not provide the specific value of `s`. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of `s`.

The `print(s)` statement will print the value of the variable `s`, which is the input string.

Output: **s (where s is the input string)**
