### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Analysis
The task is to partition a string `s` into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program should handle multiple test cases and provide the correct partitioning if possible.

#### Program Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - This function correctly checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Function `func_2()`:**
   - The function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It initializes `n` as the length of `s` and `x` as -1.
   - If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome (`func_1(s[0:]) == False`), it prints "YES", the number of partitions as 1, and the string `s` itself as the partition. This part is correct.
   - If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first index `i` where `s[i]` is different from `s[0]`. This index is stored in `x`.
   - If no such index is found (`x == -1`), it means the entire string `s` consists of the same character and thus cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. It prints "NO". This part is also correct.
   - If a valid index `x` is found, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", the number of partitions as 2, and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`. This part is correct.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is 1 or `x` is `n // 2`. If either is true, it prints "NO". This is incorrect because there are other valid partitions possible.
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of partitions as 2, and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`. This is also incorrect because it does not guarantee a valid partition for all cases.

#### Issues in the Program
- **Multiple Test Cases:** The function `func_2` does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It only processes one test case per invocation. This is a significant issue.
- **Partitioning Logic:** The logic for partitioning the string when `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome is incorrect. It does not guarantee a valid partition for all cases. Specifically, it should try to find a valid partition with more than 2 substrings if possible.
- **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle all edge cases correctly, especially when the string consists of repeated characters or specific patterns.

### Correctness
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
