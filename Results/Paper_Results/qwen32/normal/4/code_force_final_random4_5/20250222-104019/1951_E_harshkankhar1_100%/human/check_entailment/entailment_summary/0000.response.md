### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to determine if a string can be partitioned into substrings, none of which are palindromes. The provided code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which work together to solve this problem.

1. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

2. **Function `func_2()`:**
   - This function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it immediately prints "YES", followed by the number of partitions (which is 1 in this case) and the string itself.
   - If the entire string is a palindrome, it then looks for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character (`s[0]`). This is done using a loop that iterates through the string.
   - If no such character is found (`x` remains -1), it prints "NO" because the entire string consists of the same character, making it impossible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If a different character is found at position `x`, it checks if the substring `s[x+1:]` is not a palindrome. If it is not, it prints "YES" and suggests a partition into two substrings: `s[:x+1]` and `s[x+1:]`.
   - If `s[x+1:]` is a palindrome and `x` is either 1 or `n//2`, it prints "NO" because no valid partition can be formed.
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and suggests a partition into two substrings: `s[:x+2]` and `s[x+2:]`.

### Analysis:

- **Case 1:** If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome, `func_2()` correctly identifies this and outputs "YES" with the string itself as the partition.
- **Case 2:** If the entire string `s` is a palindrome and consists of the same character repeated (e.g., "lllllllll"), `func_2()` correctly identifies this and outputs "NO".
- **Case 3:** If the entire string `s` is a palindrome but contains different characters, `func_2()` attempts to find a valid partition by looking for the first differing character and checking the substring that follows. If this substring is not a palindrome, it outputs "YES" with the suggested partition. If the substring is a palindrome and `x` is either 1 or `n//2`, it outputs "NO". Otherwise, it suggests a different partition.

However, there is a flaw in the logic of `func_2()` for certain cases. Specifically, the condition `elif x == 1 or x == n // 2` is too restrictive. It should be more carefully considered to ensure that a valid partition can be found in all cases where a palindrome can be split into non-palindromic substrings. For example, in the case of `uwuowouwu`, the logic should be able to find a valid partition like `uw`, `uow`, `ouwu`.

### Conclusion:

Given the current logic, the program may not correctly handle all cases, particularly when the string is a palindrome with a more complex structure that can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible inputs.

**Correctness: False**
