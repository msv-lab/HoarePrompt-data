The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `x`. Given that `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, `x` will also be equal to `i + 1`. The values of `s` and `n` remain unchanged. The condition `n` is greater than `i + 1` is also still valid because `i` has been incremented by 1, but the relationship between `n` and `i + 1` is preserved as per the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `i + 1`.**
