### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to see if it correctly implements the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap
- The task is to partition a string `s` into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome.
- If such a partition exists, print "YES", the number of substrings `k`, and the substrings themselves.
- If no such partition exists, print "NO".

#### Program Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function correctly checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - Returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads a string `s` from the input.
   - Initializes `n` as the length of `s` and `x` as -1.
   - If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome (`func_1(s[0:]) == False`), it correctly prints "YES", the number of partitions as 1, and the string `s` itself as the partition.
   - If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first index `i` where `s[i]` is different from `s[0]`. This index is stored in `x`.
   - If no such index is found (`x == -1`), it correctly prints "NO" because the string consists of the same character and thus cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If a valid index `x` is found, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it correctly prints "YES", the number of partitions as 2, and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is 1 or `x` is `n // 2`. If either is true, it prints "NO", which is not always correct. For example, if `x` is `n // 2`, it might still be possible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of partitions as 2, and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

#### Issues in the Program
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` is not wrapped in a loop to handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It only processes one test case per invocation.
- **Partition Logic**: The logic for partitioning the string when `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome is not comprehensive. It does not guarantee a valid partition for all cases. Specifically, the conditions `x == 1` or `x == n // 2` are not sufficient to determine if a valid partition is impossible.
- **Handling More Than Two Substrings**: The program does not handle the case where a valid partition is possible with more than 2 substrings.

### Correctness
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
