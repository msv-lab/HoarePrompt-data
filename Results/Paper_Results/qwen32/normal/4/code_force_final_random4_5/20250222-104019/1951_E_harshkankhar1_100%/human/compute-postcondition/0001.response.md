Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is -1.**

Explanation: The code `n, x = len(s), -1` reassigns `n` to be the length of the input string `s`, and `x` is explicitly set to -1. Since the length of `s` is already described as `n` in the initial state, this reassignment does not change the value of `n`; it merely reaffirms it. The variable `x` is set to -1, which is already its value as per the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to the values of `n` and `x`.
