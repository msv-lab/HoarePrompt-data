To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
This means the loop will start with `i` initialized to 1 and will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is the input string.
- `n` is the length of the input string.
- `x` is -1.
- `func_1(s[0:])` returns True.

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Since the loop starts with `i` initialized to 1, the value of `i` before the loop starts does not need to be adjusted. However, the loop will only execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to (but does not include) `n`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`s` is the input string, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is -1, `func_1(s[0:])` returns True**
