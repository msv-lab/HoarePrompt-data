You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, and x is an integer initialized to -1.
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: s (where s is the input string)
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is either the index of the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from `s[0]`, or `-1` if no such character exists, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns True.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `x` will be the index of the first character in `s` (other than the first character) that is different from `s[0]`, or `-1` if all characters in `s` are the same.
    #
    #Output State:
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is either the index of the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from `s[0]`, or `-1` if no such character exists, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns True. Additionally, `x` is not equal to `-1`, meaning there is at least one character in `s` (other than the first character) that is different from `s[0]`.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: - The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.
        #
        #Output:
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:] (where s[:x + 1] is the substring from the start of s up to and including the first character different from s[0], and s[x + 1:] is the substring from the first character different from s[0] to the end of s)
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
            print('NO')
            #This is printed: NO
        else :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(2)
            #This is printed: 2
            print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
            #This is printed: s[:x + 2] s[x + 2:] (where s[:x + 2] includes the first differing character and the character after it, and s[x + 2:] includes all characters after the character after the first differing character)
        #State: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from `s[0]`. Additionally, `func_1(s[0:])` returns True and `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns True. If `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
    #State: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from `s[0]`, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns True. Additionally, `x` is not equal to `-1`, meaning there is at least one character in `s` (other than the first character) that is different from `s[0]`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is False, then the current value of `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is False. Otherwise, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True. If `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and always returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
