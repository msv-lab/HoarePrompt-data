Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1, `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `high` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 2`, `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2` and `(n + 1) // 2`, `mid` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

The set `st` now contains both `(n - 1) // 2` and `(n + 1) // 2` after the `add` operation. All other variables remain unchanged.
