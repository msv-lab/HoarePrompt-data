Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2` and `(n + 1) // 2`, `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `high` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

In this Output State, the value of `mid` has been recalculated to be the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. Given the initial conditions, `low` and `high` are both equal to `(n - 1) // 2` and `(n + 1) // 2` respectively, so `mid` remains the same as `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
