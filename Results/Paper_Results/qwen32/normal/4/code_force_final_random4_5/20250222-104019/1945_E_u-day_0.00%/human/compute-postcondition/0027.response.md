The code assigns the value of `mid` to `high`. Given that `mid` is `(n + 1) // 2`, the value of `high` is now also `(n + 1) // 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `n` is still greater than 2.
- `k` is still the second value returned by `func_1()`.
- `arr` is still the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `pos` is still the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1.
- `low` is still `(n - 1) // 2`.
- `st` is still a set containing `(n - 1) // 2` and `(n + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1, `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `high` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2` and `(n + 1) // 2`, `mid` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.
