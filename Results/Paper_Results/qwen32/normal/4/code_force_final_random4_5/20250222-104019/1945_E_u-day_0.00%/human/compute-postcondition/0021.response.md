Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1; `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2`, and `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`. Additionally, `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`.**
