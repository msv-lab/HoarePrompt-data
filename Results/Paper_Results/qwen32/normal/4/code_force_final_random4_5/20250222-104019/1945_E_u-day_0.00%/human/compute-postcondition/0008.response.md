The code assigns the value of `i` to the variable `pos`. The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, and `i` is `i + 1`. After the code execution, the value of `i` remains `i + 1`, and `pos` is now equal to `i + 1`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` is still valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `pos` is `i + 1`**.
