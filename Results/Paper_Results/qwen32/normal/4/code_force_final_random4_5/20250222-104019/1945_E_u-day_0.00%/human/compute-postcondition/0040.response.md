The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state provides information about the variables `low`, `high`, `st`, `arr`, and `k`, but this information is not directly relevant to the `print` statement, which is outputting a constant value.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print(1)` statement is straightforward and will output the integer `1`.
2. The variables `low`, `high`, `st`, `arr`, and `k` are mentioned in the initial state, but they do not influence the output of the `print(1)` statement.
3. The condition `arr[low]` is not equal to `k` does not affect the value being printed by the `print(1)` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
