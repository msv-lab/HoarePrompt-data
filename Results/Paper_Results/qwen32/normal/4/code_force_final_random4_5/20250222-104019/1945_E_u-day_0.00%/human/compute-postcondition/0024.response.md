The `while` loop condition is `low + 1 < high`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the condition must be satisfied. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `low` and `high` accordingly.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables are `low` and `high`.

2. **Understand the current state**:
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`.
   - `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
   - `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1.
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `low` is 0 and `high` is `(n - 1) // 2`.
   - Otherwise, `low` is `(n - 1) // 2` and `high` is `n - 1`.
   - In both cases, `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`.

3. **Adjust `low` and `high`**:
   - For the loop to execute, `low + 1 < high` must be true.
   - Since `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and `st` contains `(n - 1) // 2`, we need to ensure that `low` and `high` are set such that `low + 1 < high`.

Given the initial setup:
- If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `low` is 0 and `high` is `(n - 1) // 2`. For the loop to execute again, we need `high` to be greater than `low + 1`.
- If `arr[mid]` is not greater than `k`, `low` is `(n - 1) // 2` and `high` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, we need `high` to be greater than `low + 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure `high` is at least `low + 2`.

**State Adjustment**:
- If `low` is 0, `high` should be at least 2.
- If `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `high` should be at least `((n - 1) // 2) + 2`.

Since `n` is greater than 2, `(n - 1) // 2` is at least 1. Therefore, `high` should be at least `((n - 1) // 2) + 2` to ensure `low + 1 < high`.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1, `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `high` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 2`, `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2`, and `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`**.
