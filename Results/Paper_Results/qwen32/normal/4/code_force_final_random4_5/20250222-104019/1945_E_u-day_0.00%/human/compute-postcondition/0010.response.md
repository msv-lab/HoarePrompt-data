The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 again.

Given the condition `If arr[i] == k, then pos is set to i + 1. Otherwise, pos remains unchanged`, this does not affect the loop header variables `i` and `n`. The value of `pos` is not part of the loop header and does not influence whether the loop continues or not.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 2`**
