You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
    return res



- Function Summary: 
The function takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the count of unique elements in `a` that do not have their bitwise flipped counterparts already encountered in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The program is trying to count the number of groups required such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit. 

However, the logic in the provided code is incorrect. The code is using a bitwise XOR operation with `(1 << 31) - 1` which is equivalent to `2^31 - 1`, a number with all 31 bits set to 1. This operation is not relevant to the problem. The XOR operation here seems to be an attempt to flip all bits, but it is not being used correctly to solve the problem.

The correct approach would involve using a set to track the unique bit patterns of the numbers. Each number's bit pattern from the 1st to the 31st bit should be considered as a tuple or an integer, and we need to ensure that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit pattern.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    bit_patterns = set()
    for num in a:
        # Consider only the last 31 bits
        pattern = num & ((1 << 31) - 1)
        bit_patterns.add(pattern)
    return len(bit_patterns)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))
```

This corrected version uses a set to store unique bit patterns of the numbers considering only the last 31 bits. The number of unique patterns gives the minimum number of groups required. Each number is added to the set after masking out all bits except the last 31 bits. The length of the set at the end gives the number of unique groups needed.

Since the original code does not correctly implement the logic described above, it is incorrect.
