The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `res` is 0, so after the operation, `res` becomes 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `count`, `num`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `res` is 1, `count` is a dictionary with the key `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` incremented by 1, and `num` is not in `count` unless it was already a key in `count` before the operation.**
