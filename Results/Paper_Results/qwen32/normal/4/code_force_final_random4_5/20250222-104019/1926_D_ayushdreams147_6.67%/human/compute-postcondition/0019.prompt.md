Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31; `res` is 0; `count` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    if num not in count:
        count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
        res += 1
    else:
        count[num] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31. If `num` was not in `count`, then `res` is 1 and `count` has the key `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` incremented by 1. If `num` was already in `count`, then `res` is 0 and the value of `count[num]` has been decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `num` is the next element in the list `a`. If `num` was not in `count`, `res` is set to 2 or 1 depending on the previous iteration, and `count` is updated to increment the count of `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 1 or 0 depending on the previous iteration, and `count[num]` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `num` is the next element in the list `a`. If `num` is not in `count`, `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1 and `res` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count[num]` is decremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
