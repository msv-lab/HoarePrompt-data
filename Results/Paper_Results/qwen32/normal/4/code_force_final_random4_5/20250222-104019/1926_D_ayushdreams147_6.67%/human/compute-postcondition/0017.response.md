The code snippet `count[num] -= 1` decrements the value associated with the key `num` in the dictionary `count` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` is between 0 and 2^31 - 1, and `num` is the next element in the list `a`, the value of `count[num]` will be decremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `count[num]` is decremented by 1.**
