Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31. If `num` was not in `count`, then `res` is 1 and `count` has the key `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` incremented by 1. If `num` was already in `count`, then `res` is 0 and the value of `count[num]` has been decremented by 1.**
