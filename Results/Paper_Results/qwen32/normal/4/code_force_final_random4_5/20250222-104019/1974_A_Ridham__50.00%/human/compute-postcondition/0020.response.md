The given Python code snippet calculates the value of `extra_screen` based on the previously defined variables. Here's the detailed output state after the execution of the code:

The value of `extra_screen` is computed as `extra_space // 15 + 1`. Since `extra_space` is defined as `space_x - remaining_cells`, and given the initial conditions, the value of `extra_screen` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `space_x` is not divisible by 15, and `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`.**
