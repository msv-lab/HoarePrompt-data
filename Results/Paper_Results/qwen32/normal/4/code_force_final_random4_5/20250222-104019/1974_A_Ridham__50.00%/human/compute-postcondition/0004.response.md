The code snippet assigns the value of `x * 1` to the variable `space_x`. Since `x * 1` is simply `x`, the value of `space_x` becomes equal to the value of `x`. The values of `t`, `y`, `n`, and `result` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list.**
