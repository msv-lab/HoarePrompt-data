The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the loop. The loop will execute `n` times, and the state at the start of the next iteration only needs to reflect the decrement in the loop counter, which is implicitly managed by the `for` loop itself in Python. Therefore, the state of the variables `t`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `n`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, and `remaining_cells` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

However, since `n` is the controlling factor for the loop, it should reflect the decrement in the number of iterations left. Given that the loop is about to start its next iteration, `n` should be decreased by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `n` is greater than 1, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + x`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` where `extra_screen` is `x // 15` if `x` is divisible by 15, or `x // 15 + 1` if `x` is not divisible by 15, and the second element is also `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`. `n` is now `n - 1`.**
