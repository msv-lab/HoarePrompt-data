To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(n):`, meaning the only variable we can adjust is `n`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `result` are not directly relevant to the execution of this specific for loop, as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` must be greater than 0; `result` is an empty list.**
