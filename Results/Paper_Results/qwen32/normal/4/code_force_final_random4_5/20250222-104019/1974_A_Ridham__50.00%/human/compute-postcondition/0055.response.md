Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `n` is now `n - 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. `result` is a list containing three elements. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, all three elements of `result` are `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, the first two elements of `result` are `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` where `extra_screen` is `x // 15` if `x` is divisible by 15, or `x // 15 + 1` if `x` is not divisible by 15, and the third element is also `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.**
