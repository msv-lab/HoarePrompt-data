The code snippet provided modifies the value of `extra_screen`. Initially, `extra_screen` is calculated based on the condition of `x` being divisible by 15 or not. However, the provided code snippet redefines `extra_screen` to be `extra_space // 15 + 1`, which overrides the previous calculation.

Let's break down the changes:
- `extra_screen` is recalculated to be `extra_space // 15 + 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged as per the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `n` is now `n - 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`.**
