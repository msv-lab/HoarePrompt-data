The code snippet appends a new value to the `result` list. The new value is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `result` is originally a list containing one element, `screen_require_for_y`, if `x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, or `[extra_screen + screen_require_for_y]` otherwise.
- The code appends another element to the `result` list, which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.

Therefore, the `result` list now contains two elements:
1. The original value, which is `screen_require_for_y` if `x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` otherwise.
2. The newly appended value, which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `n` is greater than 1, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + x`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `result` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `screen_require_for_y` if `x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` otherwise, and the second element is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.**
