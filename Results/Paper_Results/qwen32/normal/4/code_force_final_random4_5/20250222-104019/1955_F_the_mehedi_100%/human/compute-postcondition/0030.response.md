The code snippet provided reassigns the variable `a` to a new list of integers derived from user input. This means that the original list `a` is replaced with whatever integers the user inputs, separated by spaces. The variables `t` and `cnt` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by user input, `cnt` is either `sum_floor_half_a` or `1 + sum_floor_half_a` where `sum_floor_half_a` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all `x` in the new `a`.**
