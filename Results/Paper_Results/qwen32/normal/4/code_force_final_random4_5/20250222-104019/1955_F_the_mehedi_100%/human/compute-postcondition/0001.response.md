The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
