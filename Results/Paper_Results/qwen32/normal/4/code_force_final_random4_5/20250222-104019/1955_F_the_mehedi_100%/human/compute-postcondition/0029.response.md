The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times based on the input. The loop will execute `int(input())` times, and the state of `t`, `a`, and `cnt` does not directly influence whether the loop can execute again. However, since the question asks to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and there are no such objects to adjust (the underscore `_` is not a state that needs modification), we need to consider the context of the loop's continuation based on the input.

Given that the loop runs for a fixed number of iterations determined by the user input, the states `t`, `a`, and `cnt` do not change the loop's execution count. Therefore, we only need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time based on the input.

Since the loop runs for a fixed number of iterations, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same with respect to the loop head. The only thing that changes is the implicit iteration count, which is managed by the loop itself and not by the variables in the loop head.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by user input, and `cnt` is either `sum_floor_half_a` or `1 + sum_floor_half_a` where `sum_floor_half_a` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all `x` in `a`**
