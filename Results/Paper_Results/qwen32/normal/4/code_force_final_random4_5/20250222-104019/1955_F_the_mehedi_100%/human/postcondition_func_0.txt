The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates a value based on these counts and prints the result. Specifically, it checks if the counts of ones, twos, and threes are all odd, and if so, increments a counter. It then adds half the value of each count (rounded down) to this counter. The function outputs the final counter value for each test case.
