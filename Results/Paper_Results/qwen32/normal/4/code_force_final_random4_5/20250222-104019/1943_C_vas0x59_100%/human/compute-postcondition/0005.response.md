The code snippet `v -= 1` decrements the value of `v` by 1. Given the initial state, `v` is an integer representing a vertex connected by an edge such that `0 <= v < n`. After decrementing `v` by 1, the new value of `v` will be in the range `-1 <= v < n-1`.

However, since `v` originally represented a vertex index, the valid range for `v` after the decrement should be `0 <= v < n-1` to still represent a valid vertex index in the context of the list `u2vs` which contains `n` empty lists.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `u` is an integer representing the vertex connected by an edge such that `0 <= u < n` (after decrementing by 1); `v` is an integer representing the vertex connected by an edge such that `0 <= v < n-1`.**
