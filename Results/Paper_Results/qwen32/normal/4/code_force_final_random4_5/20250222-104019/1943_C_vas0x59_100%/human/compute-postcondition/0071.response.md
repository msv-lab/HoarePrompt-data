To determine what will be printed by `print(len(ops))`, let's analyze the given initial state step by step.

1. **Understanding `path_ba`**:
   - `path_ba` is a list that contains the vertices from `b` to `a` inclusive. The last vertex in the list is `a`, and `previous[a]` is `-1`.
   - The length of `path_ba` can be either odd or even.

2. **Determining `ops`**:
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` remains unchanged (empty).
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing `len(path_ba) // 2` elements, each being a tuple `(c1, i)` or `(c2, i)` where `i` increments by 2 each time.

3. **Calculating `len(ops)`**:
   - If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `len(ops)` is `0` because `ops` remains empty.
   - If `len(path_ba)` is even, `len(ops)` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.

Given the initial state, we do not have the exact length of `path_ba`. However, we know the rule that determines the length of `ops` based on the length of `path_ba`.

To provide the most precise description possible:

- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `len(ops)` will be `0`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even, `len(ops)` will be `len(path_ba) // 2`.

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `len(ops)`. However, we can describe it based on the given conditions.

Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is 0 if the length of path_ba is odd, and len(path_ba) // 2 if the length of path_ba is even)**
