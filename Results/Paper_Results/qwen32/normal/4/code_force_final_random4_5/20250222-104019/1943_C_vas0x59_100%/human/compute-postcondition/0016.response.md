The value of `u` is decremented by 1. Therefore, `u` now holds the value of the input integer decremented by 2. The values of `v`, `u2vs`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u` is the input integer decremented by 2, `v` is the input integer decremented by 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains the values `[v, v]`, the list at index `v` contains the values `[v, v, u]`, and the list at index `w` (for all other `w` not equal to `u` or `v`) contains the values `[w, w]`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.**
