The provided code snippet appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, the values of `c1` and `i` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we can infer that `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]` and `i` is a variable that is not mentioned to be modified or defined within the given context. Therefore, we will assume `i` is a variable whose value is not changed by the code snippet.

Since `ops` was initially an empty list, after the operation, `ops` will contain one element, which is the tuple `(c1, i)`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that tracks the path taken to reach each vertex from vertex `a`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` inclusive, where the last vertex in the list is `a` and `previous[a]` is `-1`; `ops` is a list containing one element `(c1, i)`; the length of `path_ba` is greater than 2; `ci2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ci1` is the integer value of `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`; `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`; `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`.**
