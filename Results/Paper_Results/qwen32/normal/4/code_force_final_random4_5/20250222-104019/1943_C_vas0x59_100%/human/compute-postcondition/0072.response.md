To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Key Points from the Initial State:
- `u2vs` is a list of lists representing the adjacency of vertices in a tree.
- `d` is a list of distances from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree.
- `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, which is not explicitly defined but presumably returns a vertex index.
- `previous` is a list that tracks the path taken to reach each vertex from vertex `a`.
- `b` is also the result of `func_1(d)`, which means `a` and `b` are the same vertex.
- `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` inclusive. The last vertex in the list is `a` and `previous[a]` is `-1`.
- `ops` is a list that gets populated based on the length of `path_ba`:
  - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` remains unchanged (empty).
  - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is populated with tuples `(c1, i)` or `(c2, i)` where `i` increments by 2 each time.
  - `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.
  - `ci1` is `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`.
  - `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`.
  - `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`.

### Analyzing the `print` Statement:
The `print` statement uses `map` to apply a lambda function to each element in `ops`. The lambda function formats each tuple `(x[0] + 1, x[1])` into a string and separates them by newlines.

### Determining the Output:
- If `path_ba` has an odd length, `ops` is empty, so the `print` statement will output nothing.
- If `path_ba` has an even length, `ops` will contain tuples `(c1, i)` or `(c2, i)`. Each tuple will be formatted as `c1 + 1` followed by `i`, and multiple tuples will be separated by newlines.

### Final Answer:
Since the exact contents of `path_ba` and `ops` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the conditions given.

If `path_ba` has an odd length:
Output: **(nothing)**

If `path_ba` has an even length:
Output: **c1+1 i1\nc2+1 i2\n...**
   - Where `c1, c2, ...` are elements from `path_ba` and `i1, i2, ...` are indices incrementing by 2.

Given that the exact state of `path_ba` and `ops` is not provided, we must consider both possibilities.

Since the task specifies to provide the most precise description possible, we should assume the more general case where `path_ba` could be either odd or even in length. However, since the problem doesn't specify a particular case, we'll consider the case where `path_ba` is even in length for a concrete example.

Output: **c1+1 i1\nc2+1 i2\n...**
   - Where `c1, c2, ...` are elements from `path_ba` and `i1, i2, ...` are indices incrementing by 2.

Since the exact values of `c1, c2, ...` and `i1, i2, ...` are not provided, we can't give a more specific output. So, we'll describe it in a general form.

Output: **c1+1 i1\nc2+1 i2\n... (where c1, c2, ... are elements from path_ba and i1, i2, ... are indices incrementing by 2)**

However, since we need a precise and concrete answer based on the provided information, we'll assume the simplest non-trivial case where `path_ba` has exactly 2 elements (the minimum even length), making `ops` contain one tuple `(c1, 0)`.

Output: **c1+1 0**

Given the lack of specific values for `c1`, we can't provide a numerical output, so we'll describe it in terms of `c1`.

Output: **c1+1 0 (where c1 is the element from path_ba)**

Since `c1` is not provided, we'll generalize it as `path_ba[0]`.

Output: **path_ba[0]+1 0**

Thus, the final answer considering the most concrete non-trivial case is:

Output: **path_ba[0]+1 0**
