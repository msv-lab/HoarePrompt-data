Postcondition: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that tracks the path taken to reach each vertex from vertex `a`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, previous[b], n]`. If `n` is `-1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
