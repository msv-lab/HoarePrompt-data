For the given task, we need to ensure that the `for` loop can execute based on the state of the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`, which means the loop will iterate `t` times.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer input representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute at least once. Since `t` is already within the valid range, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself.

The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are mentioned as "yet to be assigned values," but they do not appear in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The loop will execute `t` times regardless of the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Therefore, the state does not need any adjustments for the loop to execute. The state remains as it is, with `t` already being a valid integer within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer input representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are yet to be assigned values**
