Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input representing the number of test cases minus 2, where 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 2; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers input from the user. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition of the if statement is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition of the else statement is satisfied.**

In simpler terms: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the if block's condition is met. Otherwise, the else block's condition is met.**
