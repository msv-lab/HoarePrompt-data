Let's analyze the provided program and determine if it correctly computes the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns under the given promotion rules.

### Reasoning:

The program's logic is based on the following conditions:
1. **If `b <= a`:**
   - Selling at the modified price would not be beneficial because the price of the first bun (`b`) is less than or equal to the usual price (`a`). Therefore, it makes sense to sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The profit is `n * a`.

2. **If `b - a >= n`:**
   - The difference between the initial modified price (`b`) and the usual price (`a`) is greater than or equal to the number of buns (`n`). This means that the price of the first `n` buns can be reduced down to `b - (n - 1)`, which is still greater than or equal to `a`.
   - The profit can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \(\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (2b - n + 1)\).

3. **Otherwise (`b - a < n`):**
   - This means that selling all `n` buns at the modified price isn't optimal because the price of the `n`-th bun would drop below the usual price `a`.
   - We should sell the first `k` buns at the modified price, where `k` is the point at which the modified price becomes less than or equal to the usual price `a`. This `k` is equal to `b - a`.
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series: \(\text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (b + (b - k + 1))\).
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `a * (n - k)` to the profit.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts: \(\text{Profit} = \frac{k}{2} \times (2b - k + 1) + a \times (n - k)\).

### Verification Against the Example:

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - Since `b > a` and `b - a < n`, we use the formula for `k = b - a = 1`.
   - Profit: \(\frac{1}{2} \times (5 + 5 - 1 + 1) + 4 \times (4 - 1) = 5 + 12 = 17\).

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, we use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - Profit: \(\frac{5}{2} \times (2 \times 9 - 5 + 1) = \frac{5}{2} \times 14 = 35\).

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
   - Since `b <= a`, we sell all buns at the usual price.
   - Profit: \(10 \times 10 = 100\).

The program's logic correctly handles these cases and others as per the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program correctly computes the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns under the given promotion rules.

**Correctness: True**
