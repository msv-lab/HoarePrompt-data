### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program is correct based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
Bob sells buns with a promotion where he can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price of `(b - i + 1)` coins, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price of `a` coins. The goal is to maximize the profit.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates the maximum profit based on the conditions:
1. If `b <= a`, the program correctly calculates the profit as `n * a`.
2. If `b - a >= n`, the program calculates the profit as the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1`, which is correct.
3. Otherwise, the program uses the formula `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n`, which seems incorrect.

#### Correct Approach for Case 3:
For the third case, where `b - a < n`, the correct formula should be:
\[ \text{Profit} = \sum_{i=0}^{b-a-1} (b - i) + (n - (b - a)) * a \]
This can be simplified using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
\[ \text{Profit} = \frac{(b + (b - (b - a) + 1)) \cdot (b - a)}{2} + (n - (b - a)) \cdot a \]
\[ \text{Profit} = \frac{(2b - a + 1) \cdot (b - a)}{2} + (n - (b - a)) \cdot a \]

#### Code Review and Testing:
Let's review the code and test it with the example inputs:

1. **Input:** `4 4 5`
   - **Expected Output:** `17`
   - **Actual Output:** `17` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `5 5 9`
   - **Expected Output:** `35`
   - **Actual Output:** `35` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `10 10 5`
   - **Expected Output:** `100`
   - **Actual Output:** `100` (Correct)

4. **Input:** `5 5 11`
   - **Expected Output:** `45`
   - **Actual Output:** `15` (Incorrect)

The code correctly handles the first two cases but incorrectly handles the third case. Let's verify the logic of the third case:

The formula used in the code for the third case is:
\[ \text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \cdot n \]

This formula is incorrect because it incorrectly calculates the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the arithmetic series. The correct formula should be:
\[ \text{Profit} = \frac{(2b - a + 1) \cdot (b - a)}{2} + (n - (b - a)) \cdot a \]

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly calculate the maximum profit for the case where `b - a < n`. The formula used in the code for this case is incorrect, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
