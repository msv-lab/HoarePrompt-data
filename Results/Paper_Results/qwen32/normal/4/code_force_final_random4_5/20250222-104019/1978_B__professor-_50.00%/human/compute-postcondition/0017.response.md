Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input representing the number of test cases minus 1, where 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers input from the user. If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the condition of the if statement is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition of the else statement is satisfied. In both cases, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
