Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is the new input string, `j` is `i + 2`, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues to execute without any changes to the variables. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
