The code snippet `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1` finds the index of the character `d[j]` in the string `e` and adds 1 to it. Given that `j` is 2, the character `d[j]` is the third character of the string `d` (since indexing starts at 0).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` and `a` are integers obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are strings obtained from the input; `j` is 2; `k` is the index of the third character of `d` in `e` plus 1.**
