Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `i + 2`; `i` is `i + 1`. If `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, then `k` is set to `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged.**
