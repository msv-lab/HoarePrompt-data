Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` and `c` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `d` is a string obtained from the input; `e` is a string obtained from the input; `k` is 0.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values except for `k`, which is now set to 0.
