Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`. If the character at position `j` in string `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from position `k`, then `k` is incremented by 1 if `k` did not equal `c` and `j` did not equal `b - 1`. Additionally, either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is set to `j` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
