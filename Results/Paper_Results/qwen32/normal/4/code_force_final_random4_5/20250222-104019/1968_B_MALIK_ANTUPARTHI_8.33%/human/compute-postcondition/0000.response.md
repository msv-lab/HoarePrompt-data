The code snippet `a = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, then assigns this integer value to the variable `a`. The initial state specifies that `a` was a binary string of length `n`. After the execution of the code, `a` is no longer a binary string but an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, and the preconditions related to them remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer; `b` is a binary string of length `m`; the sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of values `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**
