Postcondition: **`j` is `j + 1`. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, `k` is set to `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `k` is set to `e.index(d[j]) + 1`. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
