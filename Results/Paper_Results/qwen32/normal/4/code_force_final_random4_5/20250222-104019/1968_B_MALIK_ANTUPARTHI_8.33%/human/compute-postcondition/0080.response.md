Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is the new input string, `j` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `e` is the value of the input, and `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`. Additionally, either `k` is equal to `j + 1` or `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`.**
