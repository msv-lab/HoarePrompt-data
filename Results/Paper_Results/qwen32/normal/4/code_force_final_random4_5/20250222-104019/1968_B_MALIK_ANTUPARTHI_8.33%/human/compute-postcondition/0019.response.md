The value of `k` is updated to `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 1, `k` will now be 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `a`, `d`, `e`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are strings obtained from the input; `j` is 1; `k` is 2.**
