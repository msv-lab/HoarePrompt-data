Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` and `a` are integers obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are strings obtained from the input; `j` is 2; `k` is 2; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `c`, `a`, `d`, `e`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The only impact of the code is that it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
