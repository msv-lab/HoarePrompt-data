The code snippet `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list in the `mp` dictionary at the key `pf[i]`. Given the initial state, we know that `i` is `n + 1`, and `pf[i]` is `pf[n + 1]`.

From the initial state:
- `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i - 1]` which is the integer value of `data[3]` and `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ data[4]`.
- Therefore, `pf[n + 1]` is `pf[n] ^ data[4]`.

Since `mp[pf[n + 1]]` initially contains only `i` (which is `n + 1`), after executing the code, `mp[pf[n + 1]]` will be `[n + 1, n + 1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is the integer value of `data[4]`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is 5; `results` is an empty list; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i - 1]` which is the integer value of `data[3]` and `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ data[4]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `mp[0]` is `[0]`, and `mp[data[3]]` is `[i]`, and `mp[pf[n + 1]]` is `[n + 1, n + 1]`; `i` is `n + 1`.**
