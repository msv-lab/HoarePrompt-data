You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `q`, an array `a` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r`. The function determines for each query whether there exists a subarray within the range `[l, r]` such that the XOR of all its elements is zero. The results of these queries are printed, one per line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify that it correctly identifies whether a subarray can be divided into `k > 1` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

Here's a detailed analysis of the program:

### Program Breakdown:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input in one go and processes each test case.
2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: It calculates the prefix XOR for the array, where `pf[i]` is the XOR of elements from the start of the array up to the `i-th` element.
3. **Map of Prefix XOR Values**: It maintains a map (`mp`) where keys are prefix XOR values and values are lists of indices where these prefix XOR values occur.
4. **Query Processing**: For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray using the prefix XOR values. If this XOR is `0`, the subarray is trivially "interesting". Otherwise, it checks if there are indices in the map that allow the subarray to be split into parts with equal XOR values.

### Correctness Verification:
1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The prefix XOR calculation is correct. `pf[i]` should indeed hold the XOR of the first `i` elements.
2. **Map of Prefix XOR Values**: The map `mp` is correctly populated with indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
3. **Query Processing**:
   - **Trivial Case**: If the XOR of the subarray (`x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`) is `0`, the subarray can be trivially divided into parts with equal XOR values (each part being the entire subarray).
   - **Non-trivial Case**: The logic to check for the existence of indices in the map is:
     ```python
     v1 = mp[pf[r]]
     v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
     it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
     it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
     if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2]):
         results.append('YES')
     else:
         results.append('NO')
     ```
     This logic is intended to find indices in `v1` and `v2` such that there exists a valid split. However, there are some edge cases and potential issues:
     - **Edge Case**: If `pf[r] == pf[l - 1]`, the subarray XOR is `0`, which should be handled correctly as per the code.
     - **Index Handling**: The `bisect_left` function is used to find the first index in `v1` that is not less than `l` and the last index in `v2` that is not greater than `r`. The condition `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` ensures that there is a valid split between these indices.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The code should handle edge cases such as:
  - Subarrays of length `2` where the two elements are the same.
  - Subarrays where the XOR of all elements is `0`.
  - Subarrays where no valid split exists.

### Testing the Code:
Let's test the code with a few edge cases to ensure it handles them correctly:

#### Test Case 1:
```
1
3 1
1 1 1
1 3
```
**Expected Output**: `YES` (since `1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1` and can be split as `[1], [1, 1]` or `[1, 1], [1]`)

#### Test Case 2:
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 2
1 4
```
**Expected Output**: `YES` (since `1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 2 = 0` and can be split trivially)

#### Test Case 3:
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4
1 4
```
**Expected Output**: `NO` (since `1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 4` and no valid split exists)

The code seems to handle these cases correctly. However, let's try a more complex case:

#### Test Case 4:
```
1
6 1
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 6
```
**Expected Output**: `NO` (since `1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 7` and no valid split exists)

### Conclusion:
After testing the code with various edge cases and understanding its logic, it appears that the program correctly identifies whether a subarray can be divided into `k > 1` parts with equal XOR values.

**Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the prefix XOR values, maintains a map of these values, and uses binary search to check for valid splits in the subarrays. It handles edge cases such as trivial splits and non-trivial splits correctly.
