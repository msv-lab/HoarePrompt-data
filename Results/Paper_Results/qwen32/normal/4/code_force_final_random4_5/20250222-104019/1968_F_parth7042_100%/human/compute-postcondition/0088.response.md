Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[index])`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `n + 6`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO'); `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `mp` is a defaultdict with the key `0` mapping to the list `[0]`.**

The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing it from `n + 5` to `n + 6`. All other variables remain unchanged.
