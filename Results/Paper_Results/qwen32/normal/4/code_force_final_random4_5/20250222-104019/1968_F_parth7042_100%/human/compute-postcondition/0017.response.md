The code snippet `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list stored in `mp` at the key `pf[i]`. Given the initial state, `pf[i]` is the integer value of `data[3]`, and `i` is a specific index where `a[i]` and `pf[i]` have the value of `data[3]`.

Since `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, if `mp[pf[i]]` does not exist, it will be initialized as an empty list before appending `i`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is the integer value of `data[3]`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is 4; `results` is an empty list; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the integer value of `data[3]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `mp[0]` is `[0]`, and `mp[data[3]]` is `[i]`.**

In natural language: The value of `i` is appended to the list in `mp` at the key `data[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
