The code snippet `a[i] = int(data[index])` updates the value of the `i`-th element in the list `a` to the integer value of `data[index]`. 

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `data`, `index`, `results`, `pf`, and `mp` remain unchanged. The only change is in the list `a`, where the element at index `i` is updated.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[index])`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `n + 5`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO'); `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `mp` is a defaultdict with the key `0` mapping to the list `[0]`**.
