Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` is the integer value of `data[2n + 2q + 3]`; `q` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the integers read from `data` starting at `index`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `2n + 2q + 10 + n`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO'). If `x` is 0, 'YES' is appended to `results`. `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[0]` is 0 and `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the cumulative XOR values of `a` up to that index; `mp` is a defaultdict where each key is a unique XOR value in `pf` and maps to a list of indices where that XOR value was achieved; `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` is 0, then 'YES' is appended to `results`. `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element not less than `l` is found; `it2` is the index in `v2` where the first element not greater than `r` is found minus 1`. If `x` is not 0 and `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and the element at `v1[it1]` is less than the element at `v2[it2]`, then 'YES' is appended to `results`. Otherwise, 'NO' is appended to `results`. The loop continues to the next iteration without changing any other variables.`**

In natural language: The variable `v1` is now assigned the list of indices from the defaultdict `mp` where the key is the cumulative XOR value `pf[r]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
