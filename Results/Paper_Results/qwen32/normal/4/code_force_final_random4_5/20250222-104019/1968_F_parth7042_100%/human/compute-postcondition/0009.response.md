The code snippet `a = [0] * (n + 1)` creates a new list `a` with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to `0`. The value of `n` is taken from the initial state, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `a` was previously defined in the initial state, it is now reassigned to this new list.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `data` is unchanged, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list**.
