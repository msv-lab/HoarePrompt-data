The code snippet assigns the integer value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `r`. The value of `index` is `n + 3`, so `r` is assigned the integer value of `data[n + 4]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the integer values of `data[3]` to `data[n + 2]`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `n + 3`; `results` is an empty list; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[0]` is 0 and `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `mp[0]` is `[0]`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR up to that point; `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`.**
