The provided code snippet is:

```python
mp = defaultdict(list)
```

This line of code reassigns the variable `mp` to a new `defaultdict` with `list` as the default factory. This means that any new key accessed in `mp` will automatically have an empty list as its value.

Given the initial state, the variable `mp` was already a `defaultdict` with specific initial values. However, this line of code overwrites the existing `mp` with a new, empty `defaultdict`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `n + 5`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO'); `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and no initial key-value pairs.**
