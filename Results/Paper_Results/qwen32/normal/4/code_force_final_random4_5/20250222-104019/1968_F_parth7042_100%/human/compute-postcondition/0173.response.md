The code snippet appends the current index `i` to the list associated with the key `pf[i]` in the defaultdict `mp`. Given that `i` is 3 and `pf[3]` is 0, the value 3 will be appended to the list `mp[0]`.

Thus, the defaultdict `mp` will be updated such that `mp[0]` now contains `[3]` instead of `[3]` (it already contains 3, so it will be `[3, 3]`).

Here is the updated Output State:
Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[2]` which is `int(data[index])` and `a[3]` which is `int(data[index])`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `2n + 2q + 10`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO'); `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[2]` which is `int(data[index])` and `pf[3]` which is `0`; `mp` is a defaultdict where each key is a unique XOR value from `pf` and maps to a list of indices `i` where that XOR value was achieved, and `mp[int(data[index])]` is now `[2]` and `mp[0]` is `[3, 3]`; `i` is 3.**
