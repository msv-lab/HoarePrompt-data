The code snippet `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list in the `mp` dictionary that corresponds to the key `pf[i]`. Given that `i` is 2 and `pf[2]` is `int(data[index])`, the list that `mp[int(data[index])]` maps to will now include `2`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[2]` which is `int(data[index])`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `2n + 2q + 9`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO'); `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[2]` which is `int(data[index])`; `mp` is a defaultdict where each key is a unique XOR value from `pf` and maps to a list of indices `i` where that XOR value was achieved, and `mp[int(data[index])]` is now `[2]`; `i` is 2**
