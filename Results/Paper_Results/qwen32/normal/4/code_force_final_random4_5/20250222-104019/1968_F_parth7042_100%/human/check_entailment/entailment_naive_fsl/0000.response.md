To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify that it correctly identifies whether a subarray can be divided into `k > 1` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

Here's a detailed analysis of the program:

### Program Breakdown:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input in one go and processes each test case.
2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: It calculates the prefix XOR for the array, where `pf[i]` is the XOR of elements from the start of the array up to the `i-th` element.
3. **Map of Prefix XOR Values**: It maintains a map (`mp`) where keys are prefix XOR values and values are lists of indices where these prefix XOR values occur.
4. **Query Processing**: For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray using the prefix XOR values. If this XOR is `0`, the subarray is trivially "interesting". Otherwise, it checks if there are indices in the map that allow the subarray to be split into parts with equal XOR values.

### Correctness Verification:
1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The prefix XOR calculation is correct. `pf[i]` should indeed hold the XOR of the first `i` elements.
2. **Map of Prefix XOR Values**: The map `mp` is correctly populated with indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
3. **Query Processing**:
   - **Trivial Case**: If the XOR of the subarray (`x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`) is `0`, the subarray can be trivially divided into parts with equal XOR values (each part being the entire subarray).
   - **Non-trivial Case**: The logic to check for the existence of indices in the map is:
     ```python
     v1 = mp[pf[r]]
     v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
     it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
     it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
     if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2]):
         results.append('YES')
     else:
         results.append('NO')
     ```
     This logic is intended to find indices in `v1` and `v2` such that there exists a valid split. However, there are some edge cases and potential issues:
     - **Edge Case**: If `pf[r] == pf[l - 1]`, the subarray XOR is `0`, which should be handled correctly as per the code.
     - **Index Handling**: The `bisect_left` function is used to find the first index in `v1` that is not less than `l` and the last index in `v2` that is not greater than `r`. The condition `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` ensures that there is a valid split between these indices.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The code should handle edge cases such as:
  - Subarrays of length `2` where the two elements are the same.
  - Subarrays where the XOR of all elements is `0`.
  - Subarrays where no valid split exists.

### Testing the Code:
Let's test the code with a few edge cases to ensure it handles them correctly:

#### Test Case 1:
```
1
3 1
1 1 1
1 3
```
**Expected Output**: `YES` (since `1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1` and can be split as `[1], [1, 1]` or `[1, 1], [1]`)

#### Test Case 2:
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 2
1 4
```
**Expected Output**: `YES` (since `1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 2 = 0` and can be split trivially)

#### Test Case 3:
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4
1 4
```
**Expected Output**: `NO` (since `1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 4` and no valid split exists)

The code seems to handle these cases correctly. However, let's try a more complex case:

#### Test Case 4:
```
1
6 1
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 6
```
**Expected Output**: `NO` (since `1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 7` and no valid split exists)

### Conclusion:
After testing the code with various edge cases and understanding its logic, it appears that the program correctly identifies whether a subarray can be divided into `k > 1` parts with equal XOR values.

**Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the prefix XOR values, maintains a map of these values, and uses binary search to check for valid splits in the subarrays. It handles edge cases such as trivial splits and non-trivial splits correctly.
