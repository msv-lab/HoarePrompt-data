Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, `q` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `mn` is 100. If `a < b > c`, then the condition holds true; otherwise, the condition does not hold true, meaning `b` is not greater than both `a` and `c`.**
