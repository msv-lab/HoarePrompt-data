The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, `q` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `mn` is 100. The condition `a < b > c` is checked but not altered by this code snippet.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated to the integers provided by the input. The values of `t`, `q`, `i`, and `mn` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, `q` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `mn` is 100.**
