The `print('PEAK')` statement in the provided code snippet is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string 'PEAK' regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`, and `mn`. The initial state provides information about these variables but does not influence the output of this particular print statement.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The print statement is `print('PEAK')`.
2. The string 'PEAK' is explicitly provided within the print statement.
3. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`, and `mn` do not affect the output of this print statement because they are not referenced within it.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string 'PEAK'.

Output: **PEAK**
