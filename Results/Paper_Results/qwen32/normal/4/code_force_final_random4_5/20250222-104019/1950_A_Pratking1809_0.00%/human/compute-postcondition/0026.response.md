Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input from the last iteration, `q` is an integer representing the total number of iterations that have occurred, `i` is equal to `q - 1` (since `i` will be `q-1` after the loop has completed all `q` iterations), and `mn` is 100. No changes are made to `t`, `mn`, or any other variables outside of the loop body. The loop has finished executing all `q` iterations.**

In simpler terms: After the loop has finished executing all `q` iterations, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, `mn` remains 100, and `i` will be equal to `q - 1`, reflecting the last iteration index. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be those from the last input provided to the loop.
