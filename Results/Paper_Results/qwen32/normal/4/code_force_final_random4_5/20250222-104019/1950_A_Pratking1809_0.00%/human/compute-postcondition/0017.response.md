The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NONE'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`, `mn`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables and will always output the string `'NONE'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes the variables and their conditions.
2. The `print` statement is `print('NONE')`.
3. The string `'NONE'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement and does not depend on any of the variables.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NONE**
