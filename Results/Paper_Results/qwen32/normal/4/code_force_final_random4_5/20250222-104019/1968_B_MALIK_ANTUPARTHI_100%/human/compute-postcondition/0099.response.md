The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables; it only affects the control flow by exiting the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the provided context, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the user's input, `e` is the user's input, `k` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
