Postcondition: **`j` is 0, `k` is the index of `d[0]` in `e` plus 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the user's input, `e` is the user's input, and `d[j]` (which is `d[0]`) is in the sublist `e[k-1:]`. Additionally, either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`.**
