Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is the value of the first integer from the user input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the value of the second integer from the user input, `d` is the value of the string input by the user, `e` is the value of the user input, `j` is 0, and `k` is 1-based index of the first occurrence of `d[0]` in `e`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables.**
