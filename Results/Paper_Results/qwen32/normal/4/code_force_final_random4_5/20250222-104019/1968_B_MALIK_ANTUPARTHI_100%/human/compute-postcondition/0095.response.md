The value of `k` is updated to `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 2, `k` becomes `2 + 1`, which is `3`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the user's input, `e` is the user's input, `k` is 3.**
