The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `b`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to be the value it would have at the start of the next iteration, which is `0` (since the loop starts from `0` and increments `j` by `1` in each iteration).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is the value of the first integer from the user input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the value of the second integer from the user input, `d` is the value of the string input by the user, `e` is the value of the user input, `j` is 0**
