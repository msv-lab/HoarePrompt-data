The code snippet updates the value of `k` based on the index of the character `d[j]` in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`. Here's the updated state:

- `k` is incremented by the index of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus 1.

Given this, the new value of `k` will be its previous value plus the position of `d[j]` in the substring of `e` starting from `k` plus 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is the value of the first integer from the user input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the value of the second integer from the user input, `d` is the value of the string input by the user, `e` is the value of the user input, `k` is updated to `k + e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1`.**
