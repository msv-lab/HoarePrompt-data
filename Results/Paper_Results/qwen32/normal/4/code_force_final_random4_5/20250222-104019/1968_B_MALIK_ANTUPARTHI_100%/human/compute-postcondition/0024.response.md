Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is the value of the user input, `e` is the value of the user input, and `j` is `j_old + 1` where `j_old` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to `j + 1` if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `k` is set to `j`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
