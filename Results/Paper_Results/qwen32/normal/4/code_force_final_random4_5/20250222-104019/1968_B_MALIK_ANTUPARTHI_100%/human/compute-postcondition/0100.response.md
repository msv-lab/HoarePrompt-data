Postcondition: **`j` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the user's input, `e` is the user's input. If `d[2]` is found in `e[k:]`, `k` is updated to its position in `e` starting from index `k` plus 1, plus `k`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of with `k` set to 3. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables. If `d[2]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to 2 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
