Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is the value of the first integer from the user input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the value of the second integer from the user input, `d` is the value of the string input by the user, `e` is the value of the user input, `k` is updated to `j + 1`. The current value of `k` is equal to `c` or the current value of `j` is equal to `b - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is now `j + 1`. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
