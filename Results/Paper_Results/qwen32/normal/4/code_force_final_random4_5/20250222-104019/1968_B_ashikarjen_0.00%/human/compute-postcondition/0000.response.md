The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, and `a` and `b` are binary strings of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively. However, the input operation in the code snippet does not affect `t`, `a`, or `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` and `b` are binary strings of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.**
