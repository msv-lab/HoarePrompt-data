The `print('YES')` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables or objects described in the initial state. The initial state provides information about the variables `tests`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `slength`, and `x`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
