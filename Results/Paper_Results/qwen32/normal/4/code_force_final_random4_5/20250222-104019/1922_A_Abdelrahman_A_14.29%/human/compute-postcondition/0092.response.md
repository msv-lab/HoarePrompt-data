The function `func` accepts an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function processes these inputs and returns a value for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. It returns a value for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
