Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

The current logic incorrectly assumes that if any character in c is not in a or b, then a template exists that matches a and b but not c. However, the problem requires a more nuanced approach to ensure that the template conditions are met for all positions in the strings.

Here's a correct approach to solve the problem:

1. For each position in the strings, check if the characters in a and b are the same or different.
2. Construct a template based on these observations:
   - If the characters in a and b are the same, the template character must be the uppercase version of that character (to exclude c).
   - If the characters in a and b are different, the template character can be the uppercase version of one of them (ensuring it excludes the other).
3. Check if string c does not match this template.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        
        # Construct the template
        template = []
        for j in range(slength):
            if a[j] == b[j]:
                # If a[j] == b[j], then c[j] must be different from a[j]
                template.append(a[j].upper())
            else:
                # If a[j] != b[j], then c[j] must be different from either a[j] or b[j]
                template.append(a[j].upper())
        
        # Check if c matches the template
        matches = True
        for j in range(slength):
            if template[j].isupper() and c[j] == template[j].lower():
                matches = False
                break
        
        if matches:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the template is constructed correctly and checks if c does not match the template as required by the problem statement.
