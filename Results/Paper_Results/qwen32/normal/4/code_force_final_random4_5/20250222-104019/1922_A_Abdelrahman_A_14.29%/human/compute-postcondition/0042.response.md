Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we need to determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement executes.

Let's break down the initial state:
- `tests` is greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
- `a` is a new input string.
- `b` is a new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `c` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character.
- `i` is 1.
- `slength` is a new input integer.
- `no` is True.
- `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state are used within this print statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly given by the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
