You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of constraints on an integer `k`. For each test case, it determines the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints and outputs the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program contains a logical error in the handling of constraints. Specifically, the program fails to correctly account for cases where the range defined by the constraints of type 1 and 2 is invalid or where constraints of type 3 fall within the valid range.

Let's analyze the problematic part of the code:

```python
if bx > ax:
    r.append(0)
else:
    tmp = 0
    for i in cx:
        if i >= bx and i <= ax:
            tmp += 1
    r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
```

The issue arises in the `else` block. The program calculates the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` and then subtracts the count of integers that are not allowed by constraints of type 3. However, the range `[bx, ax]` should be calculated as `ax - bx + 1` only if `bx <= ax`. If `bx > ax`, the range is invalid, and the result should be `0`. The code correctly handles this in the `if bx > ax:` block, but the `else` block does not correctly handle cases where `cx` contains values that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.

Let's consider the following test case:

```
1
3
1 5
2 3
3 4
```

In this case, `bx` becomes `5` and `ax` becomes `3`. Since `bx > ax`, the program correctly appends `0` to the result list. However, if we slightly modify the test case:

```
1
3
1 3
2 5
3 4
```

Here, `bx` is `3` and `ax` is `5`, which is valid. The range `[3, 5]` includes the number `4`, which is not allowed by the constraint of type 3. The program should correctly calculate the number of valid integers in the range, which is `2` (the numbers `3` and `5`). However, the program will incorrectly calculate it as `3` (the numbers `3`, `4`, and `5`) and then subtract `1` for the number `4`, resulting in `2`. This part of the logic is correct, but the issue arises when `cx` contains values outside the range `[bx, ax]`, which the program does not handle correctly.

However, the main issue is when `cx` contains values that are outside the range `[bx, ax]`. In the given code, the program still attempts to subtract these values from the range, which is incorrect. For example:

```
1
3
1 3
2 5
3 7
```

Here, `bx` is `3` and `ax` is `5`, which is valid. The range `[3, 5]` does not include the number `7`, so the program should correctly calculate the number of valid integers in the range, which is `3` (the numbers `3`, `4`, and `5`). However, the program will still attempt to subtract `1` for the number `7`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should only consider values of `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` when calculating `tmp`. The current implementation is incorrect in this regard.

Thus, the program is incorrect due to this logical error.
