The code snippet `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`, respectively. This means the values of `a` and `x` will be updated based on the input provided. The initial state of `a` and `x` are overwritten.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`) remain unchanged unless their values depend on `a` or `x`. Since the new values of `a` and `x` are directly assigned from the input, the definitions of `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` will need to be recalculated based on these new values.

However, the task requires us to only update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code, and explicitly state the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `a` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the value `x`; `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)` if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1.**
