Output State: **`bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2 and must have at least 2 elements, `t` is at least 1, `n` is the number of iterations, `i` is the next element in `cx`, `tmp` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `tmp` has been increased by 1. All other variables (`bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
