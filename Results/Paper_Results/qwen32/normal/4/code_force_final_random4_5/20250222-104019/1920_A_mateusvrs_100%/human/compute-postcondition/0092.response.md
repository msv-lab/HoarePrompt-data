Postcondition: **`bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2 and must have at least 1 element, `t` is at least 1, `n` is the number of iterations, `i` is the next element in `cx`. If `i` is between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, `tmp` is incremented by 1.**
