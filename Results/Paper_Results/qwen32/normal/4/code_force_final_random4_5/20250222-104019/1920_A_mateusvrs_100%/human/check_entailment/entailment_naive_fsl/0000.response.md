Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program contains a logical error in the handling of constraints. Specifically, the program fails to correctly account for cases where the range defined by the constraints of type 1 and 2 is invalid or where constraints of type 3 fall within the valid range.

Let's analyze the problematic part of the code:

```python
if bx > ax:
    r.append(0)
else:
    tmp = 0
    for i in cx:
        if i >= bx and i <= ax:
            tmp += 1
    r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
```

The issue arises in the `else` block. The program calculates the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` and then subtracts the count of integers that are not allowed by constraints of type 3. However, the range `[bx, ax]` should be calculated as `ax - bx + 1` only if `bx <= ax`. If `bx > ax`, the range is invalid, and the result should be `0`. The code correctly handles this in the `if bx > ax:` block, but the `else` block does not correctly handle cases where `cx` contains values that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.

Let's consider the following test case:

```
1
3
1 5
2 3
3 4
```

In this case, `bx` becomes `5` and `ax` becomes `3`. Since `bx > ax`, the program correctly appends `0` to the result list. However, if we slightly modify the test case:

```
1
3
1 3
2 5
3 4
```

Here, `bx` is `3` and `ax` is `5`, which is valid. The range `[3, 5]` includes the number `4`, which is not allowed by the constraint of type 3. The program should correctly calculate the number of valid integers in the range, which is `2` (the numbers `3` and `5`). However, the program will incorrectly calculate it as `3` (the numbers `3`, `4`, and `5`) and then subtract `1` for the number `4`, resulting in `2`. This part of the logic is correct, but the issue arises when `cx` contains values outside the range `[bx, ax]`, which the program does not handle correctly.

However, the main issue is when `cx` contains values that are outside the range `[bx, ax]`. In the given code, the program still attempts to subtract these values from the range, which is incorrect. For example:

```
1
3
1 3
2 5
3 7
```

Here, `bx` is `3` and `ax` is `5`, which is valid. The range `[3, 5]` does not include the number `7`, so the program should correctly calculate the number of valid integers in the range, which is `3` (the numbers `3`, `4`, and `5`). However, the program will still attempt to subtract `1` for the number `7`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should only consider values of `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` when calculating `tmp`. The current implementation is incorrect in this regard.

Thus, the program is incorrect due to this logical error.
