The code snippet `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `x`. 

Given the initial state, `bx` is initially set to the maximum of `x` and -1. After executing the code, `bx` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `x`. Since `bx` was already the maximum of `x` and -1, the new value of `bx` will be `x` if `x` is greater than the current `bx`, otherwise, it will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the new value of `bx` will be `max(x, max(x, -1))`, which simplifies to `x`.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is `x`, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` remains 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` contains the value `x`, `t` is at least 1 and `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is at least 2 and `n` is `n - 1`, `r` contains elements as per its initial condition or previous updates.**
