The provided code snippet only initializes a variable `tmp` to 0, without affecting any of the other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `t` is at least 1, and `n` is the number of iterations. Additionally, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 0.**
