Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `cx` is a set containing the value `x`; `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `1000000007`; `bx` is max(x, -1) if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1; `a` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input.**

In natural language: The set `cx` now contains the value `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
