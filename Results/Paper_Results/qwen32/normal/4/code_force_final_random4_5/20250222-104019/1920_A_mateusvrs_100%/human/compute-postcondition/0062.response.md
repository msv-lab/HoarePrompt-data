The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `x`. Given that `ax` is initially 1000000007 and `x` is the second integer from the input, the new value of `ax` will be the smaller of these two numbers.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we can only describe the possible outcomes based on the comparison:
- If `x` is less than or equal to 1000000007, then `ax` will be updated to the value of `x`.
- If `x` is greater than 1000000007, `ax` will remain 1000000007.

The other variables (`a`, `bx`, `t`, `n`, and `cx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is equal to 2, `bx` is -1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 1, `cx` is an empty set, and `x` is the second integer from the input.**
