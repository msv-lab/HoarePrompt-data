Postcondition: **`bx` is -1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007. `t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 1, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`. `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, and `a` is not equal to 1.**
