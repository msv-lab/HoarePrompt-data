Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 2, `cx` is a set containing `x`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Initially, `cx` was an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise it contained `x`. After executing the code, `cx` will definitely contain `x`. The values of `a`, `x`, `bx`, `ax`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.
