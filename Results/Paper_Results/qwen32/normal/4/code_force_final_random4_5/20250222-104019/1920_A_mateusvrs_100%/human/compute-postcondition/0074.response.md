The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The loop's execution depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is at least 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0.

Given that the loop variable `_` does not affect the state and `n` controls the number of iterations, we only need to adjust `n` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)`, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007. `t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 1. If `a` is 1 or 2, `cx` is an empty set, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`.**
