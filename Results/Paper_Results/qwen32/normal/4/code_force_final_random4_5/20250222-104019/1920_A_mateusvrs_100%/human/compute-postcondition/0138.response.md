The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`. If `cx` has at least one element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `cx` is a set of all `x` encountered when `a == 3` that must have at least one element. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `cx` must still have at least one element, and `i` should be the next element in `cx`.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `cx`, after the previous iteration, `i` would have taken one value from `cx`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be another element from `cx` if it exists.

State: **`bx` is the maximum `x` encountered when `a == 1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` encountered when `a == 2`, `cx` is a set of all `x` encountered when `a == 3` that must have at least one element, `t` is `t - n`, `n` is 0, `r` remains unchanged, and `tmp` is 1 if the first element in `cx` satisfies `i >= bx` and `i <= ax`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0. `i` is another element from `cx` if it exists.**
