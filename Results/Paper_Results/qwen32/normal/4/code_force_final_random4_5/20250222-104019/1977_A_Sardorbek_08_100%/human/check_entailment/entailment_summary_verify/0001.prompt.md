You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`. It then prints "YES" if `b` is equal to `c`, "NO" if `b` is less than `c`, and "Yes" if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd). Otherwise, it prints "No".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Nikita can perform two types of operations:
1. Add exactly one cube to the tower.
2. Remove exactly one cube from the tower.

We need to determine if it is possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Observations:
- If `n < m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n`.
- If `n >= m`, it is possible to have `m` cubes if the difference `n - m` is even. This is because:
  - Adding a cube increases the count by 1 (odd to even or even to odd).
  - Removing a cube decreases the count by 1 (even to odd or odd to even).
  
  Therefore, to go from 0 to `m` cubes in `n` moves, the number of additions and subtractions must balance out such that the final count is `m`. This is only possible if `n - m` is even.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program has the following logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
3. It then checks:
   - If `n == m`, it prints "YES".
   - If `n < m`, it prints "NO".
   - If `n % 2 == m % 2`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

Let's check if this logic aligns with our observations:
- If `n == m`, it correctly prints "YES" because no additional operations are needed.
- If `n < m`, it correctly prints "NO" because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
- If `n % 2 == m % 2`, it prints "Yes", which is correct because `n - m` being even means it's possible to end up with `m` cubes.
- The else case correctly handles the scenario where `n % 2 != m % 2`, which means `n - m` is odd, making it impossible to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of `m` cubes after `n` moves.
