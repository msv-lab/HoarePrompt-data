### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program and see if it correctly determines whether it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves:

1. **Initial Conditions**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` (number of moves) and `m` (desired number of cubes).

2. **Logic for Each Test Case**:
    - **Case 1**: If `b == c` (i.e., `n == m`), it prints "YES". This is correct because if the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube in each move to achieve exactly `m` cubes.
    - **Case 2**: If `b < c` (i.e., `n < m`), it prints "NO". This is correct because if the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes, it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
    - **Case 3**: If `b % 2 == c % 2` (i.e., `n` and `m` have the same parity), it prints "YES". This is correct because the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves and the number of cubes must match for it to be possible to end up with `m` cubes. For example, if `m` is odd, `n` must be odd to end up with an odd number of cubes, and if `m` is even, `n` must be even.
    - **Case 4**: If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NO". This is correct because if `n` and `m` do not match in parity, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

3. **Example Verification**:
    - **First Test Case**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`. Since `n == m`, the output is "YES".
    - **Second Test Case**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`. Since `n < m`, the output is "NO".
    - **Third Test Case**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`. Since `n` and `m` have the same parity (both odd), the output is "YES".

The logic in the program correctly handles all the cases as per the problem description.
