The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `b` and `c`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, and `m` have certain constraints, but these constraints are not affected by the execution of the code snippet. The values of `b` and `c` are determined by the input, so we cannot specify their exact values without the input, but we know they will be integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is greater than or equal to 1; `b` and `c` are integers provided by the input.**
