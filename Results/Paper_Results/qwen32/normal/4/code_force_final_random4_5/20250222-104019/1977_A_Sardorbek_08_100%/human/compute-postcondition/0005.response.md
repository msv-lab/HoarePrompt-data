The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of the output is not dependent on these variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string 'YES' is explicitly provided in the statement.
3. No variables are used in this `print` statement, so the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q` do not affect the output.

Output: **YES**
