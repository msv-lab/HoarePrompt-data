The code snippet `q = b, c` updates the tuple `q` to contain the current values of `b` and `c`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is greater than or equal to 1; `b` and `c` are integers provided by the input; `q` is a tuple containing the values of `b` and `c`. If `b` equals `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. Otherwise, `b` is not equal to `c`. If `b < c`, `b` is less than `c`. If `b` is greater than `c`, and `b % 2 == c % 2`, `b` and `c` have the same parity; otherwise, they have different parities; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
