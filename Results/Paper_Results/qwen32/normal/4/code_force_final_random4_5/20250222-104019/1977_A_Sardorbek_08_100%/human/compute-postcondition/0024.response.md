Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is greater than or equal to 1; `b` and `c` are integers provided by the input; `q` is a tuple containing the values of `b` and `c`. If `b` equals `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. Otherwise, `b` is not equal to `c`. If `b < c`, `b` is less than `c`. If `b` is greater than `c`, and `b % 2 == c % 2`, `b` and `c` have the same parity; otherwise, they have different parities; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

In simpler terms, the postcondition is: **`t`, `n`, and `m` remain within their specified ranges, `a` is at least 1, `b` and `c` retain their input values, `q` contains the values of `b` and `c`, and `i` is incremented by 1. The relationship between `b` and `c` (whether they are equal, `b` is less than `c`, or they have the same or different parities) is preserved.**
