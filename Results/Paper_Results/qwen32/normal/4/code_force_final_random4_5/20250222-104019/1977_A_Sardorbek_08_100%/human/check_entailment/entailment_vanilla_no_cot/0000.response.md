To determine if the provided program is correct, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube at a time, and we need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

The logic in the provided program is as follows:
1. If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can just keep adding cubes one by one.
2. If `b < c`, it prints 'NO'. This is also correct because if the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, Nikita cannot end up with more cubes than the number of moves he made.
3. If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints 'Yes'. This is correct because if the number of moves and the number of cubes have the same parity (both even or both odd), it's possible to end up with `m` cubes. For example, if `b = 5` and `c = 3`, Nikita can add 3 cubes and remove 2 cubes.
4. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. This is correct because if the number of moves and the number of cubes have different parity, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes.

The program handles all the cases correctly. Therefore, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
