Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is greater than or equal to 1; `b` and `c` are integers provided by the input; `q` is a tuple containing the values of `b` and `c` from the last iteration; If `b` equals `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. Otherwise, `b` is not equal to `c`; If `b < c`, `b` is less than `c`; If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), then `b` and `c` have the same parity; otherwise, they have different parities; `i` is equal to `a` (the loop has finished all iterations).**

In simpler terms: The loop has completed all `a` iterations. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial values. The variables `b` and `c` hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, and `q` is a tuple containing these last values. The loop variable `i` is now equal to `a`, indicating that the loop has finished executing all its iterations.
