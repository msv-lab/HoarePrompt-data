The code snippet `q = b, c` assigns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `c` to the variable `q`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged except for the new variable `q` that is introduced.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is greater than or equal to 1; `b` and `c` are integers provided by the input; `q` is a tuple containing the values of `b` and `c`.**
