Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Nikita can perform two types of operations:
1. Add exactly one cube to the tower.
2. Remove exactly one cube from the tower.

We need to determine if it is possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Observations:
- If `n < m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n`.
- If `n >= m`, it is possible to have `m` cubes if the difference `n - m` is even. This is because:
  - Adding a cube increases the count by 1 (odd to even or even to odd).
  - Removing a cube decreases the count by 1 (even to odd or odd to even).
  
  Therefore, to go from 0 to `m` cubes in `n` moves, the number of additions and subtractions must balance out such that the final count is `m`. This is only possible if `n - m` is even.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program has the following logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
3. It then checks:
   - If `n == m`, it prints "YES".
   - If `n < m`, it prints "NO".
   - If `n % 2 == m % 2`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

Let's check if this logic aligns with our observations:
- If `n == m`, it correctly prints "YES" because no additional operations are needed.
- If `n < m`, it correctly prints "NO" because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
- If `n % 2 == m % 2`, it prints "Yes", which is correct because `n - m` being even means it's possible to end up with `m` cubes.
- The else case correctly handles the scenario where `n % 2 != m % 2`, which means `n - m` is odd, making it impossible to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Correctness: **True**
