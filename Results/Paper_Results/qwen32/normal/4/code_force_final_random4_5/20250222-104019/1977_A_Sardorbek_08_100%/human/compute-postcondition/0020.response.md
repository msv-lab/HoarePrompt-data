The given initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`) and their properties, but it does not provide any specific values for these variables. The code snippet to be executed is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state. The initial state does not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
