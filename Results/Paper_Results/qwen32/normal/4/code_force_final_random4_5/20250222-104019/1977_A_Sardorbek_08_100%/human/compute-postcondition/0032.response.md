The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement: `print('Yes')`. This statement will output the string 'Yes' regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, or `i` as described in the initial state.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions within the code snippet.
2. The string 'Yes' is explicitly given to be printed.
3. The initial state describes various conditions and relationships among variables, but none of these affect the `print` statement directly.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Yes**
