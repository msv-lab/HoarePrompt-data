Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue is that it assumes a greedy approach by sorting the prices and then buying tickets in a way that doesn't account for the increasing prices due to previous purchases. Here is a more detailed explanation:

1. **Sorting and Greedy Approach**: The program sorts the prices and tries to buy tickets from the cheapest available days. However, this greedy approach does not work because buying tickets on a cheaper day increases the prices for all subsequent days, which can make later days more expensive than initially thought.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The cost calculation in the program is incorrect. The program calculates the cost based on a fixed number of tickets bought each day, without considering the increasing prices due to previous purchases.

3. **Handling Remaining Tickets**: The program incorrectly handles the case where the number of tickets to be bought is not a multiple of `m`. It does not correctly calculate the cost for the remaining tickets after buying `m` tickets on each day.

To solve this problem correctly, a dynamic programming approach or a binary search with a greedy check is typically used. The idea is to use binary search to find the minimum cost and then use a greedy approach to check if it's possible to buy `k` tickets for that cost.

Here is a corrected version of the program using a binary search approach:

```python
def can_buy_tickets(prices, m, k, max_cost):
    total_cost = 0
    increase = 0
    for price in prices:
        price += increase
        if price > max_cost:
            break
        tickets_today = min(m, k // price)
        total_cost += tickets_today * price
        k -= tickets_today
        increase += tickets_today
        if k == 0:
            return True
    return k == 0

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        prices.sort()
        
        low, high = 1, 10**18
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if can_buy_tickets(prices, m, k, mid):
                high = mid
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        print(low)

func()
```

This program uses binary search to find the minimum cost and a helper function `can_buy_tickets` to check if it's possible to buy `k` tickets for a given cost. This approach ensures that the increasing prices due to previous purchases are correctly handled.
