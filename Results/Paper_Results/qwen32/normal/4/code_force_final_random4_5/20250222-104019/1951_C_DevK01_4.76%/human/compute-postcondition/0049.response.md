The code snippet `w = N.pop()` removes the last element from the list `N` and assigns it to the variable `w`. This means that the value of `w` is now the last element of the list `N` before it was popped, and the list `N` itself is now one element shorter.

Let's break down the changes:
- `w` is updated to be the last element of the original `N`.
- `N` is updated to be the list `N` with the last element removed.

The other variables like `L`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `M`, `q`, `mu`, and `cost` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`L` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is `t`; `n` is `len(N)`; `m` is `min(m, L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `M` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in ascending order; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is a new list of integers, which is the original `N` with the last element removed; `w` is the last element of the original `N`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` if `n * m` is not equal to `k`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
