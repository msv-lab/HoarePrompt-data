The code snippet `w = N.pop()` removes and returns the last element from the list `N`. Given that `N` is `M[:q]`, the last element of `N` is `M[q-1]`. After popping, `N` will no longer include this element.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is `q`; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` excluding the last element `M[q-1]`; `w` is `M[q-1]`; and `n * m` is not equal to `k`.**
