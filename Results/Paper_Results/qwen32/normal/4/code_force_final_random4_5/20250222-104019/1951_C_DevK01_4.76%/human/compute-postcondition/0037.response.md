To determine the output of the `print(cost)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the calculations involved in determining the value of `cost`.

Given:
- `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `t` is `t - 1` (but `t` is not used in the calculation of `cost`, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `n` is the length of `N`.
- `m` is `min(m, k)`.
- `k` is `L[2]`.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
- `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`.
- `N` is `M[:q]` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed.
- `w` is the last element of the original `N` if `n * m` is not equal to `k`.
- `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` if `n * m` is not equal to `k`.
- `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

Let's break down the calculation of `cost`:

1. **Determine `k`**: `k` is the third element of the list `L` (i.e., `k = L[2]`).
2. **Determine `m`**: `m` is the minimum of its current value and `k` (i.e., `m = min(m, k)`).
3. **Determine `q`**: `q` is the ceiling of `k / m` (i.e., `q = int(math.ceil(k / m))`).
4. **Determine `N`**: 
   - If `n * m == k`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` (i.e., `N = M[:q]`).
   - Otherwise, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` with the last element removed.
5. **Determine `w`**: 
   - If `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
6. **Determine `mu`**: 
   - If `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
7. **Determine `cost`**:
   - If `n * m == k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

Based on the given information, the exact numerical value of `cost` cannot be determined without the specific values of `L`, `M`, `n`, and `m`. However, we can describe the value of `cost` based on the conditions provided.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the given conditions: m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) if n * m == k, otherwise mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu)**
