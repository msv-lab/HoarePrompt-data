The code snippet assigns the values from the list `L` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. Specifically, `n` is assigned the first element of `L`, `m` is assigned the second element of `L`, and `k` is assigned the third element of `L`.

Given the initial state, `n`, `m`, and `k` have specific ranges and constraints, and `L` is a list of integers. After the assignment, `n`, `m`, and `k` will take on the values of `L[0]`, `L[1]`, and `L[2]` respectively.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is `L[1]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
