Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets is flawed. The program attempts to sort the prices and then make decisions based on the sorted list, but it does not properly account for the price increases that occur each day after a purchase.

Here is a specific counterexample:

### Counterexample:
**Input:**
```
1
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
```
**Expected Output:**
```
10
```
**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Buy 0 tickets on the first day. Prices remain [8, 6, 4, 2].
- Buy 0 tickets on the second day. Prices remain [8, 6, 4, 2].
- Buy 1 ticket on the third day at a cost of 4. Prices increase to [9, 7, 5, 3].
- Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day at a cost of 6. Prices increase to [11, 9, 7, 5].

Total cost = 4 + 6 = 10.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program will not produce the expected output because it incorrectly calculates the cost based on a simplified and inaccurate approach. It does not account for the dynamic price increases properly.

### Another Counterexample:
**Input:**
```
1
5 100 1
10000 1 100 10 1000
```
**Expected Output:**
```
1
```
**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Buy 1 ticket on the second day at a cost of 1. Prices increase to [10001, 2, 101, 11, 1001].

Total cost = 1.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program will not produce the expected output because it does not correctly identify the optimal day to buy the single ticket.

The program's logic needs to be revised to correctly account for the dynamic price increases and to find the optimal strategy for purchasing tickets. It should consider the prices and constraints in a way that minimizes the total cost while adhering to the rules of the problem.
