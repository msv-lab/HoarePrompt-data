You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days, given that:
- The price of tickets on day `i` is `a_i`.
- No more than `m` tickets can be bought in a single day.
- Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets on subsequent days by `x`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem in the following way:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the list of prices `a`.
   - It sets `m` to be the minimum of `m` and `k` (this is correct because you cannot buy more tickets than you need or more than the daily limit).
   - It sorts the list of prices `a` in ascending order.
   - It calculates `q`, the minimum number of days needed to buy `k` tickets if you buy `m` tickets per day.
   - It selects the `q` smallest prices from the sorted list.
   - If the total number of tickets bought equals `k` (i.e., `n * m == k`), it calculates the cost based on the formula for an arithmetic series.
   - If not, it adjusts for the remaining tickets and recalculates the cost.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The program uses a formula that does not correctly account for the increasing prices after each purchase.
   - For example, the cost calculation `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` assumes a constant `m` multiplier for the sum, but the prices should be adjusted after each purchase.

2. **Handling Remaining Tickets**:
   - The logic for handling the remaining tickets after buying `m` tickets on `q-1` days is incorrect. The program's approach does not correctly account for the increased prices on subsequent days.

3. **Greedy Approach**:
   - The program attempts to use a greedy approach by always buying tickets on the cheapest available days, but it does not correctly handle the price increase mechanism.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve a dynamic programming or greedy strategy that correctly accounts for the price increase after each purchase. The program should:
- Always buy tickets on the cheapest available day.
- Adjust the prices for subsequent days after each purchase.
- Continue this process until `k` tickets are bought.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the cost calculation and handling of the price increase mechanism, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
