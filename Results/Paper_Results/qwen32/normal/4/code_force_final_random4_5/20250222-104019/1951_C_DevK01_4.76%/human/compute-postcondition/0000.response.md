The value of `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer; `n` is either 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `m` is either 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `k` is either 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
