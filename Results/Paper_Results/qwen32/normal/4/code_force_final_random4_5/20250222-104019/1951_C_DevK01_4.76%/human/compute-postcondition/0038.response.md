Output State: **`L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the length of `N`; `m` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed; `w` is the last element of the original `N` if `n * m` is not equal to `k`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` if `n * m` is not equal to `k`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables or the state of the program. It simply passes control to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, all variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
