In the provided for loop, the loop head only contains the variable `_` and the range `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1 because the loop will iterate `t` times. The other variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. 

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` do not affect the execution of the loop itself.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is either 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `m` is either 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `k` is either 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**
