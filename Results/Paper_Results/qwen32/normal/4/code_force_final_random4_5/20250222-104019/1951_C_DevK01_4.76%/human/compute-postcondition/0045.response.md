The code snippet provided recalculates the value of `q` using the formula `q = int(math.ceil(k / m))`. This means `q` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to the division of `k` by `m`.

Given the initial state, the only change is the updated value of `q` based on the formula provided. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`L` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is `t`; `n` is `L[0]`; `m` is `min(m, L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `M` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in ascending order; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed; `w` is the last element of the original `N` if `n * m` is not equal to `k`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` if `n * m` is not equal to `k`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
