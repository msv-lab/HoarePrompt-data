The given code modifies the `cost` variable by adding a computed value to it. Let's break down the new value being added to `cost`:

1. `m * sum(N)`: This is `m` multiplied by the sum of the elements in `N`.
2. `m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)`: This is `m` squared multiplied by the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n-1` items, which is a combinatorial formula for combinations.
3. `n * m * mu`: This is `n` multiplied by `m` and then by `mu`.

The new value added to `cost` is the sum of these three expressions. Therefore, the new value of `cost` is the old `cost` plus this sum.

Given that `cost` was initially `mu * w`, the new `cost` will be:

\[ \text{cost} = \text{mu} * w + m * \text{sum}(N) + m * m * \left(\frac{(n - 1) * (n - 2)}{2}\right) + n * m * \text{mu} \]

Now, let's format this as the output state:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is `len(N)`; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` excluding the last element `M[q-1]`; `w` is `M[q-1]`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `n * m` is not equal to `k`; `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
