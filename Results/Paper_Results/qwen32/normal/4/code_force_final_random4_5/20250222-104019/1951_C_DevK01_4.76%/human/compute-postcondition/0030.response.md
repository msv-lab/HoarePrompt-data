The provided code snippet updates the `cost` variable based on the given formula. The formula `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is used to calculate the new value of `cost`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this calculation.

Let's break down the impact of the code:
- `cost` is updated to `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- All other variables (`L`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `M`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`) remain unchanged as they are not directly modified in this code snippet.

Output State: **`L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the length of `N`; `m` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**.
