### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of days tickets are on sale.
     - `m`: Maximum number of tickets that can be bought on a single day.
     - `k`: Total number of tickets to be bought.
     - `a`: List of prices for tickets on each day.

2. **Constraints:**
   - `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5`
   - `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9`
   - `1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)`
   - `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`
   - Sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 · 10^5`.

3. **Goal:**
   - Find the minimum cost to buy exactly `k` tickets under the given constraints.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a`.

2. **Adjustments:**
   - `m = min(m, k)`: Ensures that `m` does not exceed the number of tickets `k` we need to buy.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The list `a` is sorted to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first.

4. **Calculation of `q`:**
   - `q = int(math.ceil(k / m))`: Calculates the minimum number of days required to buy `k` tickets.

5. **Selection of Days:**
   - `N = M[:q]`: Selects the first `q` days with the lowest prices.

6. **Cost Calculation:**
   - **If `n * m == k`:**
     - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`: This formula seems to be incorrect as it does not account for the increasing prices correctly.
   - **Else:**
     - `w = N.pop()`: Pops the last (highest) price from `N`.
     - `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`: Calculates the remaining tickets to buy after buying `m` tickets on `n-1` days.
     - `cost = mu * w`: Cost for the remaining tickets.
     - `cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`: This formula also seems to be incorrect as it does not account for the increasing prices correctly.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation:** Both cost calculation formulas do not correctly account for the increasing prices due to the tickets bought previously. The price increase should be applied to all subsequent days, not just the days within `N`.
- **Inefficient Selection:** The program selects the first `q` days with the lowest prices but does not account for the increasing prices when calculating the total cost.

#### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets under the given constraints. The cost calculation formulas are incorrect, and they do not account for the increasing prices due to the tickets bought previously.

### Correctness: **False**
