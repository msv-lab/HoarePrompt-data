The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the integer value provided by the input. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the four integers read from the input; `i` is 1.**
