The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the integer read from the input. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the four integers read from the input; `i` is 2.**
