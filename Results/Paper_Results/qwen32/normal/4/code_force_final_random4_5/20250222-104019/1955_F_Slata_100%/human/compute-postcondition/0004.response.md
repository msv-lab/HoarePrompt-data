The code snippet reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The variable `i` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are updated to the integers read from the input, and `i` remains 1.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the four integers read from the input; `i` is 1.**
