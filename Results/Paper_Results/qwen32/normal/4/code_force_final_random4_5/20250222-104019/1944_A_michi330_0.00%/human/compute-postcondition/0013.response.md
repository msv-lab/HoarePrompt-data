The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be 2 (since it is incremented by 1 from the previous value of 1).
- `t` remains unchanged as it is the total number of test cases and does not change during the loop iterations.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `n` and `k` are the two integers from the new input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.**
