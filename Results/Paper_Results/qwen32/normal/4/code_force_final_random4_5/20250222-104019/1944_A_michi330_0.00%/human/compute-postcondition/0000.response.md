Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. The function receives multiple test cases. Each test case is a tuple of two integers (n, k) where n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) represents the number of islands and k (0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2) represents the maximum number of bridges Dominater can destroy.**

In simpler terms, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the number of test cases, which is an integer input by the user. All other conditions and variables mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged.
