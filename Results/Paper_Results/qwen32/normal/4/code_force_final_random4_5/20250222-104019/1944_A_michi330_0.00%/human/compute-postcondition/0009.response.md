The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 1, and the conditions for `n` and `k` are given. However, the code snippet does not modify `t` or `i`, and it updates `n` and `k` with new values from the input.

Since the code snippet only updates `n` and `k` with new values from the input, the output state will reflect these new values for `n` and `k`, while `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `n` and `k` are the two integers from the new input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.**
