Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case is a tuple of two integers (n, k). Here, n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) represents the number of islands, and k (0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2) represents the maximum number of bridges Dominater can destroy. The function returns the result based on these inputs, which is not specified in the provided information.**
