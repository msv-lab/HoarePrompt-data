The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the previous values of `n` and `k` are replaced by the new input values. The other variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `n` and `k` are the new input integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.**
