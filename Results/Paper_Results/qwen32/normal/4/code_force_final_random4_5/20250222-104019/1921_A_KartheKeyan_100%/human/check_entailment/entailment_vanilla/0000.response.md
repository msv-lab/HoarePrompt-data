Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
- We are given the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
- We need to calculate the area of the square.
- The area of a square is calculated as the side length squared.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square.

2. **Sorting the Coordinates**:
   - The coordinates are sorted. However, sorting the coordinates in this manner does not directly help in determining the side length of the square. Sorting based on the x or y values alone does not necessarily place the coordinates in a way that allows easy calculation of the side length.

3. **Calculating Side Length**:
   - The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of coordinates (`p1` and `p2`), which are assumed to be adjacent sides of the square.
   - It then calculates the side length by taking the square root of the product of these distances (`res = math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`).
   - The result is rounded and printed.

### Issues in the Program:
- The method of selecting the pairs of coordinates to calculate the side lengths is incorrect. Simply taking the first two and the last two sorted coordinates does not guarantee that they are adjacent sides of the square.
- The calculation of the side length is flawed. The area of the square should be calculated as the square of the length of one side, not the product of the lengths of two sides.
- The rounding of the result before printing may not be necessary and could lead to incorrect results due to floating-point precision issues.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach would be to find the unique x and y coordinates, which will give us the side length of the square.
- The side length can be calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum x (or y) coordinates.
- The area is then the square of this side length.

### Example Fix:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        x_coords = [point[0] for point in coord]
        y_coords = [point[1] for point in coord]
        side_length = max(x_coords) - min(x_coords)
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)
        n -= 1

func()
```

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the provided program, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
