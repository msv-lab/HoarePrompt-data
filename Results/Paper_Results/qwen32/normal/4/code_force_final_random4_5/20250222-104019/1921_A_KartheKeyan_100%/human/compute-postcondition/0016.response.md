The code calculates the squared Euclidean distance between the first two points in the sorted `coord` list and assigns this value to `p1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the fourth integer from the input, `y` is the fourth integer from the input, `n` is a non-zero integer, `coord` is a sorted list of `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]` based on the default tuple sorting, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`.**
