Based on the provided loop and the initial state, the loop runs for a fixed number of iterations (4 times). The loop collects coordinate pairs from the input and appends them to the `coord` list. Here's how the state evolves through each iteration:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `x` is the fourth integer from the input.
   - `y` is the fourth integer from the input.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `coord` is `[]`.
   - `res` is `0`.
   - `i` is `3`.
   - `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])` (undefined initially, as `coord` is empty).
   - `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])` (undefined initially, as `coord` is empty).

2. **After 1st Iteration**:
   - `coord` becomes `[(x, y)]` (where `x` and `y` are the new input values).

3. **After 2nd Iteration**:
   - `coord` becomes `[(x, y), (x, y)]` (where `x` and `y` are the new input values).

4. **After 3rd Iteration**:
   - `coord` becomes `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]` (where `x` and `y` are the new input values).

5. **After 4th Iteration**:
   - `coord` becomes `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]` (where `x` and `y` are the new input values).

Since the loop runs exactly 4 times, the final state of the variables will be:

- `x` and `y` will be the values of the last pair of integers read from the input.
- `i` will be `3` (the loop variable `i` will be the last value it takes in the range, which is `3`).
- `coord` will contain 4 tuples, each representing a coordinate pair read from the input.
- `res` and `n` remain unchanged as per the given information.

Thus, the final output state after all the loop iterations:

Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `coord` will have four coordinate pairs, with `x` and `y` being the last pair read, and `i` will be `3`. All other variables remain as initially defined or calculated within the loop.
