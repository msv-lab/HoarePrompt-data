The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Since `coord` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `coord` will contain one tuple. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and `n`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2` are not affected by this operation because they do not depend on the length or contents of `coord` at the time of their initialization.

Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the current input, `y` is the second integer from the current input, `n` must be at least 2, `coord` is `[(x, y)]`, `res` is `0`, `i` is `3`, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

Note: Since `coord` now only contains one element, `p1` and `p2` cannot be computed as they depend on at least four elements in `coord`. However, they are left as expressions since the initial state specifies their definitions.
