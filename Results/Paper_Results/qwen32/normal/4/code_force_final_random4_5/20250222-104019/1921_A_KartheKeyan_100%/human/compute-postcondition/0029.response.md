The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the `coord` list. This means that `coord` will now have an additional element at the end, making its length 6 instead of 5. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is `[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**.
