Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `n` must be at least 2, `coord` is `[]`, `res` is `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

In this output state, the variable `coord` has been reset to an empty list. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
