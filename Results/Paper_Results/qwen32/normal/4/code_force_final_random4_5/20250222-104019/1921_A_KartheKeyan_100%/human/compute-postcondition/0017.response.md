The provided Python code snippet calculates the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth points in the `coord` list and assigns it to the variable `p2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Here is the updated state of the variables after the code execution:
- `x` and `y` are still the fourth integer from the input.
- `n` remains a non-zero integer.
- `coord` remains a sorted list of `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`.
- `res` remains 0.
- `i` remains 3.
- `p1` remains `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`.
- `p2` is now `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`.

Output State: **`x` is the fourth integer from the input, `y` is the fourth integer from the input, `n` is a non-zero integer, `coord` is a sorted list of `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`.**
