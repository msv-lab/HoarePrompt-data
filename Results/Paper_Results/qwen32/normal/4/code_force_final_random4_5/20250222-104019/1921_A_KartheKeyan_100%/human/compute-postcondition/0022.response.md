The code snippet `coord = []` resets the `coord` variable to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the fourth integer from the input, `y` is the fourth integer from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is [], `res` is `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**. 

In simpler terms, `coord` is now an empty list, while all other variables retain their previous values.
