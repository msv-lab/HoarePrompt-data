The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This means that the values of `x` and `y` will be updated to whatever integers are provided in the input.

Given the initial state, the variables `x` and `y` were already defined, but their values were not specified. After executing the code, the values of `x` and `y` will be the integers read from the input, while all other variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is `[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**
