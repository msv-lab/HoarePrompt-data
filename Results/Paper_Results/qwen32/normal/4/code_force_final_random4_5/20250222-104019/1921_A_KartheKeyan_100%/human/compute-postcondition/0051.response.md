The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the `coord` list. Initially, `coord` contains two tuples `[(x, y), (x, y)]`. After appending, `coord` will contain three tuples `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]`.

The values of `x` and `y` remain the same, and `n` must still be at least 2. The variables `res`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, `n` must be at least 2, `coord` is `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is `0`, `i` is `4`, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**
