Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `n` is at least 1, `coord` is the sorted list of `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`, `res` is `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`, `i` is `3`, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

Explanation: The value of `n` is decremented by 1, so if `n` was initially at least 2, it is now at least 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
