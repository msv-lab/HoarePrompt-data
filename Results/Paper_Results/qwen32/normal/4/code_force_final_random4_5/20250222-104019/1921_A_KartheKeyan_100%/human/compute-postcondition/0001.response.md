The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code reads an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. Given the initial state, `n` was initially 0. After executing this line, `n` will hold the value of the integer input provided by the user.

The coordinates of the corners of the square remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area; `n` is an input integer.**
