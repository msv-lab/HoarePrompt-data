Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game strategy for both Alice and Bob. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should aim to maximize the sum of the array after removing at most `k` elements. The current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly determine which elements Alice should remove to achieve this. It simply removes the largest elements, which might not always be optimal.

2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob should aim to minimize the sum of the array after multiplying at most `x` elements by `-1`. The current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly determine which elements Bob should multiply by `-1` to achieve this. It considers a fixed number of elements to flip, but it does not dynamically choose the smallest (most negative impact when flipped) elements.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where all elements are positive or all are negative, or where `k` or `x` are equal to `n`.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

**Example:**
```
1
5 2 2
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5
```
**Expected Output:**
```
-3
```
**Explanation:**
- Alice should remove the two largest elements, which are `-1` and `-2`. The array becomes `[-3, -4, -5]`.
- Bob should then flip the two smallest elements, which are `-5` and `-4`, to `5` and `4`. The array becomes `[-3, 4, 5]`.
- The final sum is `-3 + 4 + 5 = 6`.

However, the current implementation might not correctly handle this scenario, leading to an incorrect result.

**Another Example:**
```
1
5 3 1
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5
```
**Expected Output:**
```
-14
```
**Explanation:**
- Alice should remove the three largest elements, which are `-1`, `-2`, and `-3`. The array becomes `[-4, -5]`.
- Bob should then flip the smallest element, which is `-5`, to `5`. The array becomes `[-4, 5]`.
- The final sum is `-4 + 5 = 1`.

However, the current implementation might not correctly handle this scenario, leading to an incorrect result.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob, and thus the correctness is **False**.
