The code calculates the sum of the `elements` list and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, and `pos` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`). `elements` is a list of integers. `pos` is an empty list. `s` is the sum of `elements`.**
