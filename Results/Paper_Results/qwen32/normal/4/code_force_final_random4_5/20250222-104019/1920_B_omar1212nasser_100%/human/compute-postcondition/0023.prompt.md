Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`). `elements` is a list of integers. `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`. `s` is the sum of `elements`. `s2` is the sum of `elements[-negatives:]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, removals + 1):
    s -= elements[-i]
    s2 -= elements[-i]
    if negatives + i <= len(elements):
        s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
    pos.append(s - 2 * s2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s` is the sum of `elements` minus `elements[-i]` and `s2` is `s2 - elements[-i] + elements[-(negatives + i)]`. Otherwise, `s` and `s2` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is updated to `s - elements[-i]`, and `s2` is updated to `s2 - elements[-i] + elements[-(negatives + i)]`. If `negatives + i` is greater than the length of `elements`, no changes are made to `i`, `s`, or `s2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `s` is reduced by `elements[-i]`. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is increased by `elements[-(negatives + i)]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
