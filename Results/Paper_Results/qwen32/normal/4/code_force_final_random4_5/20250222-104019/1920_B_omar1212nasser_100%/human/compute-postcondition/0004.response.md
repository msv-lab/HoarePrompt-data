To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(1, removals + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `removals`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the range `(1, removals + 1)` must contain at least one integer. This means `removals + 1` must be greater than 1, implying `removals` must be at least 1. Therefore, `removals` should be adjusted to be at least 1.

The variables `negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, `s`, and `s2` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the constraints and the requirement to only adjust the state of objects in the loop head, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, `s` is the sum of `elements`, `s2` is the sum of `elements[-negatives:]`**
