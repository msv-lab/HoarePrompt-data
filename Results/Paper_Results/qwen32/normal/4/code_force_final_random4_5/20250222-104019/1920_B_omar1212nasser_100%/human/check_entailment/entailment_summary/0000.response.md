### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and their behavior to see if they meet the problem description and constraints.

**Function `func_1`**:
- This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the list `a` of `n` integers.
- It sorts the list `a` in ascending order.
- It calls `func_2` with the parameters `k` (removals), `x` (negatives), and the sorted list `a`.
- It prints the result returned by `func_2`.

**Function `func_2`**:
- This function calculates the maximum possible sum after Alice removes up to `removals` elements and Bob inverts the sign of up to `negatives` elements.
- It initializes a list `pos` to store possible sums.
- It first calculates the sum of all elements `s` and the sum of the last `negatives` elements `s2`.
- It computes the sum `s - 2 * s2` and appends it to `pos`. This represents the scenario where no elements are removed by Alice but up to `negatives` elements are inverted by Bob.
- It iterates over the range from 1 to `removals` (inclusive), updating `s` and `s2` as Alice removes elements:
  - `s` is updated by subtracting the last `i` elements of the sorted list.
  - `s2` is updated by subtracting the last `i` elements of the sorted list and adding the next element (if available) after the last `negatives + i` elements.
  - It computes the sum `s - 2 * s2` and appends it to `pos`.
- Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

### Analysis:
- **Sorting**: Sorting the list `a` in ascending order is a good strategy because it allows Alice to remove the smallest elements first (maximizing the sum) and Bob to invert the sign of the smallest remaining elements (minimizing the sum).
- **Computation**: The function `func_2` iteratively computes the sum of the array after different combinations of removals by Alice and negations by Bob. By considering all possible numbers of removals (from 0 to `removals`), it ensures that the optimal combination is found.
- **Correctness**: The logic in `func_2` covers all possible scenarios where Alice can remove up to `k` elements and Bob can invert the sign of up to `x` elements. The final result is the maximum sum achievable given these constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions together correctly implement the problem's requirements and constraints. They ensure that both players play optimally to achieve the desired outcome.

**Correctness: True**
