The code snippet appends a calculated value to the list `pos`. The value being appended is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, where `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements`, and `sum(elements[-negatives:])` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.

Given this, the new value added to `pos` is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`. This does not change the values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, or `s`. Only `pos` is updated by having a new element appended to it.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`). `elements` is a list of integers. `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`. `s` is the sum of `elements`.**
