Let's carefully analyze the program and the original assessment to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis Recap

Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\). He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then form a new rectangle using the two smaller rectangles. The new rectangle must be different from the original one, considering that rotations of the same rectangle are considered identical.

### Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle

1. **If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd:**
   - Cutting the rectangle will result in two rectangles of different sizes, but when combined, they can only form a rectangle of the same dimensions as the original. Thus, it's impossible to form a different rectangle.
   
2. **If one of \(a\) or \(b\) is even:**
   - Bob can always form a new rectangle by combining the two smaller rectangles in a different configuration.
   
3. **If \(a = 2b\) or \(b = 2a\):**
   - The two smaller rectangles formed will be of size \(a \times b/2\) or \(a/2 \times b\), which can only form a rectangle of the same dimensions as the original. Thus, it's impossible to form a different rectangle.
   
4. **In all other cases:**
   - Bob can form a new rectangle by arranging the smaller rectangles in a different configuration.

### Program Analysis

The given program is:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

#### Condition Analysis

- **Condition 1:** `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:`
  - This correctly identifies the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, and in this case, Bob cannot form a different rectangle. This is correct.
  
- **Condition 2:** `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:`
  - This correctly identifies the cases where one dimension is exactly twice the other, and in these cases, Bob cannot form a different rectangle. This is correct.
  
- **Else Case:** `else: print('YES')`
  - For all other cases, the program outputs "YES", which is correct because Bob can always form a different rectangle by arranging the smaller rectangles in a different configuration.

### Annotated Code Analysis

The annotations describe the program's state at key points:

1. **State before the function call:**
   - \(t\) is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case, \(a\) and \(b\) are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).

2. **Inside the function:**
   - The loop executes \(n\) times.
   - For each iteration, it reads a pair of integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it prints 'NO'.
   - If one of \(a\) or \(b\) is twice the other, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Conclusion

The annotated code and the original assessment correctly capture the logic needed to solve the problem. The program correctly identifies the conditions under which Bob can and cannot form a different rectangle.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
