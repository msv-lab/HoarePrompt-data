You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `n` times, and for each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `a` and `b`. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'NO'. If one of `a` or `b` is twice the other, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The values of `t`, `n`, and the relationship between `a` and `b` for each iteration are as specified in the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It prints 'NO' if both `a` and `b` are odd or if one is exactly twice the other. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. Let's analyze the logic in the code:

1. The program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If they are, it prints "NO", which is correct because an odd by odd rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
2. The program then checks if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`. If either condition is true, it prints "NO". This is incorrect because these conditions do not cover all cases where a new rectangle cannot be formed. For example, a 4x3 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles and rearranged to form a 3x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 4x3 rectangle.
3. If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "YES", which is not always correct.

Let's consider a counterexample:
- For a rectangle of size 4x3, the program will print "YES" because neither `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` nor `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` is true. However, this is incorrect because the 4x3 rectangle can indeed be cut into two 2x3 rectangles and rearranged to form a 3x4 rectangle, which is a different rectangle.

Another counterexample:
- For a rectangle of size 6x2, the program will print "YES" because neither `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` nor `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` is true. However, this is incorrect because the 6x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x2 rectangles and rearranged to form a 2x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original 6x2 rectangle when considering rotations.

The correct logic should be:
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, print "NO".
- Otherwise, print "YES" because the rectangle can always be cut and rearranged to form a different rectangle.

The correct implementation would be:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

This implementation correctly handles all cases according to the problem description.
