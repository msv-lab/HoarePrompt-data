Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0. If both `a` and `b` are odd integers, then no further changes are made to `a` or `b`. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even, and if `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, then either `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`. Otherwise, neither `a` is half of `b` nor `b` is half of `a`.**
