Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate or not.

### Problem Analysis
Bob needs to cut a rectangle of size `a x b` into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle. The key points are:
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, it's impossible to form a new rectangle because the resulting smaller rectangles would also have odd dimensions, and they cannot be rearranged to form a rectangle with integer sides.
- If one dimension is exactly twice the other, the resulting rectangles will still form the same rectangle when rearranged (considering rotations).
- In all other cases, it is possible to form a new rectangle by cutting and rearranging.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.
3. It checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If so, it prints "NO".
4. It checks if one dimension is exactly twice the other. If so, it prints "NO".
5. Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Function Summary
The function summary correctly describes the logic of the program:
- It prints 'NO' if both `a` and `b` are odd.
- It prints 'NO' if one dimension is exactly twice the other.
- Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect due to the following reasons:
1. It correctly identifies that if both `a` and `b` are odd, a new rectangle cannot be formed.
2. It incorrectly states that checking if one dimension is exactly twice the other is incorrect, providing counterexamples like `4x3` and `6x2`.

### Detailed Reasoning
Let's re-evaluate the logic:
- For a `4x3` rectangle, the program prints "YES" because neither `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` nor `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` is true. However, this is correct because the 4x3 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles and rearranged to form a 3x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 4x3 rectangle.
- For a `6x2` rectangle, the program prints "YES" because `a / 2 == b` is true, so it prints "NO". This is correct because the 6x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x2 rectangles and rearranged to form a 2x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original 6x2 rectangle when considering rotations.

The original assessment incorrectly states that the program is wrong for `4x3` and `6x2` because it misunderstands the condition `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a`. This condition is actually correct for preventing the formation of a new rectangle in cases where one dimension is exactly twice the other.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is incorrect. The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the function summary.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
