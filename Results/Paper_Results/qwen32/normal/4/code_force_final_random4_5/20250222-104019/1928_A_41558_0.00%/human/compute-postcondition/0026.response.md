Output State: **The loop has executed `n` times, and for each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `a` and `b`. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'NO'. If one of `a` or `b` is twice the other, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The values of `t`, `n`, and the relationship between `a` and `b` for each iteration are as specified in the input.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The loop has run exactly `n` times.
- For each of these `n` iterations, a pair of integers `a` and `b` has been read from the input.
- If both `a` and `b` were odd, the loop printed 'NO'.
- If one of the numbers was exactly twice the other, the loop printed 'NO'.
- Otherwise, the loop printed 'YES'.
- The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged throughout the execution.
- The specific values of `a` and `b` for each iteration are determined by the input and do not affect the overall state beyond the loop's output for each iteration.
