You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2

    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:

The values of `t`, `n`, and the relationship between `a` and `b` for each iteration are as specified in the input.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the correctness of the given program step-by-step based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\). He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the original rectangle's sides. Then, he wants to form a new rectangle using the two smaller rectangles. The new rectangle must be different from the original one, considering that rotations of the same rectangle are considered identical.

### Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle parallel to its length, he gets two rectangles of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) (if \(b\) is even) or \(a \times \left(\frac{b-1}{2}\right)\) and \(a \times \left(\frac{b+1}{2}\right)\) (if \(b\) is odd).
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle parallel to its width, he gets two rectangles of size \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) (if \(a\) is even) or \(\left(\frac{a-1}{2}\right) \times b\) and \(\left(\frac{a+1}{2}\right) \times b\) (if \(a\) is odd).

2. **Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, cutting will result in two rectangles of different sizes, but when combined, they can only form a rectangle of the same dimensions as the original. Thus, it's impossible to form a different rectangle.
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) (but not both) is even, Bob can always form a new rectangle by combining the two smaller rectangles in a different configuration.
   - If \(a = 2b\) or \(b = 2a\), the two smaller rectangles formed will be of size \(a \times b/2\) or \(a/2 \times b\), which can only form a rectangle of the same dimensions as the original. Thus, it's impossible to form a different rectangle.
   - In all other cases, Bob can form a new rectangle by arranging the smaller rectangles in a different configuration.

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the given program to see if it correctly implements the above logic.

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

- **Condition 1:** `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:` This correctly identifies the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, and in this case, Bob cannot form a different rectangle.
- **Condition 2:** `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` This correctly identifies the cases where one dimension is exactly twice the other, and in these cases, Bob cannot form a different rectangle.
- **Else Case:** For all other cases, the program outputs "YES", which is correct because Bob can always form a different rectangle.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
