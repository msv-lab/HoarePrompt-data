n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and b is a list of n integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
