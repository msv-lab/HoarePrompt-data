The code snippet creates a new list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of the corresponding elements `a[i]` and `b[i]` from the lists `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9
- `b` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9

After executing the code, the new list `c` is created, and the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `b` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` is the minimum of `a_i` and `b_i`.**
