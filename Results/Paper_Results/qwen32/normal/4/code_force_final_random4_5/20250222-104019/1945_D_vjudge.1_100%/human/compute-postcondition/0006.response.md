The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so we need to adjust `i` to the next value that allows the loop to execute again.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, to get to the start of the next iteration, `i` should be decremented by 1 from its current value.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so `i` must have been `i - 1` at the start of that iteration. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i - 1`.

Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` as the value it had at the start of the previous iteration.

So, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was incremented to its current value, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one less than its current value.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `b` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` is the minimum of `a_i` and `b_i`; `suff` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `suff[i]` is now `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`; `i` is decremented by 1.**
