You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and b is a list of n integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `b` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` is the minimum of `a_i` and `b_i`; `suff` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[j]` for all `j` from `i` to `n-1`.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `b` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` is the minimum of `a_i` and `b_i`; `suff` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[j]` for all `j` from `i` to `n-1`; `ans` is `min(float('inf'), a[0] + suff[1], a[1] + suff[2], ..., a[k-1] + suff[k]); `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is k-1.`
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value of the sums a[0] + suff[1], a[1] + suff[2], ..., a[k-1] + suff[k])
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of elements in lists `a` and `b`), `k` (an integer such that 1 <= k <= n), and two lists `a` and `b` (each containing `n` integers where each integer in `a` and `b` is between 1 and 10^9). The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
