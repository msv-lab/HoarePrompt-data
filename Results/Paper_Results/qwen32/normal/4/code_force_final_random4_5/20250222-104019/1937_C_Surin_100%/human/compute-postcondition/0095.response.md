The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer to ensure that all output is written to the standard output. This operation does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1` if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'`, `v2` is 1, `i` is 1, `r` is the user's input.**
