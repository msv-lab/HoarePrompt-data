The code snippet provided is `prev = i`. However, the variable `i` is not defined within the provided context. Given the initial state and the code, it seems there might be some missing information or context about where `i` is coming from. Assuming `i` is the variable that was used in the previous conditions (like in a loop or a conditional block), and considering the context of the problem, `i` should be equal to `v1` because `v1` is described as the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`.

Given this assumption, the variable `prev` will be updated to the value of `v1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `prev` is `v1`, `r` is the user's input, and `r` is `'>'`**.
