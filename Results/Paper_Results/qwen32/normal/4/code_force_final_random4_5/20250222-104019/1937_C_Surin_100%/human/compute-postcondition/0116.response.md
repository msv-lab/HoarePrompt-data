Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is set to `v1`. If `r` is `'='`, `r2` is the user's input to the new `input('')` prompt, and `prev` is set to `v1` if `r2` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0. `kp` is unchanged.**
