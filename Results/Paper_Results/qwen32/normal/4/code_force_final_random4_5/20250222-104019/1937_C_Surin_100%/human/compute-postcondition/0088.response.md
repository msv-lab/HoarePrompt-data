The provided code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer. This action does not change the values of any variables or the state of the program in terms of data storage. Therefore, the variables `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`**.
