The code snippet `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `prev`. No other variables are affected by this statement. Given the initial state:

- `n` must be greater than `v1 + 1`
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`
- `kp` is unchanged
- `i` is `v1 + 1`
- `r` is the user's input
- `r2` is the user's input

After executing `prev = i`, the value of `prev` will be `v1 + 1`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `v1 + 1`, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `kp` is unchanged, `i` is `v1 + 1`, `r` is the user's input, `r2` is the user's input, `prev` is `v1 + 1`**.
