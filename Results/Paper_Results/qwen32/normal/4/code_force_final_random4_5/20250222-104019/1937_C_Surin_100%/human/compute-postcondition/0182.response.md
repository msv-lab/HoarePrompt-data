The code snippet `r2 = input('')` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `r2`, which is now assigned the value of the user's input.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such input was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `r` is `'='`, `r2` is the user's input.**
