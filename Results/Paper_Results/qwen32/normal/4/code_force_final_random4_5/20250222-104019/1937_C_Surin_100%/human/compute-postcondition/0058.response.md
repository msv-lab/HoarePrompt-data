The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop variable `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `v1 + 1`, which is the value it took after the last increment.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again from its current value (`v1 + 1`).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `v1 + 2`.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `r` is the user's input, `prev` is `v1 + 1`, `i` is `v1 + 2`**
