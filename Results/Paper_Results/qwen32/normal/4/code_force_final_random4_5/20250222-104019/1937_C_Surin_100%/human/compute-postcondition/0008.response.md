Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1 (though `n` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the precondition).
- `g` is 0 (though `g` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the precondition).
- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is equal to `i`. However, `i` is not defined in the initial state. We will assume `i` is a variable that has some value, but since it's not specified, we can only use the information given.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
- `v1` is explicitly given as 0.
- `v2` is equal to `i`, but the value of `i` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `v2`.

### Output:
Given the information, we can determine that `v1` is 0, and `v2` is `i`. Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe `v2` in terms of `i`.

Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is the value of the variable i)**
