Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `prev` is 0, `kp` is unchanged, `r` is `'='`, `r2` is the user's input to the new `input('')` prompt.**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains greater than 1, `g` remains 0, `v1` remains the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `prev` remains 0, `kp` remains unchanged, `r` remains `'='`, and `r2` is now the user's input to the new `input('')` prompt.
