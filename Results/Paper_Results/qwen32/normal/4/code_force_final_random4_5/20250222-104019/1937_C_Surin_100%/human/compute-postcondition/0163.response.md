The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the value it had at the end of the last iteration plus 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `n`.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`. Since `i_prev + 1` is the value `i` had at the end of the last iteration, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `i_prev + 2`.

Given that `v2` is equal to `i` and `v1` is equal to `v2` if `r` is `<`, otherwise `v1` remains unchanged, these conditions do not affect the loop head variables `i` and `n` directly. They are part of the loop body and do not influence the continuation condition of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is the value it had at the end of the last iteration plus 2**.
