Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'`, `v2` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'`. If the user's input response `r` is `'<'`, then `v1` is updated to `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` remains unchanged.**
