Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `n > i` - This indicates that `n` is greater than `i`.
2. `g = 0` - This sets `g` to 0.
3. `v1 = i - 1` - This sets `v1` to the value of `i` minus 1.
4. `r` is the user input string - This indicates that `r` is a string provided by the user.
5. `i = i + 1` - This increments the value of `i` by 1.
6. `v2 = i` - This sets `v2` to the new value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. Initially, `v1` is set to `i - 1`.
2. Then, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
3. `v2` is then set to the new value of `i`, which is `i + 1`.

Thus, the values to be printed are:
- `v1` is `i - 1`.
- `v2` is `i + 1`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the formatted string with the values of `v1` and `v2` as described.

Output: **? [i - 1] [i - 1] [i + 1] [i + 1] (where i is the initial value of i before incrementing)**
