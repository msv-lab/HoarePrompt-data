Let's analyze the given initial state and code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `n` is at least 2.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is `n-1` if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'`.
- `v2` is 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `r` is the user's input.

### Key Points:
- The value of `v1` depends on the user's input `r`.
- If `r` is `'<'`, `v1` is `n-1`.
- If `r` is not `'<'`, `v1` is the largest integer `i` from 1 to `n-1` for which the user's response was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'`. However, since we don't have the user's responses history, we can only consider the first condition where `r` is `'<'` for a precise answer.
- `v2` is always 1.

### Code Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Determining the Output:
- If `r` is `'<'`, then `v1` will be `n-1`.
- `v2` is always 1.

So, the print statement will output:
- `?` followed by `v1` (which is `n-1`), `v1` again (which is `n-1`), `v2` (which is 1), and `v2` again (which is 1).

### Final Output:
Output: **? [n-1] [n-1] 1 1 (where n is at least 2)**
