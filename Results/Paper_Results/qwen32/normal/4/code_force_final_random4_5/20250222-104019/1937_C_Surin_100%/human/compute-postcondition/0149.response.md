The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. The values of `n`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`, and `kp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `prev` is the largest `i` for which the user input was `'>'` or `'='` and the subsequent comparison with `prev` resulted in `'<'`, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `v2` is `i`.**
