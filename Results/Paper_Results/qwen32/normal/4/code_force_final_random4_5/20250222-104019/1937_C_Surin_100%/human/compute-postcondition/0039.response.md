The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call does not alter the values of any variables; it simply flushes the output buffer to ensure that all output is written to the standard output device. Therefore, none of the variables (`n`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`, `r`) are changed by this code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `prev` is 0, `r` is `'='`.**
