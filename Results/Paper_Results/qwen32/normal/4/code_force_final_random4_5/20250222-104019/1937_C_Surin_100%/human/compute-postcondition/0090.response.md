The value of `v1` is updated to be equal to `v2`. Since `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` now also holds the value `n-1`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `g`, `v2`, `i`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `r` is the user's input.**
