Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`. If `r2` is `'<'`, then `prev` is set to `v1 + 2` and `i` is set to `v1 + 2`. If `r2` is not `'<'`, then `prev` and `i` remain unchanged. `r` is the user's initial input, and `r2` is the user's new input.**
