The code snippet provided is `y = a + b`. Given the initial state, `y` was already defined as `a + b`. The execution of this line does not change the value of `y` since it is being reassigned to the same expression it was originally defined with.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to the variables provided.

Output State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 30, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, `c` is the third integer from the new input, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`; `y` is `a + b`.**
