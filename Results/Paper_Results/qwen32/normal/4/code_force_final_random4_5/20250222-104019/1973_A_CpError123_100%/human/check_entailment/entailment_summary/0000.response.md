### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify that it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of draws based on the given constraints.

1. **Sum of Scores Check**:
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. This is a necessary condition because each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2-0 or 1-1 in case of a draw). If the total points are odd, it's impossible to distribute them in such a way, so the program correctly outputs `-1`.

2. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates `x = (a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of games played, since each game contributes 2 points.
   - It then calculates `y = a + b`, which represents the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest and middle scores.
   - The program outputs the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is because:
     - `x` is the total number of games, and each game can contribute at most one draw.
     - `y` is the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest and middle scores. If the sum of their scores is less than the total number of games, it means that the player with the highest score `c` must have won some games against the other two, and hence, the maximum number of draws is limited by the sum of the scores of the other two players.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where no games are played (`a = b = c = 0`), outputting `0` as expected.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are inconsistent (e.g., `1 1 1`), outputting `-1` as expected.
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws for valid score combinations (e.g., `3 4 5` outputs `6`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws and handles all edge cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
