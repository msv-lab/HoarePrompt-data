### Reasoning:
The program is designed to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and determining the maximum number of draws that could have occurred based on the given scores of the three players. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players, where `a <= b <= c`.

2. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. This is because each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2 to the winner, or 1 to each in case of a draw). If the total points are not even, it's impossible to have a valid set of games that could result in those scores, so the program outputs `-1`.

3. **Draw Calculation**: If the sum is even, the program calculates two values:
   - `x = (a + b + c) // 2`: This represents the total number of games played, because each game contributes 2 points.
   - `y = a + b`: This represents the maximum number of games that could have been played between the first two players, as the third player's score `c` could be from games against either of the first two players.
   
   The maximum number of draws is the minimum of `x` and `y` because the actual number of draws cannot exceed the total number of games, and also cannot exceed the number of games played between the first two players (since the third player's score is not affected by games between the first two players).

4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y` for each test case, or `-1` if the sum of scores is odd.

### Verification with Examples:
- For the input `0 0 0`, the sum is 0 (even), and `x = 0`, `y = 0`, so the output is `0`.
- For the input `0 1 1`, the sum is 2 (even), and `x = 1`, `y = 1`, so the output is `1`.
- For the input `1 1 1`, the sum is 3 (odd), so the output is `-1`.
- For the input `1 1 2`, the sum is 4 (even), and `x = 2`, `y = 2`, so the output is `2`.
- For the input `3 3 3`, the sum is 9 (odd), so the output is `-1`.
- For the input `3 4 5`, the sum is 12 (even), and `x = 6`, `y = 7`, so the output is `6`.
- For the input `1 1 10`, the sum is 12 (even), and `x = 6`, `y = 2`, so the output is `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or to determine if the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games.

**Correctness: True**
