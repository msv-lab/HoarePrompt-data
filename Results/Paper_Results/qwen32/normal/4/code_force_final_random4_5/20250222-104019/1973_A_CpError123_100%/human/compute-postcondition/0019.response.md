The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` will read three integers from the input, split by whitespace, and assign them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. This means the previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are overwritten by the new input values.

The initial state mentioned that `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers from new input and their sum is odd. After the execution of the code, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the new input values, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` will still be odd as per the precondition.

The other variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 30, `t` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers from the new input with their sum being odd, `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is `a + b`.**
