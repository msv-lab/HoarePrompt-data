Output State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 30, `t` is greater than 0, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the third integer from the input, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`; `y` is `a + b`.**

In this output state, the variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `x` retain their initial values or conditions. The variable `y` is newly assigned the value of `a + b`.
