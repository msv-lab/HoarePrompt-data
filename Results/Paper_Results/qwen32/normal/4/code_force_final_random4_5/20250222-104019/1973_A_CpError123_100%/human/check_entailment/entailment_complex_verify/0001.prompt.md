You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        
        y = a + b
        
        print(min(x, y))
        
    #State: p_1, p_2, p_3 remain unchanged, t is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores is even. If the sum is odd, it outputs -1. If the sum is even, it calculates half of the sum and the sum of the first two scores, then outputs the smaller of these two values. The function does not modify the input scores.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Total Points Calculation**: The total points awarded in all games must be even. This is because each game awards a total of 2 points (either 2 to the winner, or 1 to each player in case of a draw).
2. **Maximum Draws**: The maximum number of draws is determined by the total points and the scores of the players. If the total points are `T`, then the maximum number of draws is `T // 2` because each draw awards 2 points.
3. **Constraints on Player Scores**: The scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` must fit into a scenario where the total points are even and the scores can be achieved through valid game results.

### Program Analysis:
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads multiple test cases and the scores for each test case.
- **Total Points Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. If not, it outputs `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total number of points from games.
- **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible number of draws as `(a + b + c) // 2` and compares it with `a + b` (the sum of the two lower scores). The logic here is that the maximum number of draws cannot exceed the sum of the two lower scores because each draw involves two players and the highest score `c` cannot be solely achieved through draws.
- **Output**: The program outputs the minimum of `(a + b + c) // 2` and `a + b`, which correctly represents the maximum number of draws possible under the given constraints.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example inputs:
1. **Input**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: `0`, which is even.
   - Maximum draws: `0 // 2 = 0`.
   - Output: `0` (Correct).

2. **Input**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: `2`, which is even.
   - Maximum draws: `2 // 2 = 1`.
   - Output: `1` (Correct).

3. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: `3`, which is odd.
   - Output: `-1` (Correct).

4. **Input**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: `4`, which is even.
   - Maximum draws: `4 // 2 = 2`.
   - Output: `2` (Correct).

5. **Input**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: `9`, which is odd.
   - Output: `-1` (Correct).

6. **Input**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: `12`, which is even.
   - Maximum draws: `12 // 2 = 6`.
   - Output: `6` (Correct).

7. **Input**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: `12`, which is even.
   - Maximum draws: `12 // 2 = 6`, but `a + b = 2`, so the maximum possible draws is `2`.
   - Output: `2` (Correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given constraints and test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
