Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    x = (a + b + c) // 2
    y = a + b
    print(min(x, y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `p_1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 30, `t` is greater than 0, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the third integer from the input, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`; `y` is `a + b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `p_1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 30, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, `c` is the third integer from the new input, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`; `y` is `a + b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p_1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 30, `t` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers from the new input with their sum being odd, `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is `a + b`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
