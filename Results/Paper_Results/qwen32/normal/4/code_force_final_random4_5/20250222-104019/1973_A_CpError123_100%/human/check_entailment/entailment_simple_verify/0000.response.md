Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Recap:
- Three friends play chess, and the scores are given as `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` such that `p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3`.
- We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have occurred, or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.
- The total points from all games must be an even number because each game contributes either 0, 1, or 2 points.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores.

2. **Odd Total Points Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is impossible under the given scoring rules.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the total score is even, the program calculates `x` as half of the total score `(a + b + c) // 2`.
   - It then calculates `y` as the sum of the two lower scores `a + b`.
   - The program outputs the minimum of `x` and `y`.

### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program before and after the function call, indicating that the scores remain unchanged and `t` is decremented correctly.

### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment claims the program is incorrect based on a counterexample where the input is `0 0 2`.
- The expected output is `0` (no draws), but the program outputs `1`.

### Detailed Reasoning:
Let's re-evaluate the logic with the given counterexample:

- **Input:** `0 0 2`
- **Total Points:** `0 + 0 + 2 = 2` (even, so possible)
- **x:** `(0 + 0 + 2) // 2 = 1`
- **y:** `0 + 0 = 0`
- **Output:** `min(1, 0) = 0`

The program actually outputs `0` for this case, which is correct. The original assessment's counterexample is incorrect.

### Additional Test Cases:
Let's verify a few more test cases:

1. **Input:** `0 0 0`
   - **Total Points:** `0` (even)
   - **x:** `0`
   - **y:** `0`
   - **Output:** `0` (correct)

2. **Input:** `0 1 1`
   - **Total Points:** `2` (even)
   - **x:** `1`
   - **y:** `1`
   - **Output:** `1` (correct)

3. **Input:** `1 1 2`
   - **Total Points:** `4` (even)
   - **x:** `2`
   - **y:** `2`
   - **Output:** `2` (correct)

4. **Input:** `3 4 5`
   - **Total Points:** `12` (even)
   - **x:** `6`
   - **y:** `7`
   - **Output:** `6` (correct)

5. **Input:** `1 1 10`
   - **Total Points:** `12` (even)
   - **x:** `6`
   - **y:** `2`
   - **Output:** `2` (correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the given problem and the counterexample provided in the original assessment is incorrect. The program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws for the provided test cases.

**Final: True**
