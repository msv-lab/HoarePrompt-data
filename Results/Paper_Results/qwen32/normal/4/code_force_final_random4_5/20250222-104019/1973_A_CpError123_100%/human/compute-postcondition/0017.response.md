To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(x, y))` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the calculations involved step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3` are integers between 0 and 30. These variables are not directly used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore them for this task.
   - `t` is a variable that is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1. Again, this variable is not used in the `print` statement.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided as new input. The sum of these integers (`a + b + c`) is odd.
   - `x` is calculated as `(a + b + c) // 2`, which is the integer division of the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` by 2.
   - `y` is calculated as `a + b`.

2. **Objective:**
   - We need to determine the value of `min(x, y)`, which is the minimum value between `x` and `y`.

3. **Calculations:**
   - Since `a + b + c` is odd, `(a + b + c) // 2` will result in an integer that is the floor division of the sum. This means `x` will be an integer that is either `(a + b + c) / 2` rounded down.
   - `y` is simply the sum of `a` and `b`.

4. **Comparison:**
   - To determine which is smaller, `x` or `y`, we need to compare `(a + b + c) // 2` with `a + b`.
   - Given that `a + b + c` is odd, `a + b` is either even or odd.
   - If `a + b` is even, then `(a + b + c) // 2` will be an integer that is less than `a + b` because adding an odd number `c` to an even number `a + b` makes the sum odd, and dividing an odd number by 2 and taking the floor results in a value less than the original sum.
   - If `a + b` is odd, then `(a + b + c) // 2` will still be less than `a + b` because adding another odd number `c` keeps the sum odd, and dividing an odd number by 2 and taking the floor results in a value less than the original sum.

In both cases, `x` will be less than or equal to `y`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the calculations, `min(x, y)` will always be `x` because `(a + b + c) // 2` is always less than or equal to `a + b` when `a + b + c` is odd.

### Final Output:
Output: **x (where x is (a + b + c) // 2 and a + b + c is the sum of the integers a, b, and c which is odd)**
