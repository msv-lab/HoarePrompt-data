The `print(-1)` statement in the provided code snippet will output the integer `-1`. This is independent of the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` as the print statement directly outputs `-1`.

Here's the breakdown:
- The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are defined with certain constraints but are not used in the print statement.
- The print statement explicitly outputs `-1`.

Output: **-1**
