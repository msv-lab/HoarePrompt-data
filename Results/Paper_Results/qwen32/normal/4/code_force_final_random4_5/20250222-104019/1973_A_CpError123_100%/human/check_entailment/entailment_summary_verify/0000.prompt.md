You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores is even. If the sum is odd, it outputs -1. If the sum is even, it calculates half of the sum and the sum of the first two scores, then outputs the smaller of these two values. The function does not modify the input scores.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample:

The logic in the code is as follows:
1. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is not possible with the given scoring rules (each game contributes either 0, 1, or 2 points).
2. If the sum is even, it calculates `x` as half of the total score and `y` as the sum of the lowest two scores.
3. It then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.

However, this logic does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws. Let's consider a counterexample:

**Counterexample:**
Input:
```
1
0 0 2
```
Expected Output:
```
1
```
Explanation:
- The only way to achieve scores of `0, 0, 2` is if the third player won one game against one of the other players. This means there could be a draw in that game, but since the third player has 2 points, it implies they won the game. Therefore, the maximum number of draws is `0` (since there is no draw that could result in a score of `2` for one player while the other two have `0`).

However, the code will output:
```
1
```
This is because:
- `(a + b + c) = 2` which is even.
- `x = (2 // 2) = 1`
- `y = (0 + 0) = 0`
- `min(x, y) = 0` would be the correct answer, but the code incorrectly calculates `min(x, y) = 1`.

Thus, the code fails to correctly compute the maximum number of draws for this case, making it incorrect.

Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
