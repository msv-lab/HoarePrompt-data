Reasoning:  
The program aims to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players after a series of chess games. Here's the step-by-step reasoning to verify the correctness of the program:

1. **Input Validation**: The program first checks if the total number of points `(a + b + c)` is even. This is because each game contributes a total of 2 points (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each player in a draw). If the total number of points is odd, it's impossible to have a valid set of games, hence the program correctly prints `-1`.

2. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - The program calculates `x` as half of the total points `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the maximum number of games that could have been played because each game contributes 2 points.
   - It then calculates `y` as the sum of the points of the two players with the lower scores `(a + b)`. This represents the maximum number of games that could have been played between these two players.
   - The maximum number of draws is the minimum of `x` and `y` because the number of draws cannot exceed the total number of games played, and it also cannot exceed the number of games that could have been played between the two players with the lower scores (since the third player could only have played against these two).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where no games were played (`0 0 0`), resulting in `0` draws.
   - It correctly identifies impossible score combinations (`1 1 1`), resulting in `-1`.
   - It correctly calculates the maximum number of draws for valid score combinations (`3 4 5` results in `6` draws).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correctly implemented based on the problem description and handles the provided test cases accurately.

Correctness: **True**
