Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incomplete Logic**: The program only counts the number of '1's in rows that contain at least one '1'. It then checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal. This logic is insufficient to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle.

2. **Output Mismatch**: The program prints the list `k` instead of printing "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem description.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle various edge cases such as:
    - Triangles that are upside down.
    - Triangles where the central column of '1's is not in the middle.
    - Squares that are not aligned with the left edge of the grid.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
3
001
011
111
```
**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```
**Actual Output:**
```
[1, 2, 3]
```

The program fails to recognize that the given grid forms a triangle and instead prints the counts of '1's in each row.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
