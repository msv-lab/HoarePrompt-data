Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine whether a given binary square grid of size `n x n` contains a specific triangle or square pattern. The triangle pattern has `2*i - 1` consecutive `1`s in the `i`-th row, and the square pattern has `k` consecutive `1`s in each of `k` rows. The program is supposed to output "SQUARE" if the grid contains a square and "TRIANGLE" otherwise.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program does not correctly determine the shape. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n`.
   - It then reads `n` lines of the grid and counts the number of `1`s in each row that has at least one `1`.

2. **Checking the Shape:**
   - The program checks if the count of `1`s in the first two rows (`k[0]` and `k[1]`) is the same.
   - If they are the same, it prints the list `k`. This is not the correct approach to determine the shape of the figure.

3. **Output:**
   - The program does not output "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" based on the correct criteria.

### Issues in the Program
- The program does not check the entire pattern of the grid.
- It only checks the count of `1`s in the first two rows and prints the list `k` if they are the same, which is not a valid way to determine the shape.
- The output does not match the required format of "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

### Correctness
Given the issues mentioned, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
