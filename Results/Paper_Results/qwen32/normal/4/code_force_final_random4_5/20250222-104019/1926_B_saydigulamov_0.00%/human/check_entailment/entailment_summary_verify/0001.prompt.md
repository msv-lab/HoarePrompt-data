You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()

                k.append(b.count('1'))

            print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an n x n binary grid containing exactly one shape made up of '1's. The shape is either a triangle or a square. The function checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows of the grid are equal and prints the counts if they are.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine whether a given binary square grid of size `n x n` contains a specific triangle or square pattern. The triangle pattern has `2*i - 1` consecutive `1`s in the `i`-th row, and the square pattern has `k` consecutive `1`s in each of `k` rows. The program is supposed to output "SQUARE" if the grid contains a square and "TRIANGLE" otherwise.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program does not correctly determine the shape. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n`.
   - It then reads `n` lines of the grid and counts the number of `1`s in each row that has at least one `1`.

2. **Checking the Shape:**
   - The program checks if the count of `1`s in the first two rows (`k[0]` and `k[1]`) is the same.
   - If they are the same, it prints the list `k`. This is not the correct approach to determine the shape of the figure.

3. **Output:**
   - The program does not output "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" based on the correct criteria.

### Issues in the Program
- The program does not check the entire pattern of the grid.
- It only checks the count of `1`s in the first two rows and prints the list `k` if they are the same, which is not a valid way to determine the shape.
- The output does not match the required format of "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

### Correctness
Given the issues mentioned, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
