`b` is assigned the value of the user input, which is a positive integer. The values of `a` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` must be greater than 0, `k` is an empty list, and `b` is a positive integer input by the user.
Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `k` is an empty list, `b` is a positive integer input by the user.**
