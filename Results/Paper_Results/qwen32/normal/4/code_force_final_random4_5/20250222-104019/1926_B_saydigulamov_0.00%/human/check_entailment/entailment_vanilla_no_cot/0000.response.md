Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape formed by the `1`s in the grid is a triangle or a square. Here are some reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Logic for Determining Shape**: The current logic checks if the count of `1`s in the first two rows with `1`s is the same. This is not sufficient to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle.
2. **Output**: The program prints the list `k` instead of printing "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".
3. **Handling of Upside Down Triangles**: The program does not account for upside-down triangles.
4. **Square Detection**: The program does not check if all rows with `1`s have the same count of `1`s and if they are aligned correctly to form a square.
5. **Triangle Detection**: The program does not verify the pattern of `1`s corresponding to a triangle.

To correctly determine the shape, the program should:
- Identify the rows that contain `1`s.
- Check if all these rows have the same count of `1`s and are aligned to form a square.
- Check if the number of `1`s in each row follows the pattern of a triangle (i.e., the i-th row has `2*i-1` `1`s centered in the grid).
- Also handle the case for upside-down triangles.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Find the rows with 1s
        rows_with_ones = [row for row in grid if '1' in row]
        k = len(rows_with_ones)
        
        # Check if it is a square
        is_square = all(row.count('1') == k and row.count('1') == row.count('1', row.index('1')) for row in rows_with_ones)
        
        # Check if it is a triangle
        is_triangle = True
        for i, row in enumerate(rows_with_ones):
            count_ones = row.count('1')
            if count_ones != 2 * (i + 1) - 1:
                is_triangle = False
                break
        
        # Check if it is an upside-down triangle
        is_upside_down_triangle = True
        for i, row in enumerate(reversed(rows_with_ones)):
            count_ones = row.count('1')
            if count_ones != 2 * (i + 1) - 1:
                is_upside_down_triangle = False
                break
        
        if is_square:
            print("SQUARE")
        elif is_triangle or is_upside_down_triangle:
            print("TRIANGLE")
        else:
            print("UNKNOWN")  # This line is just for safety, as per problem statement, one of the shapes will always be present.

func()
```

This program correctly identifies whether the shape is a square or a triangle based on the given criteria.
