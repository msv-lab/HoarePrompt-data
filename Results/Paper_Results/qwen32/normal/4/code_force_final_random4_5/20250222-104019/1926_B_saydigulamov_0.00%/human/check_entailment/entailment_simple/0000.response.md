Reasoning: The provided annotated program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. Let's analyze the code and the problem requirements to understand why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.
2. **Counting '1's**: It counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and stores these counts in the list `k`.
3. **Decision Making**: The program checks if the first two counts in `k` are equal and prints `k` if they are. This is not a valid way to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle.

For a square, the number of '1's should be the same in every row that contains '1's. For a triangle, the number of '1's should increase (or decrease) in a specific pattern: the i-th row should have `2*i - 1` '1's if it's a triangle pointing upwards, or `2*(k-i+1) - 1` '1's if it's a triangle pointing downwards, where `k` is the total number of rows containing '1's.

The provided code does not implement this logic. It simply checks if the first two counts are equal, which is not sufficient to determine the shape.

Correctness: **False**
