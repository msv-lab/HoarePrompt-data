To determine what will be printed, let's break down the variables and their definitions provided in the initial state:

- `cnt`: The number of times k unique characters were encountered in sequence.
- `cur`: A bitmask representing the last incomplete sequence if the last sequence did not complete a set of k unique characters; otherwise, it is 0.
- `i`: Set to `k - 1`.
- `cnt` is less than `n`.
- `ans`: A string composed of `cnt + 1` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of 'a'.
- `tmp`: The character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.

The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`. Based on the definition of `ans`, we can construct the string as follows:

1. `cnt + 1` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.
2. `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of the character 'a'.

The character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` is the k-th character in the alphabet. For example, if `k` is 1, it is 'a'; if `k` is 2, it is 'b'; and so on.

Let's put this into a format that describes the output:

Output: **a string consisting of `cnt + 1` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of 'a' (where `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` is the k-th character in the alphabet)**
