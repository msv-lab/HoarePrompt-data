The given code snippet sets the variable `cur` to 0. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `cur` is reset to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z') and is now specifically `ord(ss) - ord('a')`; `cur` is 0; `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `cur` is reset to 0 (as per the initial state description, but `cur` is now explicitly set to 0 in the code snippet).**
