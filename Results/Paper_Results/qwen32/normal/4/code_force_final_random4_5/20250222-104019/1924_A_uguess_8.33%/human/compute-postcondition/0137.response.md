Postcondition: **`cnt` is the number of times a subset of `k` distinct characters has been encountered in `s`, `cur` is the bitmask of the last set of characters processed before the loop ends, and the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0 (indicating the `i`-th character has not been set in `cur`), `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` is a string of length `cnt` consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times, and `k` is greater than 0.**
