The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` adds a bit to the `cur` variable at the position specified by `cur_ss`. Since `cur` initially does not have the bit at position `cur_ss` set to 1, this operation will set that bit to 1.

Here's the breakdown:
- `cur_ss` is the integer value `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, which represents the position of the first character of the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).
- `1 << cur_ss` creates a binary number with a 1 at the `cur_ss` position and 0s elsewhere.
- `cur += 1 << cur_ss` sets the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` to 1.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `cur`. The other variables (`cnt`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `cur_ss`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `cur` is a number with the bit at position `cur_ss` set to 1, `i` is `t - 2`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character, `cur_ss` is the integer value `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`.**
