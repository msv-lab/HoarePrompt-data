The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` shifts the bit 1 to the left by `cur_ss` positions and adds the result to `cur`. This means the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` will be set to 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5.
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.
- `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z') and is now specifically `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
- The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1.
- If `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1 before the if statement, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `cur` is reset to 0; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `cur` retains its value.
- If `cur` was not equal to (1 << k) - 1, `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `cur` is reset to 0.

After the execution of `cur += 1 << cur_ss`, the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1. Since the initial state already mentions that the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1, the value of `cur` will not change because setting a bit that is already set to 1 does not change its value.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z') and is now specifically `ord(ss) - ord('a')`; The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1; If `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1 before the if statement, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `cur` is reset to 0; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `cur` retains its value. If `cur` was not equal to (1 << k) - 1, `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `cur` is reset to 0. `cur` retains its value.**
