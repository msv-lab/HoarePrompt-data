The code snippet assigns the character 'a' (since `i` is 0 and `chr(ord('a') + 0)` evaluates to 'a') to the variable `tmp`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence. The current value of `cur` does not have the `i`-th bit set (i.e., `cur & 1 << i == 0`). `i` is 0; `cnt` is less than `n`; `tmp` is 'a'; `ans` is a string of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`**
