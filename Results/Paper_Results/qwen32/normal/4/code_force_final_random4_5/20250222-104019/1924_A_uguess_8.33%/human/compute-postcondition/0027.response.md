The code snippet provided initializes the variable `cur` to 0. This action does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `cur` to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty input string; `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the previously processed character; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'); `cur` is 0; `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
