The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `tmp` with an empty string. This does not affect the values of `cnt`, `cur`, `i`, or the condition that `cnt` is less than `n`.

Output State: **`cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence; `i` is `t + 1`; `cnt` is less than `n`; `tmp` is an empty string.**
