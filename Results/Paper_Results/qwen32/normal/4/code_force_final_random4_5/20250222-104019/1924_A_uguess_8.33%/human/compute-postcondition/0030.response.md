Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the input string; `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` distinct characters (in any order) appear consecutively in `s`, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`; `cur` is the state of the bit mask after processing all characters in `s`.**
