The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss`, which iterates over the string `s`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `ss` to the next character in the string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5.
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `s` is a non-empty input string.
- `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
- If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`.
- If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `cur` remains unchanged.
- `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` was processed, and now we need to move to the next character in the string `s` for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty input string; `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the previously processed character.**
