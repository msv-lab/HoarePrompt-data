The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes several variables (`cnt`, `cur`, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `k`) and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string provided in the statement itself.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('NO')`.
2. The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided in the statement and does not depend on the values of any variables.
3. The variables `cnt`, `cur`, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `k` are described in the initial state but are not referenced in the `print` statement.
4. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
