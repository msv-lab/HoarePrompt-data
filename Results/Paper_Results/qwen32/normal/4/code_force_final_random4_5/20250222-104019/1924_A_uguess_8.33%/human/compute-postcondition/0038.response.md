The provided code snippet `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` updates the value of `tmp` based on the value of `i`. Here, `chr(ord('a') + i)` converts an integer `i` to a character starting from 'a'. For example, if `i` is 0, `tmp` becomes 'a'; if `i` is 1, `tmp` becomes 'b', and so on.

Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we can only express `tmp` in terms of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` distinct characters (in any order) appear consecutively in `s`, `cur` is the state of the bit mask after processing all characters in `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is the character 'a' + `i`, `ans` is a string consisting of the k-th letter of the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, and the i-th bit of `cur` is 0.**
