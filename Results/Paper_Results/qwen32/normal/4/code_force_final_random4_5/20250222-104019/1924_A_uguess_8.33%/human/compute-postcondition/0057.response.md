The code snippet provided is:
```python
cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
```
This line calculates the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet, where 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, and so on.

Given the initial state, the variable `ss` is not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer that `ss` is a single character from the string `s`. The variable `cur_ss` is being introduced and assigned a value based on the character `ss`.

Since `ss` is not specified in the initial state, we will assume `ss` is a specific character from the string `s`. The value of `cur_ss` will be an integer between 0 and 25, inclusive, depending on the character `ss`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z').**
