The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` sequences of all `k` distinct characters in any order. If it does, it prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO' followed by a constructed string `ans` that consists of the `k`-th letter of the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, the highest-indexed character not yet encountered in the last incomplete sequence, and 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.
