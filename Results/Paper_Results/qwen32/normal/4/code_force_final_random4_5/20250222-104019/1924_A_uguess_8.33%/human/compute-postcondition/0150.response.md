Postcondition: **`cnt` is the number of times a subset of `k` distinct characters has been encountered in `s`, and `cur` is the bitmask of the last set of characters processed before the loop ends. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function continues without modifying `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string of length `n` consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp` (which is `chr(ord('a') + i)` where `i` is the highest index less than `k` such that the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0), and then `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters.**
