Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` distinct characters (in any order) appear consecutively in `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `cur` & 1 << i == 0, `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + i)`.**
