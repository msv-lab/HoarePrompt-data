Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5. For each test case, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, 1 <= `k` <= 26, and 1 <= `m` <= 1000. The string `s` is of length `m` and consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the input string; `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` distinct characters (in any order) appear consecutively in `s`; `cur` is the state of the bit mask after processing all characters in `s`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function maintains the current state. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + i)` where `i` is the largest integer less than `k` such that the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0; `ans` is a string consisting of the k-th letter of the alphabet repeated `cnt` times followed by `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` remains `t + 1`. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is set to `k - 1`, `ans` is a string of `cnt + 1` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of 'a', and `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cnt` is the number of times a subset of `k` distinct characters has been encountered in `s`, and `cur` is the bitmask of the last set of characters processed before the loop ends. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function continues without modifying `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string of length `n` consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp` (which is `chr(ord('a') + i)` where `i` is the highest index less than `k` such that the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0), and then `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
