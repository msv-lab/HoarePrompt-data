The code snippet `ans += tmp` appends the value of `tmp` to the existing string `ans`. Given that `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, and `ans` is initially a string of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, after the operation, `ans` will have one more occurrence of `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` appended to it.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be a string of `cnt + 1` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`. 

The values of the other variables (`cnt`, `cur`, `i`, `n`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is the number of times k unique characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of k unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence; `i` is k-1; `cnt` is less than n; `ans` is a string of `cnt + 1` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`; `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`**.
