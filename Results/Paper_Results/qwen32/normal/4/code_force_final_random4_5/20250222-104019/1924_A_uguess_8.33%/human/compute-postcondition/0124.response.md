The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` adds the value `1 << cur_ss` to the variable `cur`. Here, `1 << cur_ss` represents a bit shift operation, which effectively sets the bit at position `cur_ss` to 1 in the binary representation of `cur`.

Given the initial state, the value of `cur_ss` is `ord(s[2]) - ord('a')`, which is a specific integer value derived from the ASCII value of the third character of the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The value of `cur` is updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to it.

The values of `cnt`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `ss` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`cnt` is 0 or 1, `i` is `t - 2`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a string read from the input, `ss` is `s[2]`, `cur_ss` is the integer value `ord(s[2]) - ord('a')`, and `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`**.
