The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the variable `cur` by a value determined by a bitwise left shift operation on `1` by `cur_ss` positions. This operation effectively calculates `2` raised to the power of `cur_ss`.

Given the initial state, `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). Therefore, `1 << cur_ss` will be `2^cur_ss`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty input string; `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the previously processed character; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'); `cur` is incremented by `2^cur_ss`.**
