The given code snippet modifies the variable `cur` by adding to it the result of a bitwise left shift operation. The operation `1 << cur_ss` shifts the number 1 to the left by `cur_ss` positions, which is equivalent to \(2^{cur\_ss}\). 

Given the initial state, `cur` is unchanged from the previous iteration, and `cur_ss` is the integer value `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')`. After executing the code, `cur` will be updated to its previous value plus \(2^{cur\_ss}\).

Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `i` is `t - 2`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is `s[1]`, `cur_ss` is the integer value `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')`, `cur` is updated to its previous value plus \(2^{cur\_ss}\).**
