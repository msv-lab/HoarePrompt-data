Postcondition: **`cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence; `i` is 2; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`. If `cur & 1 << i == 0`, `tmp` is 'c'.**
