The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` remains unchanged; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is now equal to `low + 1`; `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
