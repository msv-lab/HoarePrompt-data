To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables involved in the loop condition: `high` and `cur`.

The loop condition is `high >= cur`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must be true. Let's analyze the given state and the loop condition:

- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is initially set to `low` if `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `low + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1` based on the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `high >= cur` is true. Since `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`, we need to ensure that `high` is at least as large as `cur`.

If `cur` is `low`, then `high >= low` should be true by definition since `high` is the maximum of the two differences. If `cur` is `low + 1`, then we need to ensure that `high >= low + 1`.

Since `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `low` is the minimum, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `high` is at least `cur`. If `cur` is `low + 1`, we need to make sure `high` is at least `low + 1`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure `high` is at least `cur`.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and `high` must be at least `cur`**.
