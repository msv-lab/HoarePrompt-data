The provided Python code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The initial state specifies that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and there is a condition regarding the value of `p3` relative to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. However, the code snippet itself does not alter the values of `p1`, `p2`, or `p3` based on any conditions; it merely reads the values from the input.

Given that the code does not modify the values of `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are now known and have been read from the input.

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the current value of `p3` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `p3` remains unchanged as well.**
