Given the initial state, the code snippet `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. 

From the initial state:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` remains unchanged.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` holds true, `cur` remains equal to `low`.
- Otherwise, `cur` is set to `low + 1` and `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

Since the code snippet only increments `cur` by 1, the new value of `cur` will be `cur + 1`. All other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` remains unchanged, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is incremented by 1**.
