Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1`, `p3 - p2` and `high` must be at least `cur` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that the program exits the most internal loop or if statement.
