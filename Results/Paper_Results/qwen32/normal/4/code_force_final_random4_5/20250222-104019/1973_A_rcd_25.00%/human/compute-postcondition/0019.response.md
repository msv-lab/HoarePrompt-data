The only variable in the loop head is `cur`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur` and `high`. If `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- If the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true, `cur` remains equal to `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is set to `low + 1` and `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `cur` must be less than or equal to `high`. Since `cur` can either be `low` or `low + 1` based on the condition, we need to ensure that `high` is at least `low + 1` to guarantee that `cur` can be incremented and still satisfy the loop condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `high` is at least `low + 1`.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` must be at least `low + 1`. If the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true, `cur` remains equal to `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is set to `low + 1` and `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`**
