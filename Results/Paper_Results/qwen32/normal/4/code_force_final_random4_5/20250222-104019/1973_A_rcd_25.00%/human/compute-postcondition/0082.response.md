Postcondition: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` remains unchanged; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `cur` is increased by 1.**
