The only variable in the loop head is `cur` and `high`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `high >= cur`. If this condition is true, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, we have the following information:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` must be at least `low + 1`.
- `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1` depending on the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
- If the condition is not met and the else part is executed, `cur` is incremented by 1.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `high` must be at least `cur + 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust `high` to be at least `cur + 1`.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `high` must be at least `cur + 1`. `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1` depending on the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If the condition is not met and the else part is executed, `cur` is incremented by 1.**
