To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the problem step by step using the provided initial state.

### Given Information:
1. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
2. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
3. `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
4. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
5. `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
6. `cur` is equal to `low`.
7. The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true.

### Calculation Steps:
1. **Determine `low` and `high`:**
   - `low = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`
   - `high = max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`

2. **Set `cur` to `low`:**
   - `cur = low`

3. **Check the condition:**
   - `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`

4. **Print statement:**
   - `print(p1 - cur + p3)`

### Analyzing the Condition:
Given the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, let's simplify it:
- `p1 - cur <= p2 - p3 + cur`
- `p1 + p3 <= p2 + 2*cur`
- `p1 + p3 - p2 <= 2*cur`
- `cur >= (p1 + p3 - p2) / 2`

Since `cur` is set to `low`, and `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, the condition ensures that `cur` is chosen such that the inequality holds.

### Final Expression:
The print statement is `print(p1 - cur + p3)`. Let's substitute `cur` with `low`:
- `p1 - low + p3`

### Understanding the Output:
Given that `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and considering the constraints, the expression `p1 - low + p3` simplifies based on the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and the definitions, the output of the print statement `print(p1 - cur + p3)` can be described as:
- `p1 - low + p3` where `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

Thus, the final output is:
Output: **p1 - low + p3 (where low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2)**
