Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and the tree has exactly two leaves, there is a list of t integers (u_1) where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n representing the starting node of the stone, `numbers` is a list containing two elements, which are lists `[num1, num2]` and `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing the input values. If the length of `nums` is not 2, the values of the variables do not change, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined as there is no else part.**
