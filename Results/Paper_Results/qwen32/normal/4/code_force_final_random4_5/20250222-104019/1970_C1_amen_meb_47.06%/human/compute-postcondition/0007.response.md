Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer where t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and the tree has exactly two leaves, and there is a list of t integers (u_1) where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n representing the starting node of the stone. `numbers` is an empty list, `nums` is a list of strings from the input, `num1` is an integer equal to `int(nums[0])`, and `num2` is an integer equal to `int(nums[1])`.**

In simple terms, after the code execution, the variable `num2` has been assigned the integer value of the second element in the list `nums`. All other variables retain their initial values.
