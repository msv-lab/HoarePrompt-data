The code snippet assigns the integer value of `nums[1]` to the variable `num2`. Therefore, `num2` will now hold the integer value of the second element in the `nums` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and the tree has exactly two leaves, there is a list of t integers (u_1) where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n representing the starting node of the stone, `numbers` is a list containing two elements, which are lists `[num1, num2]` and `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing the input values, `num1` is the integer value of `nums[0]`, `num2` is the integer value of `nums[1]`.**
