Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `t`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `t` is an integer where t=1. It also accepts a tree represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. Additionally, it accepts a list of t integers (u_1) where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n representing the starting node of the stone. The function returns the list `numbers` which contains all the pairs of integers [num1, num2] that were read from the input until a non-pair input was encountered.**
