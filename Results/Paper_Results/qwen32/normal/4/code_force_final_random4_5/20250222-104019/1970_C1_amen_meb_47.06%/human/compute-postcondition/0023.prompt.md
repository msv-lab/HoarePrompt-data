Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer where t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and the tree has exactly two leaves, and there is a list of t integers (u_1) where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n representing the starting node of the stone, `numbers` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    nums = input().split()
    if len(nums) != 2:
        break
    num1 = int(nums[0])
    num2 = int(nums[1])
    numbers.append([num1, num2])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer where t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and the tree has exactly two leaves, and there is a list of t integers (u_1) where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n representing the starting node of the stone. `numbers` is a list containing one element, which is a list `[num1, num2]`. `nums` is a list of strings from the input, `num1` is an integer equal to `int(nums[0])`, and `num2` is an integer equal to `int(nums[1])`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and the tree has exactly two leaves, there is a list of t integers (u_1) where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n representing the starting node of the stone, `numbers` is a list containing two elements, which are lists `[num1, num2]` and `[num1, num2]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and the tree has exactly two leaves, there is a list of t integers (u_1) where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n representing the starting node of the stone, `numbers` is a list containing three elements, which are lists `[num1, num2]`, `[num1, num2]`, and `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing the input values, `num1` is the integer value of `nums[0]`, `num2` is the integer value of `nums[1]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
