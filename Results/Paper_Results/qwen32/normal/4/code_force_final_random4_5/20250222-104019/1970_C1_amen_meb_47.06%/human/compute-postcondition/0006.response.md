The code snippet `num1 = int(nums[0])` converts the first element of the `nums` list to an integer and assigns it to `num1`. Since the length of `nums` is specified to be exactly 2, the conversion will proceed without breaking out of any loops or if statements.

Given the initial state, `nums` is a list of two strings. After the execution of the provided code, `num1` will hold the integer value of the first string in `nums`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer where t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and the tree has exactly two leaves, and there is a list of t integers (u_1) where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n representing the starting node of the stone. `numbers` is an empty list, `nums` is a list of strings from the input, and `num1` is an integer equal to `int(nums[0])`.**
