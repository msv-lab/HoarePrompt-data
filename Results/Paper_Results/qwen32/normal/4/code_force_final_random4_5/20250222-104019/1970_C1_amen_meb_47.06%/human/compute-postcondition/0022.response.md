The given Python code snippet appends a new list `[num1, num2]` to the existing `numbers` list. 

Initial State: 
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5
- `t` is 1
- The tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and the tree has exactly two leaves
- There is a list of t integers (u_1) where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n representing the starting node of the stone
- `numbers` is a list containing two elements, which are lists `[num1, num2]` and `[num1, num2]`
- `nums` is a list of strings representing the input values
- `num1` is the integer value of `nums[0]`
- `num2` is the integer value of `nums[1]`

The code snippet `numbers.append([num1, num2])` adds a new list `[num1, num2]` to the `numbers` list. Therefore, the `numbers` list will now contain three elements: `[num1, num2]`, `[num1, num2]`, and `[num1, num2]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and the tree has exactly two leaves, there is a list of t integers (u_1) where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n representing the starting node of the stone, `numbers` is a list containing three elements, which are lists `[num1, num2]`, `[num1, num2]`, and `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing the input values, `num1` is the integer value of `nums[0]`, `num2` is the integer value of `nums[1]`.**
