The code snippet provided reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which are then assigned to the variable `nums`. The initial state mentions that `numbers` is an empty list, but this list is not affected by the given code snippet. The value of `nums` will be a list of strings corresponding to the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer where t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and the tree has exactly two leaves, and there is a list of t integers (u_1) where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n representing the starting node of the stone, `numbers` is an empty list, `nums` is a list of strings from the input.**
