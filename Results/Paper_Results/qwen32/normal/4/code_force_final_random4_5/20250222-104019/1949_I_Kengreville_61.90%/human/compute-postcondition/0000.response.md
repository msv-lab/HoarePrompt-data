Postcondition: **i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the total number of disks. x, y, and r are lists of length n containing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively. visited is a list of boolean values of length n indicating whether a disk has been visited, and the current value of visited[i] is False. nodes is a list that will store the indices of disks that are part of the current connected component being explored. coef0 and coef1 are lists of length n used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal.**
