The only variable in the loop head is `j` and the iterable is `nodes`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `j` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given that `j` is an element from the `nodes` iterable, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be the next element in the `nodes` iterable.

State: **`c0` is increased by the value of `coef0[j]`; `c1` is increased by the value of `coef1[j]`; `j` is the next element in `nodes`**. 

However, to be more precise, we should specify that `j` is the next element in `nodes` after the current `j` from the previous iteration. Since we don't have the specific values or the type of `nodes` (e.g., whether it's a list, set, etc.), we'll just say `j` is the next element.

State: **`c0` is increased by the value of `coef0[j]`; `c1` is increased by the value of `coef1[j]`; `j` is the next element in `nodes`**.

If we need to be more explicit about the state of `c0` and `c1` at the start of the next iteration, we can say:

State: **`c0` is the value of `c0` after being increased by `coef0[j]` in the previous iteration; `c1` is the value of `c1` after being increased by `coef1[j]` in the previous iteration; `j` is the next element in `nodes`**. 

Given the task constraints, the most accurate and minimal state adjustment is:

State: **`j` is the next element in `nodes`**.
