The code snippet `c1 += coef1[j]` increments the value of `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`. Given the initial state, `c1` is initially set to `0 + coef1[j]`, which simplifies to `coef1[j]` since `c1` is initialized to 0 and then immediately updated to `0 + coef1[j]`. After executing the code, `c1` will be `coef1[j] + coef1[j]`, which simplifies to `2 * coef1[j]`.

Since the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, `i`, and `ok` are not affected by this code snippet, they remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[0]` which is `True`; `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[0]` which is `0`; `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[0]` which is `1`; `nodes` is a list containing `[1]`; `i` is 0; `ok` is False; `c0` is 0; `c1` is `2 * coef1[j]`.**
