Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `True` values with length `n`; `coef0` is a list with each `coef0[i]` set to `0` or `None` if `visited[i]` was initially `True`; `coef1` is a list with each `coef1[i]` set to `1` or `None` if `visited[i]` was initially `True`; `nodes` is a list that is empty at the end of the loop; `i` is `n-1`; `ok` is `True` if at least one `c1` was not equal to `0` during the execution of the loop, otherwise `False`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all iterations:
- `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- `x`, `y`, and `r` lists remain unchanged as they were initially.
- The `visited` list will have all elements set to `True`.
- The `coef0` list will have `0` for indices that were visited during the loop, and `None` for indices that were initially `True` in `visited`.
- The `coef1` list will have `1` for indices that were visited during the loop, and `None` for indices that were initially `True` in `visited`.
- The `nodes` list will be empty at the end of the loop.
- The loop variable `i` will be `n-1`.
- The `ok` variable will be `True` if at least one of the `c1` values was not equal to `0` during the execution of the loop, otherwise it will be `False`.
