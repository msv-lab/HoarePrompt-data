The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 because `j` will range from 0 to `n-1`. The state of `i`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, and `coef1` does not affect whether the loop can execute; it only affects what happens inside the loop.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `n` is greater than 0. The current value of `j` before the loop starts does not matter because it will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length n, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length n, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length n, `n` must be greater than 0**
