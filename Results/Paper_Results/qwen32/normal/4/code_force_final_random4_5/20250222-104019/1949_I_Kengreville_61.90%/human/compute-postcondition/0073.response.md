Postcondition: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element is the first, second, and third integer from the i-th input, respectively; `visited` is a list of `False` values with `visited[1]` set to `True` if it was initially `False`; `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of `None` values with `coef0[1]` and `coef1[1]` possibly updated if `visited[1]` was initially `False`; `nodes` is a list which may have elements added to it; `i` is 2; `c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`; `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`. If `visited[i]` was `False`, `visited[i]` is now `True`, and `coef0[i]` and `coef1[i]` may have been updated, and `ok` is `True` if `c1` is not equal to `0`. If `visited[i]` was `True`, no changes are made to `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, `ok`, `c0`, or `c1`.**
