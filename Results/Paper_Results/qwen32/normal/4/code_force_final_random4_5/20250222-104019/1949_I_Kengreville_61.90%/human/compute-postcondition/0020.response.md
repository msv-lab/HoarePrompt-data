Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length n, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length n, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length n, `n` must be greater than 0, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`. If `visited[j]` is `False` and `(r[i] + r[j])`. `j` is `j + 1`. `dy` is updated to `y[i] - y[j]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `dy` has been recalculated to be `y[i] - y[j]`. All other variables retain their initial states and conditions.
