Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length n, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length n, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length n, `n` must be greater than 0, `dx` is x[i] - x[j], `dy` is y[i] - y[j], `visited[j]` is False, and `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`.**

In simple terms, the only change is in the value of `coef0[j]`, which is now calculated as `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
