Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 0 and `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is 0; `k` is `k - tot`; `L` is a list with at least one element; `pow` is 2 times its previous value; `tot` is `tot + a`; `a` is the next element in the list `L` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change due to the `break` statement, but the execution will exit the most internal loop or if statement.
