The value of `k` is decremented by the value of `tot`. Since `tot` is `tot + a`, the new value of `k` will be `k - (tot + a)`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 1; `n` is 0; `k` is `k - (tot + a)`; `L` is a list with at least one element, `a` is the first element of `L`; `pow` is 1; `m` is 1; `tot` is `tot + a`.**
