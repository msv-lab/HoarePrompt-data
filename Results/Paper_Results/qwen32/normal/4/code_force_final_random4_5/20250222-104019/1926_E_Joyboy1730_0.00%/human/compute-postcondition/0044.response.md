Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 0 and `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is a non-zero integer; `k` is the second integer from the input; `L` is an empty list; `pow` is `2^i` where `i` is the number of iterations completed; `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` up to the point where the loop breaks or finishes; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `m` has been updated to `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables retain their initial values as described.
