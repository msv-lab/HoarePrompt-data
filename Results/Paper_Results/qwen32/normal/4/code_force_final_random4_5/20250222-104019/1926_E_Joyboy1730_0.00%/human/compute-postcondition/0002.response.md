The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. Therefore, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input provided. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1, and `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. Since `n` and `k` are reassigned, their values will reflect the input values, and `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
