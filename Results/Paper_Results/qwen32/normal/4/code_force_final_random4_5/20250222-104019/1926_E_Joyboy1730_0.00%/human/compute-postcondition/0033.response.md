Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 1, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - 2 * tot`, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 4, `tot` is increased by `a` twice, `a` is the next element in `L` after `a_next` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
