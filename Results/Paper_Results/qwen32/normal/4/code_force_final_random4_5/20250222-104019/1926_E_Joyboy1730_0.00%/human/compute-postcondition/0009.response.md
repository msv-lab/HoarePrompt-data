The code snippet `n -= m` modifies the value of `n` by subtracting `m` from it. Given that `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` will be `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The values of `t`, `k`, `L`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1; `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `L` is an empty list; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
