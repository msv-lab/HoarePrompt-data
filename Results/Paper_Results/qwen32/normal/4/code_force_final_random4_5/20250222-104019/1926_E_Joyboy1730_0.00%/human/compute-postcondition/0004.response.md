The `while` loop statement in your task is `while n:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be any non-zero integer. Given the state right before the loop, `n` is already described as an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, which means `n` is guaranteed to be non-zero.

Since `n` is already in a state that allows the loop to execute, no adjustments are needed to the variables in the loop head. The state right before the loop can be repeated as is.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `L` is an empty list.**
