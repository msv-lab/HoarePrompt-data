To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(pow * (2 * k - 1))`, we need to understand the values of `pow` and `k` based on the given initial state.

Here is the breakdown of the variables involved:

1. **`pow`**: The problem states that `pow` is 4 times its previous value. However, the initial value of `pow` is not explicitly given. We can denote its initial value as `pow_initial`. After each iteration, `pow` will be `pow_initial * 4^i`, where `i` is the number of iterations. Without the initial value, we can only express `pow` in terms of its initial value and the number of iterations.

2. **`k`**: The problem states that `k` is `k - 2*tot`. Again, the initial value of `k` is not explicitly given. We can denote its initial value as `k_initial`. After each iteration, `k` will be `k_initial - 2*(tot_initial + a1 + a2 + ... + ai)`, where `a1, a2, ..., ai` are the elements of the list `L` processed up to the current iteration.

3. **`tot`**: The problem states that `tot` is `tot + a`, where `a` is the next element in the list `L`. The initial value of `tot` is not explicitly given. We can denote its initial value as `tot_initial`. After processing each element `a` from `L`, `tot` will be `tot_initial + a1 + a2 + ... + ai`.

4. **`a`**: This is the next element in the list `L`. Since `L` has at least one element, `a` will be the first element of `L` in the first iteration, the second element in the second iteration, and so on.

Given these points, let's express the output in terms of the initial values and the current state of the variables:

- `pow` is `pow_initial * 4^i`
- `k` is `k_initial - 2*(tot_initial + a1 + a2 + ... + ai)`
- `tot` is `tot_initial + a1 + a2 + ... + ai`

The expression to be printed is `pow * (2 * k - 1)`.

Since the exact initial values of `pow`, `k`, and `tot` are not provided, and the exact elements of `L` are not provided, we can only express the output in terms of these variables:

Output: **pow * (2 * (k - 2 * tot) - 1) (where pow is 4 times its previous value, k is k - 2 * tot, and tot is tot + a)**
