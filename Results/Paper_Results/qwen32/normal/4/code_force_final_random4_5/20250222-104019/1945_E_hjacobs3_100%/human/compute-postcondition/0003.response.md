The code calculates the midpoint of the range defined by `l` and `r`. Given the initial state, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n`. The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`, which simplifies to `n // 2` since `l` is 0.

The other variables (`array`, `find`, `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation; `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be at least 2; `l` is 0; `r` is `n`; `mid` is `n // 2`.**
