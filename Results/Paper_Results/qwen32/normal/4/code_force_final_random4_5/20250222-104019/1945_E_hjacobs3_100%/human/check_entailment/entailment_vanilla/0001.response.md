Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to rearrange the permutation `p` such that after performing the binary search algorithm, the element at the index `l` is equal to `x`. The binary search is performed on the array `p`, and after the search, `p[l]` should be `x`. We are allowed to perform at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the number `x` to be found.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` as a list of integers.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to determine the necessary swaps and return them.
   - It initializes `l` and `r` for binary search.
   - It performs the binary search on the array `p` to find the final value of `l`.
   - If `l` is not the index of `x` in the array, it prints `1` and returns the indices to swap `l` with the index of `x`.
   - If `l` is already the index of `x`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.

### Issues in the Program
- **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation:**
  - The binary search is being performed on the original array `p` without any modifications.
  - The binary search relies on the array being sorted, which it is not initially.
  - The binary search should be performed on a modified version of the array after at most 2 swaps.

- **Incorrect Handling of Swaps:**
  - The program only considers one swap if `l` is not the index of `x`.
  - The problem states that two swaps might be necessary, but the program does not account for this.
  - The program does not ensure that after the swaps, the binary search will correctly place `p[l]` at `x`.

- **Output Handling:**
  - The function `func_1` is supposed to return the swaps as strings, but the main loop prints them directly, which is inconsistent with the problem's output requirements.
  - The program does not handle the case where two swaps are needed correctly.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the binary search will place `p[l]` at `x` after at most two swaps. It also does not handle the case where two swaps are necessary.

### Correctness
Correctness: **False**
