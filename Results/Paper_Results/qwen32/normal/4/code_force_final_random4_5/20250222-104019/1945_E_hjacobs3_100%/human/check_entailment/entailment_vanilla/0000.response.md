Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step in the context of the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
   - We need to perform at most 2 swaps on the array to ensure that after applying a binary search, `p_l` (the element at index `l` at the end of the binary search) is equal to `x`.
   - The binary search algorithm is described, and it will terminate when `r - l = 1`, and `p_l` will be the element we are interested in.

2. **Binary Search Behavior**:
   - The binary search algorithm will narrow down the search space by comparing the middle element `p_m` with `x`.
   - If `p_m <= x`, it moves the left pointer `l` to `m`.
   - If `p_m > x`, it moves the right pointer `r` to `m`.
   - The loop ends when `r - l = 1`, and the element at index `l` is the final result of the binary search.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the number `x`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p`.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the permutation and the number `x`.
   - Inside `func_1`, the binary search is performed, and the index `l` is determined.
   - If the element at index `l` is not equal to `x`, it prints `1` and suggests a swap between `l + 1` and the index of `x` in the array.
   - If the element at index `l` is already `x`, it prints `0`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program does not actually perform the swaps; it only suggests them.
   - The program does not guarantee that the binary search will find `x` after the suggested swaps.
   - The program does not handle the case where two swaps are necessary to place `x` at the correct position.
   - The program assumes that after one swap, the binary search will find `x`, which is not always true.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. It only suggests one swap and does not ensure that the binary search will find `x` after the suggested swap. It also does not handle the case where two swaps are necessary.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
