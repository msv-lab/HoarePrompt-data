### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to rearrange a permutation such that a binary search algorithm will correctly identify the index of a given number \( x \) in the permutation. The program uses a function `func_1` to determine whether any swaps are needed and to output the appropriate swap operations if necessary.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - The binary search is initialized with `l = 0` and `r = n`.
   - The loop continues until `r - l = 1`.

2. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
   - If `array[mid] <= x`, then `l` is updated to `mid`, otherwise `r` is updated to `mid`.

3. **Post-Binary Search Check**:
   - After the loop, `l` should be the largest index such that `array[l] <= x`.
   - The program checks if `l` is equal to the index of `x` in the array.
   - If they are not equal, it means the array is not in the correct order for the binary search to find `x` at `l`, and a swap is needed.
   - The program outputs `1` and the indices to swap to correct the order.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `l` is already equal to the index of `x`, no swaps are needed, and the program outputs `0`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program assumes that a single swap is sufficient to correct the array for the binary search, but the problem states that up to 2 swaps may be necessary.
- The provided solution does not handle cases where two swaps are required to position `x` correctly.
- The program outputs the swap indices directly within the function, which is not in line with the problem's requirement to print the number of operations first, followed by the operations themselves.

### Correctness:
Given that the program does not account for scenarios requiring two swaps and directly prints the swap operations within the function, it does not fully meet the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: False**

The program is not correct because it does not handle all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement, specifically the cases where two swaps are necessary.
