The code snippet `l = mid` updates the value of `l` to be equal to `mid`. Given that `mid` is initially `n // 2`, after executing the code, `l` will hold the value `n // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is `n // 2`, `r` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`**.
