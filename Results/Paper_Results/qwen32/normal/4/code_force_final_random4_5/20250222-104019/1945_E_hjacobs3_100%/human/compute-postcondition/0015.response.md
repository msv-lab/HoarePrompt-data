The code snippet updates the value of `mid` to be the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2. Given the initial state, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n`. Therefore, `mid` is recalculated as `(0 + n) // 2`, which simplifies to `n // 2`.

The other variables (`array`, `find`, `n`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`**.
