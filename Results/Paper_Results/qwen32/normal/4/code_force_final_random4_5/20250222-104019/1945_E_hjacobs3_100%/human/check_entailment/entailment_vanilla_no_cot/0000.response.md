Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that after performing at most two swaps, the binary search will result in `p_l` being equal to `x`. The current implementation only checks if `l` is equal to the index of `x` and performs at most one swap if it is not, which is insufficient to guarantee the correct result for all cases.

The program needs to implement a strategy to perform up to two swaps to ensure that the binary search will correctly identify `x` as the value at `p_l`. The current logic does not account for the need to sort parts of the array or to correctly place `x` in a position that will be identified by the binary search algorithm.
