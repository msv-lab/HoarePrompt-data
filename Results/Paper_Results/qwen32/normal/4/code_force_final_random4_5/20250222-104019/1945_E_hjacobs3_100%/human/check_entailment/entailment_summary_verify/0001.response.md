### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the given program based on the problem description, the provided function summary, and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap
We need to rearrange a permutation `p` such that after performing a binary search, the element at index `l` is equal to `x`. We can perform at most 2 swaps to achieve this. The binary search is performed on the array `p` as described, and we need to ensure that `p[l]` equals `x` after the search.

#### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one by calling `func_1`. The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the necessary swaps to ensure that after the binary search, `p[l]` equals `x`.

#### Function Summary Recap
The function `func_1` takes a permutation `array` and an integer `find`. It performs a binary search on the array to determine the final value of `l`. If `l` is not the index of `find`, it prints `1` and returns the indices to swap `l` with the index of `find`. If `l` is already the index of `find`, it prints `0`.

#### Issues Identified in the Program
1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search is performed on the original, unsorted array `p`. This is incorrect because binary search requires a sorted array.
   - The binary search should be performed on a modified version of the array after at most 2 swaps.

2. **Handling of Swaps**:
   - The program only considers one swap if `l` is not the index of `x`. However, the problem states that two swaps might be necessary.
   - The function does not ensure that after the swaps, the binary search will correctly place `p[l]` at `x`.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return the swaps as strings, but the main loop prints them directly, which is inconsistent with the problem's output requirements.
   - The program does not handle the case where two swaps are needed correctly.

#### Verification Against Function Summary
The function summary describes the behavior of `func_1` accurately in terms of its output states and return values. However, the function itself does not address the core issue of ensuring that the binary search will correctly place `p[l]` at `x` after at most two swaps.

#### Conclusion
The program does not correctly solve the problem because:
- It performs binary search on an unsorted array.
- It does not account for the possibility of needing two swaps.
- It does not ensure that the binary search will correctly place `p[l]` at `x` after the swaps.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
