The variable `n` is assigned the length of the list `array`. The length of `array` is the number of integers in the permutation, which is `n`. The other variables, `array` and `find`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation; `n` is the length of `array`.**
