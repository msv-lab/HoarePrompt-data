Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements. The main issues are:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in the `func_1` function is incorrect. The `l` and `r` variables are initialized to `0` and `n` respectively, but the binary search should be performed on a sorted array. The provided code does not sort the array before performing the binary search, and even if it were, the logic for swapping elements is flawed.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The logic for swapping elements is not correctly implemented. The program checks if the element at index `l` is equal to `x` after the binary search, but it does not ensure that the array is in a state where binary search can correctly find `x` after at most two swaps.

3. **Output Format**: The output format is incorrect. The program should output the number of swaps followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped, but it does not handle the case where two swaps are necessary.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as when `x` is the first or last element of the permutation, or when `x` is not present in the permutation (which is not possible as per the problem statement, but the program should still handle it gracefully).

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
5 4 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1 3
2 4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
3 2
```

The program only performs one swap and does not correctly rearrange the array to ensure that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position after at most two swaps. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
