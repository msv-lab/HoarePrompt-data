The value of `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`. All other variables retain their previous values. Specifically, `b` was initially `p[p[original_b] - 1] - 1`, and now it becomes `p[p[p[original_b] - 1] - 1] - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `k - 2`, `s-1` are integers obtained from the input, `b` is `p[p[p[original_b] - 1] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * (k + 2))`, `s` is `p[p[original_b] - 1] - 1`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
