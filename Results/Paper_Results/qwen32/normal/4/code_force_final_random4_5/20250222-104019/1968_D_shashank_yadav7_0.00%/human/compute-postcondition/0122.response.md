The code snippet `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by the value of `a[s]`. Given the initial state, `sp` was initially `a[s]`, so after the operation, `sp` becomes `a[s] + a[s]`, which is `2 * a[s]`.

Here are the variables that remain unchanged: `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `t`, `i`, `a`, `bp`, `sm`, `bm`, and `p`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `min(n-1, initial_k - 1) + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `sm` is `a[s]`, `bm` is `a[b]`, and `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
