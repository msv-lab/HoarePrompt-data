`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. This means `t` now holds the number of test cases, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. The values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a` remain unchanged as they are specific to each test case and have not been initialized or modified in this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` are as defined in the initial state.**
