Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. The logic for updating the scores and positions is incorrect. The program should add the value of `a` at the current position to the respective player's score on each turn, and then decide whether to stay or move based on the values of `a` at the current and next positions. However, the program incorrectly adds `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` to the scores, which does not reflect the correct game mechanics.

2. The program incorrectly updates `bp` and `sp` by adding `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively on each turn, instead of adding the value of `a` at the position they decide to stay at or move to.

3. The program does not correctly handle the case where the players stay at their current positions or move to `p_x`.

4. The loop that runs `n` times is incorrect. The game only lasts `k` turns, so the loop should run `k` times, not `n` times.

5. The program does not correctly handle the case where `k` is very large (up to \(10^9\)). The loop running `k` times would be too slow and would result in a timeout.

To fix the program, you need to implement the correct logic for updating scores and positions, and handle the large `k` case efficiently, possibly by detecting cycles in the permutation and calculating the scores for the cycles directly.
