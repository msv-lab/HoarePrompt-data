The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `p`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers, with `t` being a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `i` being 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are obtained from the input but are not further specified in the initial state.

After executing the code, the list `p` will contain the integers from the input. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged unless they are specifically modified later in the code, which is not shown here.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers obtained from the input, and `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
