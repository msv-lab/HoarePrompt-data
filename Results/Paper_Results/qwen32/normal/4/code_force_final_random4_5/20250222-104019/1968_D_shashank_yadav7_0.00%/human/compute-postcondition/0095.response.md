The `print('Bodya')` statement will output the string 'Bodya' regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `sm`, `bm`, or `p`. The print statement is a simple output operation that does not depend on any of these variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state provides numerous variables and their relationships, but it does not affect the `print('Bodya')` statement.
2. **Print Statement**: The `print('Bodya')` statement is a direct output of the string 'Bodya'.

Since the print statement does not depend on any of the variables or their values, the output is straightforward.

Output: **Bodya**
