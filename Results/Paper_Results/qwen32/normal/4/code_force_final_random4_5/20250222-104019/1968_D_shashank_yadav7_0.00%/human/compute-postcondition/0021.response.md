The code snippet `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by `a[b]`. Given the initial state, the value of `bp` is initially `a[b]`. After the operation, `bp` will be `a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `2 * a[b]`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the if condition was met, otherwise `k` retains its original value, `s-1` are integers obtained from the input, `b` is `p[original_b] - 1` where `original_b` is the initial value of `b`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`.**
