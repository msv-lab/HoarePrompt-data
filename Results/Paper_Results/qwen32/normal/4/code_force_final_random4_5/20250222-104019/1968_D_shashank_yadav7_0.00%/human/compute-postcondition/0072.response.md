The code snippet provided increments the value of `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `bp` is `a[b] - 1`
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input

After executing `bp += a[b]`, the new value of `bp` will be:
- `bp` becomes `a[b] - 1 + a[b]` which simplifies to `2 * a[b] - 1`

The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` is true, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b] - 1`, `sm` is `a[s] * (k + 1) + max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`, `bm` is `a[b] + max(a[b], bp)`**
