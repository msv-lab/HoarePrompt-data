Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the if condition was met, otherwise `k` retains its original value, `s-1` are integers obtained from the input, `b` is `p[original_b] - 1` where `original_b` is the initial value of `b`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sp * (k - 1)`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `bm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`. All other variables retain their initial values.
