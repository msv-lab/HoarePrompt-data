The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variables `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Given that `t` is already described as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0**
