The given code modifies the value of `sm` by adding the result of `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` to it. Let's break down the impact of this code on the variables.

Given:
- `sm` is initially `a[s] * (k + 1) + max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`
- `a[s]` is an element from the list `a` at index `s`
- `k` is -1
- `sp` is `2 * a[s]`

First, let's simplify the initial value of `sm`:
- Since `k` is -1, `a[s] * (k + 1)` becomes `a[s] * 0` which is `0`.
- `a[s] * k + sp` becomes `a[s] * -1 + 2 * a[s]` which simplifies to `a[s]`.
- Therefore, `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)` simplifies to `max(0, a[s])` which is `a[s]` because `a[s]` is a positive integer.
- Thus, `sm` is initially `0 + a[s]` which is `a[s]`.

Now, let's evaluate the expression `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`:
- `sm` is `a[s]`.
- `a[s] * k + sp` is `a[s] * -1 + 2 * a[s]` which simplifies to `a[s]`.
- Therefore, `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` simplifies to `max(a[s], a[s])` which is `a[s]`.

Finally, `sm` is updated to `sm + a[s]`, which means `sm` becomes `a[s] + a[s]` or `2 * a[s]`.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b] - 1`, `sm` is `2 * a[s]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp) + bm`**.
