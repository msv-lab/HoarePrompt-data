Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. `i` is `n` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise it is the value of `i` when `k` becomes 0. `n` is the number of iterations the loop was supposed to run. `k` is 0 if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise it is the value of `k` when the loop breaks. `s` is updated based on the values in the list `p` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0. `b` is updated based on the values in the list `p` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0. `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `sp` accumulates the values from the list `a` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0. `bp` accumulates the values from the list `a` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0. `bm` accumulates the maximum values based on the current `bp` and `sp` along with the values from the list `a` and the current value of `k` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0. `sm` accumulates the maximum values based on the current `bp` and `sp` along with the values from the list `a` and the current value of `k` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0. Additionally, `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.**
