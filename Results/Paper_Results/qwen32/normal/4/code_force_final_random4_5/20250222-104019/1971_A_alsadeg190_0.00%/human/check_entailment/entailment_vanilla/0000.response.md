Reasoning:  
The given program is intended to solve the problem as described. However, there is a logical error in the print statements inside the loop. The program is supposed to print the minimum of x and y followed by the maximum of x and y. But in the current implementation, if `x > y`, it prints `x` first, which is incorrect. It should print `y` first in that case. The correct print statements should be:

- If `x > y`, print `y` then `x`.
- If `x <= y`, print `x` then `y`.

The current implementation does the opposite, which means it does not correctly output the minimum and maximum values in the required order.

Correctness: **False**
