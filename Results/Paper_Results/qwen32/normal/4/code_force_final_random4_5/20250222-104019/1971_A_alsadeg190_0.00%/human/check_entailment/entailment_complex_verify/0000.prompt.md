You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    1 4
    3 4
    0 2

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each of the t test cases, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the last input pair, `y` is the second integer from the last input pair such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9, and `i` is equal to `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, and prints the larger of the two integers followed by the smaller one.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly output the minimum and maximum values for each test case. Specifically, the `if` condition in the loop is incorrect. It should print the minimum value first, followed by the maximum value. However, the current code prints `x, y` when `x > y`, which is incorrect because it should be `y, x` in that case. Similarly, when `x <= y`, it should print `x, y`, but the code does the opposite. 

Here is the corrected version of the code for clarity:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)
```

In the provided code, the condition `if x > y` is flawed because it prints the larger number first, which is not what the problem description requires. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
