Let's analyze the given task step by step:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. However, `t` is not used in the provided print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- `x` is the first integer from the new input. The exact value of `x` is not specified, so we will refer to it as `x`.
- `y` is the second integer from the new input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9. The exact value of `y` is also not specified, so we will refer to it as `y`.
- `i` is `i + 1`. However, `i` is not used in the provided print statement, so it does not affect the output.

The print statement is:
```python
print(x, y)
```

Given that `x` and `y` are the first and second integers from the new input respectively, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **x, y (where x is the first integer from the new input and y is the second integer from the new input)**
