Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `x` is the first integer from the new input.
- `y` is the second integer from the new input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the print statement).

The `print(y, x)` statement will output the value of `y` followed by the value of `x`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can only describe their values based on the given conditions.

Output: **y, x (where y is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9 and x is the first integer from the new input)**
