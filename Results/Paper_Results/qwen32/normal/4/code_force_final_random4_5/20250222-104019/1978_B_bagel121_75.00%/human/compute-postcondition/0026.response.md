Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`; `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`; `_` is incremented by 1. The calculations for `k`, `ans`, and `p2` are performed regardless of whether `a >= b` or not.**

This postcondition summarizes that the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain as per the precondition, and the calculations for `k`, `ans`, and `p2` are executed irrespective of the condition `a >= b`. The variable `_` is incremented by 1 in both cases.
