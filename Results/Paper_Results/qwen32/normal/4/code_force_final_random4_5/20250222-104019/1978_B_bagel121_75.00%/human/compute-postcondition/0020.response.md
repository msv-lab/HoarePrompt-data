The provided code snippet reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. This means the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated based on the input. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `ans`, `p2`, and `_`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`; and `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`; `_` is incremented by 1.**
