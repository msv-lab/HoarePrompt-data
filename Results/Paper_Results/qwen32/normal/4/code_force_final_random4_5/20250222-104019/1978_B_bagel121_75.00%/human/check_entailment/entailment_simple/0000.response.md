### Reasoning:

To determine if the program is correct, we need to verify that it computes the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selling all `n` buns according to the promotion rules.

1. **Case 1: `a >= b`**
   - If the usual price of a bun `a` is greater than or equal to the price of the first bun `b`, it is optimal for Bob to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the promotion price `(b - i + 1)` would be less than or equal to `a` for all `i`.
   - The total profit in this case would be `n * a`.
   - The code correctly handles this case with the condition `if a >= b: print(n * a)`.

2. **Case 2: `a < b`**
   - If the usual price of a bun `a` is less than the price of the first bun `b`, Bob should consider selling the first `k` buns at the modified price to maximize profit.
   - The optimal value of `k` is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at a price higher than `a`, which is `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
     \[
     \text{Profit from first } k \text{ buns} = \frac{(b + (b - k + 1)) \times k}{2}
     \]
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a` is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two profits.
   - The code correctly computes this with:
     ```python
     k = min(b - a + 1, n)
     ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
     p2 = (n - k) * a
     print(ans + p2)
     ```

The code correctly handles both cases and computes the maximum profit for each test case as described in the problem statement.
