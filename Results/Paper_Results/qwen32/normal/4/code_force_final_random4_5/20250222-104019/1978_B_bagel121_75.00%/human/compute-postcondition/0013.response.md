To determine what will be printed by the `print(n * a)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the logic leading up to the print statement:

1. **Inputs**:
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable represents the number of test cases, but it is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
   - `n`, `a`, and `b`: Integers read from the input.

2. **Logic**:
   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, then:
     - `k` is calculated as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
     - `ans` is calculated as `int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`.
     - `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
   - `_` is incremented by 1 (though this variable is not used in the provided code snippet).

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement `print(n * a)` is executed.

Given the above logic, the value that will be printed is simply the product of `n` and `a`. The calculations for `k`, `ans`, and `p2` do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Therefore, the output will be the product of the integers `n` and `a`.

Output: **n * a (where n and a are integers read from the input)**
