You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints a value based on the relationship between `a` and `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, and adds this to the product of `(n - k)` and `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Understanding:
Bob wants to maximize his profit from selling `n` buns. The first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1`, and the remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price of `a` coins each. We need to find the maximum possible profit.

### Key Observations:
1. If `a >= b`, selling all buns at the usual price `a` will always yield the maximum profit because the modified price will not be higher.
2. If `a < b`, we need to determine the optimal `k` to maximize profit. The profit from the first `k` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and ending at `b-k+1`. The remaining `n-k` buns are sold at `a`.
3. The sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: \(\text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})\).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program correctly implements the above logic:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- If `a >= b`, it calculates the profit as `n * a`.
- If `a < b`, it calculates the optimal `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
- It then calculates the profit from the first `k` buns using the arithmetic series sum formula and adds the profit from the remaining `n-k` buns sold at `a`.
- Finally, it prints the total profit for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and follows the optimal strategy to maximize the profit. Therefore, the program is correct.
