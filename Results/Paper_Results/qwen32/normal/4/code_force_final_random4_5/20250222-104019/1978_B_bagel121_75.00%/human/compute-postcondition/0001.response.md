To ensure the for loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head contains the variable `_` and `t`. The variable `_` is a common placeholder for a loop variable that we do not intend to use within the loop body. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4

There is no need to adjust the state of `t` because it is already defined and within the valid range. The loop will execute `t` times as long as `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted since it is just a placeholder and does not influence the execution of the loop.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
