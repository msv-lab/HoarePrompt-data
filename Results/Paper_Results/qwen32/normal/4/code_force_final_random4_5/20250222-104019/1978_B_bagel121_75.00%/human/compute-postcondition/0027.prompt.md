Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a >= b:
        print(n * a)
    else:
        k = min(b - a + 1, n)
        ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
        p2 = (n - k) * a
        print(ans + p2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then the current values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`; and `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then the current values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`; and `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`. In both cases, `_` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`; `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`; `_` is incremented by 1. The calculations for `k`, `ans`, and `p2` are performed regardless of whether `a >= b` or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
