To determine the output of the `print(ans2)` statement, we need to understand the context provided by the initial state:

1. **`i` is `x-1 + k`**: This tells us how `i` is calculated in terms of `x` and `k`, but it does not directly affect the value of `ans2`.
2. **`ans1` is the value after the final update in the `k`-th iteration**: This indicates that `ans1` is updated in each iteration, and we are interested in its value after the `k`-th iteration.
3. **`ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` encountered during the `k` iterations**: This means `ans2` keeps track of the highest value `ans1` reaches during the `k` iterations.

Given this information, the `print(ans2)` statement will output the maximum value that `ans1` took during the `k` iterations.

Since we do not have the specific values of `x`, `k`, or the exact updates to `ans1` in each iteration, we can only describe `ans2` in terms of the maximum value `ans1` reached.

Output: **ans2 (where ans2 is the maximum value of ans1 encountered during the k iterations)**
