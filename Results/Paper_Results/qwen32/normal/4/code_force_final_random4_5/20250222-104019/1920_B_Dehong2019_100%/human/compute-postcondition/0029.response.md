The code updates `ans2` to be the maximum of `ans1` and its previous value. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0; `x` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; if `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[2] - a[2 + x] * 2`; otherwise, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[2]`; `ans2` is the maximum of the updated `ans1` and its previous value; `i` is 2.**
