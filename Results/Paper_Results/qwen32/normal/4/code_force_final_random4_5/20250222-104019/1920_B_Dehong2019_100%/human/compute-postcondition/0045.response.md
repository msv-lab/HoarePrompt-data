The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` modifies the value of `ans1` by adding the element at index `i` of the list `a` to it. Given that `a` is a sorted list in descending order, the specific value added to `ans1` depends on the index `i`. However, since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we can only express the new value of `ans1` in terms of `a[i]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. `ans2` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is the first input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is the third input integer, `a` is a sorted list in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` multiplied by 2 plus `a[i]`, `ans2` is the same as `ans1` before the increment.**
