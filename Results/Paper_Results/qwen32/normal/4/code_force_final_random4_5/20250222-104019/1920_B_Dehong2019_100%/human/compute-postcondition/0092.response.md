Output State: **t** remains the same; **n**, **k**, **x** remain the same for each test case; **a** remains the same for each test case; **ans1** is the value after the final update in the last iteration of the inner loop for the current test case, which has added `a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `k-1` and subtracted `a[i + x] * 2` whenever `i + x < n` for the last test case; **ans2** is the maximum value of **ans1** encountered during the **k** iterations for the current test case.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop are complete, the state is such that:
- The number of test cases `t` remains unchanged.
- For each test case, the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same as they were initially provided for that test case.
- The sorted array `a` also remains unchanged.
- `ans1` holds the final value calculated after the last iteration of the inner loop for the current test case, reflecting the sum of the array with the specified additions and subtractions.
- `ans2` holds the maximum value of `ans1` that was observed during the `k` iterations of the inner loop for the current test case, which is the optimal result for that test case.

This state represents the completion of all test cases and the final results for each one.
