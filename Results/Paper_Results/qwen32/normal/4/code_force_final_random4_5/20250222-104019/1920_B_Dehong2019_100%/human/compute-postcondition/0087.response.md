The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1`. The other variables (`k`, `i`, `ans2`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `ans2` is the maximum value between `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`
- `ans1` is `ans1` plus `a[i]`

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans1` is now `ans1` minus `a[i + x] * 2`

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `ans2` is the maximum value between the previous `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`; `ans1` is the previous `ans1` plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2`.**
