The code snippet `ans1 = sum(a)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `ans1`. This change does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, or `ans2`. The list `a` remains a sorted list in descending order.

Output State: **`t` remains the same; `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `x` is the third input integer; `a` is now a sorted list in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` observed during the iterations.**
