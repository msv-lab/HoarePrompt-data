Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0; `x` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus the first element of `a` minus `2 * a[x]`; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`; `i` remains 0. Otherwise, there are no changes to `ans1`, `ans2`, or `i`.**

In simpler terms, the output state means that `ans2` is now the maximum value between `ans1` and its previous value, while all other variables retain their initial values or calculated states as described.
