Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0; `x` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[1] - 2 * a[1 + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[1]`; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`; `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `ans2` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `ans1`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
