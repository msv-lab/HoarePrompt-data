Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is the third input integer, `a` is a sorted list in descending order, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[i]` if `i + x` is not less than `n`; otherwise, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[i] - a[i + x] * 2`. `ans2` is calculated as per the given conditions.**
