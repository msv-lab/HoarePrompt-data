Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= `k` <= `n`, and 1 <= `x` <= `n`. The array `a` contains `n` integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 1000 for each `i`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

In simpler terms: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of an input integer, which is the number of test cases. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
