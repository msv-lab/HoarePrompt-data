Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `x` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list in descending order of the integers from the latest input, `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a` minus `2 * a[0]` minus `2 * a[1]` minus `2 * a[2]` and so on until `2 * a[x-1]`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, `i` is `x-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    ans1 += a[i]
    if i + x < n:
        ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
    ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is greater than 0; `ans1` is incremented by `a[i]`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is further decremented by `a[i + x] * 2`. `a` and `i` remain unchanged; `ans2` is the maximum value between the previous `ans1` and `ans2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is greater than 0; `i` is `i_end + 1`; `ans2` is the maximum value between `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `ans1` is the previous `ans1` plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1` is the previous `ans1` plus `a[i]`; `ans2` is the maximum value between the previous `ans1` and the previous `ans2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
