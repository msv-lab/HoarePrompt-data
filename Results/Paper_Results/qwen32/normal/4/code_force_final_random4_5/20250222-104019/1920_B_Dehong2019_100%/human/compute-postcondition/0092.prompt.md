Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= `k` <= `n`, and 1 <= `x` <= `n`. The array `a` contains `n` integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 1000 for each `i`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
    ans1 = sum(a)
    for i in range(x):
        ans1 -= a[i] * 2
    ans2 = ans1
    for i in range(k):
        ans1 += a[i]
        if i + x < n:
            ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
        ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)
    print(ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains the same; `n`, `k`, `x` remain the same; `a` remains the same; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements plus the sum of the first `k` elements minus twice the sum of the elements from position `x` to `x + k - 1` (if these positions are within the bounds of the list); `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` observed during the iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t remains the same; n is the first input integer; k is the second input integer; x is the third input integer; a is a sorted list in descending order; ans1 is the result of the final update in the loop, where it has added `a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `k-1` and subtracted `a[i + x] * 2` whenever `i + x < n`; ans2 is the maximum value of ans1 observed during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `x-1 + k`, `ans1` is the value after the final update in the `k`-th iteration, `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` encountered during the `k` iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
