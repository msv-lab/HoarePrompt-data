The value of `f` is decremented by 1. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer that has been decreased by 1, and `k` is an integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer, `f` is `f - 1`, `k` is an integer.**
