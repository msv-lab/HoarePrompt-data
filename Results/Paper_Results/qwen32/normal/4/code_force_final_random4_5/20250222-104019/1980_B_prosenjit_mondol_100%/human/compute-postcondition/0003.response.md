The value of `k` is decremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `f` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer, `f` is `f - 1`, `k` is `k - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer, `f` is `f - 1`, `k` is `k - 1`.**
