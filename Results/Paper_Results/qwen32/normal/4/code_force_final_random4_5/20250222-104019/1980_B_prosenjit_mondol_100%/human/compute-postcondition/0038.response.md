Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the second input integer minus 2, `k` is the third input integer minus 2, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input and sorted in descending order, `x` is `a[f]` in the sorted list. If `a[k] < x`, the condition remains the same as before. Otherwise, the condition is true if `a[k]` is greater than `a[f+1]` in the sorted list; otherwise, it is false.**
