The value of `x` is assigned the value of the element at index `f` in the list `a`. Since `f` is `f - 1`, it means `x` will be assigned the value of the element at index `f - 1` in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer, `f` is `f - 1`, `k` is `k - 1`, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `x` is `a[f - 1]`.**
