The code takes an input string, splits it into three parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k` respectively. The initial state of `t` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers derived from the input string.**
