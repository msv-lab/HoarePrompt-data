Let's break down the provided initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Explanation:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100 (though `t` is not directly used in the provided code snippet, it might be related to the number of test cases or iterations).
- `n` is the number of elements in list `a`.
- `m` is the number of elements in list `b`.
- `temp` is an index such that 0 <= temp <= n. It is set to the index where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is met for the first time. If no such condition is met, `temp` is set to -1.
- `ans` is a list that contains:
  - `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for `i` from 0 to `temp-1`.
  - If a break occurred (i.e., `temp` is not -1), it also includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` from `temp` to `n-1`.
- `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input.
- `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(ans))
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - `b` is sorted in descending order.
   - `temp` is initially set to -1, indicating no break condition has been met yet.
   - `ans` is initialized as an empty list.

2. **Loop through `a` and `b`**:
   - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the code checks if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`.
   - If the condition is met, `temp` is set to `i`, and the loop breaks.
   - If no such condition is met, `temp` remains -1.

3. **Building `ans`**:
   - If `temp` is -1 (no break occurred), `ans` is filled with `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - If `temp` is not -1 (break occurred), `ans` is filled with:
     - `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for `i` from 0 to `temp-1`.
     - `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` from `temp` to `n-1`.

4. **Summing `ans`**:
   - The `print(sum(ans))` statement calculates the sum of all elements in the `ans` list.

### Output:
The output will be the sum of the absolute differences calculated based on the conditions described. If no break condition is met, it will be the sum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If a break condition is met, it will be the sum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for `i` from 0 to `temp-1` plus the sum of `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` from `temp` to `n-1`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **sum(ans) (where ans is a list of absolute differences as described above)**
