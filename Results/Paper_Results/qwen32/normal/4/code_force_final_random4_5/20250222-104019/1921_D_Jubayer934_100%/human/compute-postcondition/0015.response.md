Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `i + 1`. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1. `ans` is a list containing `abs(a[i] - b[i])`.**
