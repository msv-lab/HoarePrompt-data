The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is typically used as a throwaway variable in Python when the loop variable is not needed. The loop iterates `int(input())` times, which means the loop will execute based on the integer value provided by the input.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5.
- `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.
- `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9.
- The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The loop will execute `int(input())` times. To ensure the loop executes, the input must be an integer that is at least 1. Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, we can use `t` as the input to the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, the input to the loop is `t`**

This ensures that the loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is between 1 and 100 inclusive.
