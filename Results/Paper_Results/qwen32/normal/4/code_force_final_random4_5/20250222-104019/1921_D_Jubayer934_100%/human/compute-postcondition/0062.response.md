Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the number of elements in list `a` and must be greater than `temp`, `m` is the number of elements in list `b`, `temp` is an index such that 0 <= temp < n, `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for `i` from 0 to `temp-1` and now also includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` from `temp` to `temp + 2`, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `temp + 3`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` has been updated to include the absolute difference between `a[temp + 2]` and `b[-(n - (temp + 2))]`. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1 to `temp + 3`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
