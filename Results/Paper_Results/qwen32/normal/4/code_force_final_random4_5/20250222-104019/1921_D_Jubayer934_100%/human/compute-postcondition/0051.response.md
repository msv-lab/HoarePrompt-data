The code snippet `temp = i` assigns the value of `i` to `temp`. This means that `temp` will now hold the value of `i`, regardless of its previous value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `ans`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `temp` is `i`, `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `i + 1`.**
