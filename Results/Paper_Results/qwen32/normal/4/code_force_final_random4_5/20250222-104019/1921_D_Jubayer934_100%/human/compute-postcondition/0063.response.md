To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `ans` list. The loop starts from `i = temp` and continues until `i < n`. In each iteration, it appends `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to the `ans` list.

Given the initial conditions and the states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue until `i` reaches `n-1`. Therefore, the final state of `ans` will include `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`.

Here's the final output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the number of elements in list `a`, `m` is the number of elements in list `b`, `temp` is an index such that 0 <= temp < n, `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for `i` from 0 to `temp-1` and now also includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` from `temp` to `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, the `ans` list will have the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for the first `temp` elements, and then it will have the absolute differences between elements of `a` starting from index `temp` and elements of `b` starting from the end (in reverse order) until the end of `a`.
