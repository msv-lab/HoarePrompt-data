Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `temp` is `i`, `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, and `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `temp` is updated to `i`. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
