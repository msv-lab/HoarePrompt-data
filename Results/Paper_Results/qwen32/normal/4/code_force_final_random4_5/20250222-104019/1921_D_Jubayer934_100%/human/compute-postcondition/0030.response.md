To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables.

The loop iterates over the range starting from `temp` to `n`. In each iteration, it calculates the absolute difference between the `i`-th element of the sorted list `a` and the element of the sorted list `b` at the position `-(n - i)` and appends this difference to the list `ans`.

Given the pattern of the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue until `i` reaches `n-1` (or until the condition `i < n` is no longer satisfied).

### Output State after All Iterations:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.
- **`m`**: Remains unchanged as it is used to determine the index in `b`.
- **`temp`**: Remains unchanged as it is the starting point of the loop.
- **`ans`**: Will contain `min(n, n)` absolute differences, which simplifies to `n` differences, since `temp` is less than `n` and the loop runs until `i` reaches `n-1`.
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged as it is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input.
- **`b`**: Remains unchanged as it is a sorted list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than `temp`, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is the index `i` where the loop broke and is not -1 and must be less than `n`, `ans` is a list of `n` absolute differences, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the list `ans` will contain `n` absolute differences, each calculated as the difference between an element from the sorted list `a` and a corresponding element from the sorted list `b` in reverse order, starting from the index `temp` to `n-1`.
