Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is the index `i` where a certain condition was first met (and is not -1), `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences calculated up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all `n` iterations, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the new input, sorted in descending order.**
