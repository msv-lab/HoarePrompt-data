The code snippet `ans = []` reassigns the variable `ans` to an empty list. This means that any previous values or elements in `ans` are discarded.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.**
