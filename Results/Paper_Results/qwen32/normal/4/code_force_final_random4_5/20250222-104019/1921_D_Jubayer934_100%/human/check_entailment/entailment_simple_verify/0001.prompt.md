You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `m` are the lengths of the lists `a` and `b` respectively. `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, and `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers in descending order. `temp` is either -1 or the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was met during the inner loop. `ans` is a list of absolute differences calculated as follows: for each index `i` from 0 to `temp-1`, `ans` includes `abs(a[i] - b[i])`. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` also includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for each index `i` from `temp` to `n-1`. The final output for each test case is the sum of all elements in `ans`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) where \( c_i \) is chosen from a set of \( m \) integers \( b_i \) (with \( m \geq n \)).

### Strategy to Maximize \( D \)
To maximize \( D \), the optimal strategy is to match the largest elements of \( b \) with the smallest elements of \( a \) and vice versa. This way, the absolute differences are maximized.

### Analysis of the Provided Program
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It then reads the arrays \( a \) and \( b \).

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array \( a \) is sorted in ascending order.
   - The array \( b \) is sorted in descending order.

3. **Greedy Selection:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the differences.
   - It iterates through the first \( n \) elements of \( a \) and \( b \).
   - For each element \( a[i] \), it compares the absolute differences between \( a[i] \) and the smallest remaining element of \( b \) (`b[-(n - i)]`) and the largest remaining element of \( b \) (`b[i]`).
   - If \( |a[i] - b[-(n - i)]| > |a[i] - b[i]| \), it breaks the loop and starts using the smallest elements of \( b \) from that point onward. This is incorrect because the initial assumption that the first few elements should be matched with the largest elements of \( b \) is flawed. The correct approach is to always try to maximize the difference for each element.
   - If not, it appends the difference \( |a[i] - b[i]| \) to `ans`.

4. **Summing Differences:**
   - The program sums up the differences stored in `ans` and prints the result.

### Issues in the Program
- The logic for choosing between the largest and smallest elements of \( b \) is incorrect. The program should always aim to maximize the difference for each element, not just for the first few elements.
- The program does not correctly handle the case where the largest elements of \( b \) should be paired with the smallest elements of \( a \) and vice versa.

### Correct Approach
- Sort \( a \) in ascending order.
- Sort \( b \) in descending order.
- Pair the smallest element of \( a \) with the largest element of \( b \), the second smallest element of \( a \) with the second largest element of \( b \), and so on.
- Compute the sum of the absolute differences for these pairs.

### Corrected Program
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)
        ans = sum(abs(a[i] - b[i]) for i in range(n))
        print(ans)

func()
```

### Conclusion
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for choosing between the largest and smallest elements of \( b \). The corrected approach should always pair the smallest elements of \( a \) with the largest elements of \( b \) and vice versa.

Correctness: **False**
