To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop operates and how it affects the variables involved.

The loop in question is:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```
The loop variable `j` iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Each iteration of the loop prints two lines, but these print statements do not affect the variables `sum`, `n`, `j`, or `t`. The variable `t` is not modified within the loop, and `sum` is not changed inside the loop either.

Given the initial state:
- `sum` is \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\)
- `n` is the input integer
- `j` is initially `n + 1` (but this is overridden by the loop)
- `t` is 2

The loop iterates `n` times, and at the end of the loop, `j` will have taken on the value `n + 1` (one more than the last value it was assigned in the loop).

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is:
- `sum` remains \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\)
- `n` remains the input integer
- `j` is `n + 1`
- `t` remains 2

Output State: **`sum` is \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\), `n` is the input integer, `j` is \(n + 1\), `t` is 2.**

In simple terms, the value of `sum` stays the same as it was initially, `n` remains unchanged, `j` ends up being one more than the input integer `n`, and `t` remains 2.
