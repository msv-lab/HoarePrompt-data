The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4 and `n` must be at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 5, and `n` must still be at least 4.

State: **`sum` is updated by adding 28 to it, `n` must be at least 4, `j` is 6, `t` is 1, `i` is 5**
