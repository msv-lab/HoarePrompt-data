Output State: **`sum` is 95, `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n + 1`, `t` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to be the input integer. The values of `sum`, `j`, and `t` remain unchanged. The variable `j` is dependent on the new value of `n`, so it will be `n + 1` where `n` is now the input integer.
