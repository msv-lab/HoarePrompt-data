Let's break down the print statement and determine the exact output based on the given initial state.

The print statement is:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `sum` is 95 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 7 (we don't know the exact value, but it must be at least 7).
- `j` is 7.
- `t` is 1 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).

Let's analyze the print statement step by step:

1. The first argument to `print` is `1`. This is a constant and will be printed as is.
2. The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 7, this simplifies to `n - 7 + 1`, which is `n - 6`. Since `n` must be at least 7, the smallest possible value for `n - 6` is 1.
3. The third part of the print statement is `*range(1, n + 1)`. The `*` operator unpacks the elements of the range into separate arguments to the `print` function. The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.

Let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` (which is 7) to illustrate the output:
- If `n` is 7, then `n - j + 1` becomes `7 - 7 + 1 = 1`.
- The range `range(1, n + 1)` becomes `range(1, 8)`, which generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

So, the print statement would be:
```python
print(1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
```

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7**
