Let's break down the print statement and the initial state provided:

1. `sum` is given as 95, but it is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific task.
2. `n` must be greater than or equal to 7. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we will assume the smallest possible value, which is 7, for the purpose of this explanation.
3. `j` is given as 7.
4. `t` is given as 1, but it is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific task.

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's evaluate each part of the print statement:

1. The first argument is the integer `2`.
2. The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given `n = 7` and `j = 7`, this evaluates to `7 - 7 + 1 = 1`.
3. The third part is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Since `n = 7`, this will unpack the range `range(1, 8)`, which is equivalent to the sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7`.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output:
```
2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
```

Output: **2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7**
