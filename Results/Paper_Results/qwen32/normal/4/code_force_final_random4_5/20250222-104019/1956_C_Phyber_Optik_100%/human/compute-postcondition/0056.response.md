Let's break down the provided initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `sum` is calculated using the formula \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is set to 1.
- `t` is set to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Argument (`1`)**:
   - This is a constant value `1`.

2. **Second Argument (`n - j + 1`)**:
   - Given `j` is `1`, the expression simplifies to `n - 1 + 1 = n`.

3. **Third Argument (`*range(1, n + 1)`)**:
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator unpacks this range into individual arguments for the `print` function.

### Combined Output:
- The `print` function will output the value `1` (first argument), followed by `n` (second argument), and then the sequence of numbers from `1` to `n` (third argument).

### Final Output:
Since `n` is not explicitly given a value, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **1, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
