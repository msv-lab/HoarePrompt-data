The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is not explicitly used in the loop body and is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use), and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1, so for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.

However, in this specific case, the loop is designed to run only once because `t` is initialized to 1 and does not change within the loop. Therefore, after the first iteration, `t` would still be 1, but the loop condition `_ in range(t)` would no longer be satisfied because `range(1)` has only one element, and the loop has already iterated over it.

Since the loop is intended to run only once, there is no need to adjust the state to make it execute again. But if we were to consider the hypothetical scenario where we want to adjust the state to make the loop execute one more time, we would need to increment `t`.

State: **`sum` is 95, `n` is the input integer, `j` is `n + 1`, `t` is 2**
