To determine the output, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

Initial State:
- `sum` is calculated using the formula \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `j` is \(n + 1\).
- `t` is 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print(sum, n + n)
```

Let's break down the values:

1. `sum` is given by the formula \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\).
2. `n + n` is simply \(2n\).

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we will express the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **\(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\), 2n (where \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\) is the sum calculated using the formula and 2n is twice the value of n)**
