#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b in the tree.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b in the tree, and `g` is a list of empty lists with a length of `n + 1` where each `g[a]` contains all vertices `b` such that there is an edge between `a` and `b`, and each `g[b]` contains all vertices `a` such that there is an edge between `a` and `b`.
    c = 0
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: - `l` will be greater than `r`.
    #- `r` will be the largest value of `mid` for which `check(mid)` returned `True`.
    #- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `edges`, `g`, `c`) remain unchanged.
    #
    #Output State:
    print(r)
    #This is printed: r (where r is the largest value of mid for which check(mid) returned True)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed, and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple represents an edge connecting two vertices. It calculates and prints the largest value `r` such that the tree can be divided into `r` connected components by removing at most `k` edges.
