Postcondition: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree where `g[1]` must contain at least one more node, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < number of vertices in `g`. If `node` is not equal to `p`, `stack` is `[(1, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)]`. Otherwise, `stack` remains `[(1, 1)]`. `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is 0, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, and `node` is 4.**
