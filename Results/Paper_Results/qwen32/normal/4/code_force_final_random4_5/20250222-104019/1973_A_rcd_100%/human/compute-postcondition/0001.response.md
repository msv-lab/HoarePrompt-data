In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times. The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are mentioned as part of the state but are not directly involved in controlling the loop's execution. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute at least once if we want the loop to run.

Given the constraints:
- `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`

The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` do not affect the loop's execution directly, but they should remain within the specified range (0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30) as per the problem statement.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `t` to be at least 1. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` can remain as they are, provided they meet the given constraints.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30**
