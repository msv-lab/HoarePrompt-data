To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

Given:
- `t` is at least 1.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
- `x` is initialized to 0.
- `y` is initialized to `p3`.
- The condition `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y` holds true.

The `print` statement in question is:
```python
print(p1 - x + p3)
```

Let's break down the expression `p1 - x + p3`:

1. `x` is explicitly given as 0.
2. `y` is explicitly given as `p3`, but `y` is not used in the print statement.
3. The expression `p1 - x + p3` simplifies to `p1 - 0 + p3`, which further simplifies to `p1 + p3`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the value of `p1 + p3`.

Output: **p1 + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers read from the input)**
