To determine the final output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop terminates and what the final values of `x` and `y` will be.

### Analysis of the Loop

The loop condition is `while y >= x`. The loop body modifies `x` and `y` based on the condition `if p1 - x <= p2 - y`:

1. **If `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true:**
   - The loop prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - The final output is `p1 - x + p3`.

2. **If `p1 - x > p2 - y` is true:**
   - `x` is incremented by 1.
   - `y` is decremented by 1.
   - The loop continues until the condition `y >= x` is no longer satisfied.

### Determining the Final Output State

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

- After 1 iteration, `x` is 1 and `y` is `p3 - 1` if `p1 - x > p2 - y`.
- After 2 iterations, `x` is 2 and `y` is `p3 - 2` if `p1 - x > p2 - y` continues to be true.
- After 3 iterations, `x` is 3 and `y` is `p3 - 3` if `p1 - x > p2 - y` continues to be true.

The loop terminates when `y < x`. Therefore, the final values of `x` and `y` will be such that `y` is just less than `x`.

### Final Output State

The loop will continue to decrement `y` and increment `x` until `y` is no longer greater than or equal to `x`. The final state will be when `x` is just greater than `y`.

- If `p1 - x <= p2 - y` becomes true at any point, the loop breaks and prints `p1 - x + p3`.
- If `p1 - x > p2 - y` continues to be true, the loop will terminate when `y < x`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, the final output state will be determined by the point at which `p1 - x <= p2 - y` becomes true or when `y` is no longer greater than or equal to `x`.

### Conclusion

The loop will print `p1 - x + p3` if `p1 - x <= p2 - y` becomes true at any point. Otherwise, it will print `p3` when `y < x`.

Since the loop continues to decrement `y` and increment `x` until `y < x`, the final output will be `p3` if `p1 - x > p2 - y` for all iterations until `y < x`.

**Output State: p3**

In natural language: The final output state is `p3` when the loop terminates because `y` is no longer greater than or equal to `x` and the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` was never true during the iterations.
