The provided code snippet only initializes the variable `x` to 0. No other variables are modified or used in the code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, and they hold the values read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. Additionally, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. `x` is 0.**
