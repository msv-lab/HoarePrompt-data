Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement with `x` remaining 0 and `y` equal to `p3`. Otherwise, `x` is set to 1 and `y` is set to `p3 - 1`.**
