To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is at least 1 (but its value is not used in the print statement).
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
- If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program does not change the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(p1 + p2)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is `print(p1 + p2)`, which means we need to calculate the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- The value of `p3` is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- The condition that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being odd does not change the values of `p1` and `p2`, so we can directly use the values of `p1` and `p2` as they are.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are the integers read from the input)**
