The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The initial state specifies that `t` is at least 1, and `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30. After executing the code, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will hold the values read from the input, and the constraints on these values will still hold.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, and they hold the values read from the input.**
