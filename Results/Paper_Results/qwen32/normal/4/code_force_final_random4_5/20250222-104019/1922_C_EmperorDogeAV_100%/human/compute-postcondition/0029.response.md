Postcondition: **`cities` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case with `n` cities, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` as the coordinates of the cities, `m` is the number of queries, and `x_i, y_i` are the queries. `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros except `prog_cities[i]` which is 1 if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`; otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is `abs(forward - cities[i])`. If `i > 0`, `back` is set to `cities[n - 2]`. If `i` is not greater than 0, `back` remains `-99999999999999999999`. `forward` is `999999999999999999` in both cases.**
