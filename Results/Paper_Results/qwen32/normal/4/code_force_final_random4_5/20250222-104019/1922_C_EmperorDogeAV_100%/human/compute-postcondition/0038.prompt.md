You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case and contains the following elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities, a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities, an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) representing the number of queries, and a list of m pairs of integers x_i, y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city in each test case, the closest city is determined uniquely.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` elements where each element `prog_cities[i]` is set based on the closest city to `cities[i]`:
    #- If `cities[i + 1]` is closer to `cities[i]` than `cities[i - 1]`, then `prog_cities[i]` is `1`.
    #- Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is the distance to the next city `cities[i + 1]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, for each city (except the last one), we determine whether the next city is the closest one. If it is, we mark that position in `prog_cities` with `1`. If the closest city is not the next one, we store the distance to the next city in `prog_cities`.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns `prog_cities`, a list of `n - 1` elements where each element `prog_cities[i]` is either `1` if `cities[i + 1]` is closer to `cities[i]` than `cities[i - 1]`, or the distance to the next city `cities[i + 1]` otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `cities`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case includes the number of cities `n`, a list of coordinates for these cities, the number of queries `m`, and a list of query pairs. For each city in each test case, the function determines whether the next city is closer than the previous city and returns a list of `n - 1` elements. Each element in this list is either `1` if the next city is closer, or the distance to the next city otherwise.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `prog_cities`, a list of `n - 1` elements where each element `prog_cities[i]` is either `1` if `cities[i + 1]` is closer to `cities[i]` than `cities[i - 1]`, or the distance to the next city `cities[i + 1]` otherwise.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
