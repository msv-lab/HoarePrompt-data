cities is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case and contains the following elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities, a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities, an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) representing the number of queries, and a list of m pairs of integers x_i, y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city in each test case, the closest city is determined uniquely.
