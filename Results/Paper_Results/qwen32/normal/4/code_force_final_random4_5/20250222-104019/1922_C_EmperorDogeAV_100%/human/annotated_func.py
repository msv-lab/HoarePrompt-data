#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case and contains the following elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities, a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities, an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) representing the number of queries, and a list of m pairs of integers x_i, y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city in each test case, the closest city is determined uniquely.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` elements where each element `prog_cities[i]` is set based on the closest city to `cities[i]`:
    #- If `cities[i + 1]` is closer to `cities[i]` than `cities[i - 1]`, then `prog_cities[i]` is `1`.
    #- Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is the distance to the next city `cities[i + 1]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, for each city (except the last one), we determine whether the next city is the closest one. If it is, we mark that position in `prog_cities` with `1`. If the closest city is not the next one, we store the distance to the next city in `prog_cities`.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns `prog_cities`, a list of `n - 1` elements where each element `prog_cities[i]` is either `1` if `cities[i + 1]` is closer to `cities[i]` than `cities[i - 1]`, or the distance to the next city `cities[i + 1]` otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of city coordinates and determines for each city (except the last one) whether the next city is the closest city. If the next city is the closest, it marks that position in the result list with `1`. Otherwise, it stores the distance to the next city in the result list. The function returns this list of `n - 1` elements.
