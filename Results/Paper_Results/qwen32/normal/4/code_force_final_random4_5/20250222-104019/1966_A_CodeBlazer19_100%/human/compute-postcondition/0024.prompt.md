Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 2 <= `k` <= 100. `c` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `c_i` <= 100 for each `i` in the range 1 to `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
    if max(p) >= k:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        print(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input; `p` is a list of integers representing the frequency of each unique element in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the maximum value in `p` is indeed greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `i` is 1; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a new list of integers read from the input; `p` is a list of integers representing the frequency of each unique element in `l`. The maximum value in `p` is either greater than or equal to `k` or less than `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `i` is 2; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a new list of integers read from the input; `p` is a list of integers representing the frequency of each unique element in `l`, where each element in `p` is the count of a unique element in `l`. The program does not modify any of these variables based on the if-else condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
