The code snippet `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]` updates the list `p` to contain the frequency of each unique element in the list `l`. 

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `i` is 2; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a new list of integers read from the input; `p` is a list of integers representing the frequency of each unique element in `l`, where each element in `p` is the count of a unique element in `l`.**

In simpler terms, `p` now holds the frequency of each distinct number in the list `l`.
