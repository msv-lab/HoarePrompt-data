The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `i` is 1; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input; `p` is a list of integers representing the frequency of each unique element in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the maximum value in `p` is indeed greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`.**
