Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-2 ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `x` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order as read from the input; `i` is `x`; `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i] - a[i + x] * 4 + a[i]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` remains `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i] + a[i]`; `ans2` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop; `k` is greater than 0. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is recalculated as `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i] - a[i + x] * 4 + a[i]`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i] + a[i]`.**

Note: There seems to be a discrepancy in the provided if part postcondition where `ans1` is recalculated with `a[i + x] * 4` instead of `a[i + x] * 2` as in the precondition. The provided answer reflects the calculation as per the if part postcondition.
