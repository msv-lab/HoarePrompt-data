Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; the array `a` contains n integers sorted in descending order where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the array `a`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `ans1` is now the sum of all elements in the array `a`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
