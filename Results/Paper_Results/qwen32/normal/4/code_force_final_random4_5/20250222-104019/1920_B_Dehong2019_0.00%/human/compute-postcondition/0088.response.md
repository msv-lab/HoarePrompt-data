Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-2 ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `x` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order as read from the input; `i` is `x + 1`; `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 2 * a[i] - a[i + x] * 6` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 3 * a[i] - a[i + x] * 2` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 3 * a[i]`; `ans2` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop; `k` is greater than 0.**

To summarize in natural language: `t` remains an integer within the specified range, and `n`, `k`, `x` retain their initial values. The list `a` remains sorted in descending order. The variable `i` is `x + 1`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is recalculated as `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 2 * a[i] - a[i + x] * 6`; otherwise, it is recalculated as `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 3 * a[i] - a[i + x] * 2` if `i + x` is less than `n` (which is not possible in this case), otherwise `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 3 * a[i]`. The variable `ans2` remains `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`. The variable `ans` is updated to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop. The variable `k` remains greater than 0.
