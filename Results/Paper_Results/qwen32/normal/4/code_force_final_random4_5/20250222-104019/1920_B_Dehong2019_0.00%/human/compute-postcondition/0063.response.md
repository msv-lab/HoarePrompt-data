The code snippet provided reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x` from the input. This affects the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` but does not change the values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, or `ans`. The list `a` and the integer `t` remain unchanged, and the variable `i` is still defined as `k + x - 1`. The variables `ans1`, `ans2`, and `ans` are also not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-2 ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order as read from the input; `i` is `k + x - 1`; `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k + x - 2]) + sum(a[0:k]) - 2 * sum(a[x:k+x])`; `ans2` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k + x - 2])`; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop**.
