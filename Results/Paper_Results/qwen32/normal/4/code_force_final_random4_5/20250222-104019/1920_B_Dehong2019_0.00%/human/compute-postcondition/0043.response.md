The code snippet provided assigns the value of `ans1` to `ans2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, `ans1`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order as read from the input; `i` is `k + x - 1`; `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k + x - 2])`; `ans2` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k + x - 2])`; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop.**
