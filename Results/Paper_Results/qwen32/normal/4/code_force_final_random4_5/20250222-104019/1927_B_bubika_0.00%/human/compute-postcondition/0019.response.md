To determine the output of the `print(r)` statement, we need to understand how the variable `r` is constructed based on the provided initial state.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`b` has incremented values at certain indices**: This means that there are specific indices in the list `b` where the values have been incremented.
2. **`r` is a string formed by concatenating elements from `a` based on the indices of elements in `s` within `b`**: This suggests that there is a list `a`, a list `b`, and a list `s`. The variable `r` is created by taking elements from `a` where the indices correspond to the positions of elements from `s` in `b`.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Identify the elements in `s` within `b`**: We need to find the indices in `b` where the elements of `s` are located.
2. **Use these indices to select elements from `a`**: Once we have the indices, we use them to pick elements from `a`.
3. **Concatenate these elements to form `r`**: The selected elements from `a` are concatenated to form the string `r`.

### Example Scenario:
Let's assume the following for the sake of clarity:
- `a = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']`
- `b = [10, 20, 30, 40]`
- `s = [20, 40]`

In this scenario:
- The element `20` is at index `1` in `b`.
- The element `40` is at index `3` in `b`.

Using these indices, we select elements from `a`:
- Element at index `1` in `a` is `'banana'`.
- Element at index `3` in `a` is `'date'`.

Concatenating these elements, `r` becomes `'bananadate'`.

### General Description:
Without the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `s`, we can only describe `r` in terms of these variables. The string `r` is constructed by concatenating elements from `a` where the indices correspond to the positions of elements from `s` in `b`.

### Final Output:
Output: **r (where r is a string formed by concatenating elements from `a` based on the indices of elements in `s` within `b`)**
