Output State: **`r` is `3 * a[x]`, `b` has incremented values at those indices with `b[x]` increased by 2, `t` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, `i` is the third element in `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated to be `3 * a[x]` because `r` was initially `2 * a[x]` and then `a[x]` is added to it, making it `3 * a[x]`. The values of `b`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.
