Given the initial state that the code will raise a NameError due to undefined variables `b` and `i`, we should focus on the provided code snippet `r += a[x]` and determine the impact on the variables.

However, the code snippet `r += a[x]` will also raise a NameError if `r` or `a` or `x` are not defined. Since the initial state specifically mentions `b` and `i` as undefined, but does not mention `r`, `a`, or `x`, we assume that the intention is to focus on the impact of the given line, even though it will raise an error.

If we hypothetically assume that `r`, `a`, and `x` were defined, then `r` would be updated to `r + a[x]`. Since the actual values of these variables are not provided, we cannot specify the exact new value of `r`. However, based on the task requirements, we should describe the output state as it would be if no errors were raised.

Output State: **The code will raise a NameError due to undefined variables `b` and `i`. If `r`, `a`, and `x` were defined, `r` would be updated to `r + a[x]`.**

In simpler terms, the output state acknowledges the error due to `b` and `i` being undefined, and describes the hypothetical change to `r` if all variables were defined.
