The code snippet `r += a[x]` modifies the value of `r` by adding the value of `a[x]` to it. Given the initial state, `r` is initially `2 * a[x]`. After executing this line, `r` will be `2 * a[x] + a[x]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[x]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Specifically:
- `b` still has incremented values at the indices corresponding to the elements in `s` with the value at index `x` increased by 2.
- `t` is still `X + len(s)`.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `s` remains a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element.
- `x` is still `b.index(i)`.
- `i` is still the next element in `s` after `s[x]`.

Output State: **`r` is `3 * a[x]`, `b` has incremented values at the indices corresponding to the elements in `s` with the value at index `x` increased by 2, `t` is `X + len(s)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element, `x` is `b.index(i)`, `i` is the next element in `s` after `s[x]`.**
