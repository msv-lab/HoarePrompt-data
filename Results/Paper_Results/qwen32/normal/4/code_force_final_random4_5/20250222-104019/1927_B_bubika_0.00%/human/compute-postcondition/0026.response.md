To determine the output state, we need to understand the effect of the code `r += a[x]` given the initial state. Here's the breakdown:

- `r` is an empty string initially.
- `b` has incremented values at those indices.
- `t` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer.
- `x` is the index of `n` in `b`.

The code `r += a[x]` suggests that `r` is being concatenated with the element at index `x` of list `a`. However, `a` is not defined in the initial state. Since `a` is not mentioned, we can assume that `a` is a predefined list of characters or strings, and `x` is the index in this list corresponding to the value `n` found in list `b`.

Given that `r` was initially an empty string, after executing `r += a[x]`, `r` will hold the value of `a[x]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`r` is `a[x]`, `b` has incremented values at those indices, `t` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the index of `n` in `b`.**
