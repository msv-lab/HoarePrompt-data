To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, let's analyze the loop step-by-step.

The loop iterates over the list `costs` which contains two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This means the loop will execute exactly twice because there are two elements in `costs`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### First Iteration:
- `i` is `n - k + 1`
- `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`
- `h` is incremented by `curr` (`h += curr`)
- `n` is updated by subtracting `i * curr` (`n -= (n - k + 1) * curr`)

After the first iteration, `n` becomes `n - (n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`. If `n - k + 1` is a divisor of `n`, then `n` becomes `k - 1`.

### Second Iteration:
- `i` is `1`
- `curr` is `n // 1` which is `n`
- `h` is incremented by `curr` (`h += n`)
- `n` is updated by subtracting `i * curr` (`n -= 1 * n`)

After the second iteration, `n` becomes `0`.

### Final Output State:
- `n` is `0` because after the second iteration, `n` is completely reduced to `0`.
- `h` is the sum of the quotients from each iteration. Initially `h` is `0`. After the first iteration, it is incremented by `curr` which is `n // (n - k + 1)`. After the second iteration, it is incremented by `n` which is now `k - 1`. Therefore, `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + (k - 1)`.
- `k` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop.
- `costs` remains `[n - k + 1, 1]` as it is not modified in the loop.
- `curr` and `i` are undefined after the loop ends as they are loop variables.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **n is 0, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, costs is [n - k + 1, 1], h is n // (n - k + 1) + (k - 1).**

In simple words, after the loop completes, `n` becomes `0`, `k` remains unchanged, `costs` remains unchanged, and `h` is the sum of the quotients from each iteration of the loop.
