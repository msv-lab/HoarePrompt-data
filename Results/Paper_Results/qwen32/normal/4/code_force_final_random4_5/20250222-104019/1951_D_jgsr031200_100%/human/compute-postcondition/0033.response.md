Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}). It prints "YES" followed by 1 and 1 if `n` is equal to `k`. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it performs some calculations and prints "YES" followed by 2 and two values (the first being `n - k + 1` and the second being 1) if a certain condition is met; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value.**
