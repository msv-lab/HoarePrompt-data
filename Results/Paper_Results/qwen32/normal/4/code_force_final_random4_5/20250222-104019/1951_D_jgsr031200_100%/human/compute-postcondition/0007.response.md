Given the initial state, we know that `n` and `k` are positive integers with the conditions 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18} and n is not equal to k. Additionally, it is specified that the current value of `n` is less than `k`.

The Python code snippet provided is:
```python
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement in the code explicitly prints the string 'NO'. The values of `n` and `k` do not affect the output of this particular `print` statement because the string 'NO' is hardcoded and does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **NO**
