The provided code snippet includes the line `curr = n // i`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not defined, the code will raise a `NameError`. To address this, I will assume that `i` was intended to be a variable with a specific value, but since it is not provided, I will not be able to compute the exact value of `curr`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the only variable that could potentially change is `curr`. Since `i` is undefined, `curr` cannot be calculated, and thus no change occurs to the state of the variables `n`, `k`, `costs`, and `h`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}. n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list containing the values `[n - k + 1, 1]`. `h` is 0. `curr` is undefined due to `i` being undefined.**
