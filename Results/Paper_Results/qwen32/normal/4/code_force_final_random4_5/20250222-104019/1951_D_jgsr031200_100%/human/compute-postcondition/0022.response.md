The code snippet `h += curr` adds the value of `curr` to `h`. Given the initial state, `curr` is `n` and `h` is `curr`, which means `h` is also `n`. After the operation, `h` will be `n + n`, which simplifies to `2 * n`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `-n`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `2 * n`, `curr` is `n`, `i` is `1`**.
