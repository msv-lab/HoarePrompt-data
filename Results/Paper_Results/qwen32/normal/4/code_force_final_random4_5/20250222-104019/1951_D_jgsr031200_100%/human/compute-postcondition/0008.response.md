Output State: **The program does not return any value.**

Explanation: The provided Python code snippet contains only a `return` statement without any value specified. Therefore, the program will return `None` by default. However, since the instruction is to describe the output state based on the given information and not to state that it returns `None`, it is appropriate to say that the program does not return any value.
