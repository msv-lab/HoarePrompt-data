Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}. n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list containing the values `[n - k + 1, 1]`. `h` is 0.**

In natural language: The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and they still satisfy the conditions that they are positive integers, not equal to each other, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. The `costs` list remains unchanged with the values `[n - k + 1, 1]`. The variable `h` is now assigned the value 0.
