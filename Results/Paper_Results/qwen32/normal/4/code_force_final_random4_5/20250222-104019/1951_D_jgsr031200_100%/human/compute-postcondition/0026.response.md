Given the initial state:
- `n` is 0
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\)
- `costs` is \([n - k + 1, 1]\), which simplifies to \([-k + 1, 1]\)
- `h` is calculated as \(n // (n - k + 1) + (k - 1)\), which simplifies to \(0 // (-k + 1) + (k - 1) = 0 + (k - 1) = k - 1\)
- `h` is less than `k` (which is true since \(k - 1 < k\))

The Python code snippet provided is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `costs`, and `h`.

Thus, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **NO**
