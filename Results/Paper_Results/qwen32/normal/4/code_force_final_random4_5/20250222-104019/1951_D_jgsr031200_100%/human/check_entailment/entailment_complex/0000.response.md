Reasoning:  
The provided program is not correctly addressing the problem requirements. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Basic Cases**: The function correctly handles the case where `n == k` by printing "YES", followed by the number of stalls (1) and the price per jewel (1). It also correctly handles the case where `n < k` by printing "NO". However, the logic for other cases is flawed.

2. **General Case**: The function attempts to determine if it's possible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. However, the logic used for this is incorrect:
   - It initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]` and then calculates `curr` as `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`.
   - It then adds `curr` to `h` and subtracts `i * curr` from `n`.
   - The condition `if h < k` is checked to determine if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels, but the logic does not ensure that the total number of jewels bought exactly equals `k` and that the number of stalls does not exceed 60.

3. **Stall Limitation**: The problem specifies that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls. The current implementation does not ensure that the number of stalls is within this limit.

4. **Output Requirements**: If the answer is "YES", the program should print the number of stalls and the prices per jewel for each stall. The current implementation does not guarantee that these prices will lead to Alice buying exactly `k` jewels.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
