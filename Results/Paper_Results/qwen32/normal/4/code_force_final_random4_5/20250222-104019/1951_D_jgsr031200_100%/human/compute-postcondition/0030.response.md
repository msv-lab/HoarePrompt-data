Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `costs` is a list defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is calculated as `n // (n - k + 1) + (k - 1)`, and it is given that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Calculate `n - k + 1`**:
   - Given `n` is 0, the expression `n - k + 1` simplifies to `0 - k + 1 = 1 - k`.
   - Therefore, the first element of the `costs` list is `1 - k`.

2. **Define the `costs` list**:
   - The `costs` list is defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - Substituting the value of `n - k + 1`, we get `costs = [1 - k, 1]`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The code snippet is `print(*costs)`.
   - The `*` operator unpacks the list `costs` and prints each element separated by a space.
   - Therefore, the output will be the elements of the `costs` list printed in order.

### Final Output:
- The first element of `costs` is `1 - k`.
- The second element of `costs` is `1`.

Thus, the output of the `print(*costs)` statement will be:
Output: **1 - k 1**
