Output State: **`n` is `-n - curr`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `2 * n`, `curr` is `n`, `i` is `1`**.

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to `-n - curr` by subtracting `i * curr` from it, where `i` is `1` and `curr` is `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
