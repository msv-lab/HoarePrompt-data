Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}. n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list containing the values `[n - k + 1, 1]`.**

Natural language: The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as positive integers within the given constraints, with `n` being greater than or equal to `k` and not equal to `k`. A new list `costs` is created with the first element being `n - k + 1` and the second element being `1`.
