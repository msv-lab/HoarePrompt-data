The code snippet assigns the value of `x` to a set named `ans`. The values of `n` and `m` are not modified by this code. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `n` and `m` as they were initially returned by `func_3()`, and `x` is now part of the set `ans`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `ans` is a set containing `x`.**
