The code snippet assigns the values returned by the function `func_3()` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `x`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws, and `x` is an integer representing the starting player. After the execution of the code, the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` will be whatever values are returned by `func_3()`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.**
