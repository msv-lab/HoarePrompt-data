Postcondition: **`n` and `m-2` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`. `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `temp` is adjusted based on the value of `c` and the current `q`. `ans` is a set containing at least one element, where each element is a value `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n` for some `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`, plus the newly added element `(q + r) % n`. `q` is the next element in the iteration sequence of `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` includes the element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` also includes the element `(q - r) % n`.**
