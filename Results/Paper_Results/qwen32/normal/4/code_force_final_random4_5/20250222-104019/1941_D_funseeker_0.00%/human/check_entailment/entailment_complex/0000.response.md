### Reasoning:

The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_3()` reads the initial conditions for each test case (number of players `n`, number of throws `m`, and starting player `x`).
   - `func_1()` is used to read each line of input, which is then processed by `func_3()` or used directly in `func_4()`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - A set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, the distance `r` and direction `c` are read.
     - If the direction `c` is '0' (clockwise) or '?' (unknown), the new position `(q + r) % n` is added to a temporary set `temp`.
     - If the direction `c` is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?' (unknown), the new position `(q - r) % n` is added to `temp`.
   - After processing each throw, `ans` is updated to `temp`, which contains all possible positions after the throw.
   
3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If `0` is in `ans` after processing all throws, it is replaced with `n` because player positions are 1-based.
   
4. **Output:**
   - The number of unique players who could have the ball after `m` throws is printed.
   - The positions of these players are printed in increasing order.

### Code Correctness:

The code correctly handles all the described scenarios and edge cases. It processes each test case independently and accurately calculates the possible positions of the ball after all throws. The use of a set ensures that only unique positions are considered, and the handling of the modulo operation correctly wraps around the circular arrangement of players.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

**Correctness: True**
