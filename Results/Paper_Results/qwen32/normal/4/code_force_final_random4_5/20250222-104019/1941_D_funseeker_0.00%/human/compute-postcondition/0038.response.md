Postcondition: **`n` and `m-1` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`; `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the element `(q_next + r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set; `ans` is a set containing at least one element; `q` is `q_next`.**
