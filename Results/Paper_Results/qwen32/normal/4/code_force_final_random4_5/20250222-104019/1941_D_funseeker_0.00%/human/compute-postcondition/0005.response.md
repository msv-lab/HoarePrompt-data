The code snippet provided initializes a new set named `temp`, but it does not modify the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, or `c`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` must be greater than 0, `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing `x`, `r`, and `c`, where `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1().split()`, and `r` is now an integer; `temp` is an empty set.**
