The function `func_4` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `x`. `n` is an integer representing the number of players, with a constraint that `2 <= n <= 1000`. `m` is an integer representing the number of throws, with a constraint that `1 <= m <= 1000`. `x` is an integer representing the starting player, with a constraint that `1 <= x <= n`. 

The function returns the position of the player who ends up holding the item after `m` throws, starting from player `x`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (number of players), `m` (number of throws), and `x` (starting player). It returns the position of the player who ends up holding the item after `m` throws, starting from player `x`.**
