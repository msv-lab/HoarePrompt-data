Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code has a few issues that could lead to incorrect results:

1. **Handling of Modulo Operation:**
   - The code uses `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` to calculate the new positions. However, when `q - r` is negative, `(q - r) % n` will not give the correct counterclockwise position. Instead, it should be `(q - r) % n` or `(q - r + n) % n` to ensure the result is always a positive index within the range `[0, n-1]`.

2. **Handling of Position 0:**
   - The code checks for `0` in the `ans` set and replaces it with `n`. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The modulo operation should naturally handle the circular nature of the positions without needing to manually adjust for `0`.

Here is a corrected version of the problematic part of the code:
```python
def func_4():
    (n, m, x) = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        (r, c) = func_1().split()
        r = int(r)
        temp = set()
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r - 1) % n + 1)  # Adjusting for 1-based indexing
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r - 1) % n + 1)  # Adjusting for 1-based indexing
        ans = temp
    print(len(ans))
    print(*sorted(ans))  # Ensure the output is sorted
```

The corrected code ensures that the positions are correctly calculated using modulo operations and handles the circular nature of the players correctly. It also ensures that the output is sorted as required by the problem description.

Given these issues, the original code is not correct for all potential cases.
