The code snippet converts the variable `r` from a string to an integer. The other variables (`n`, `m-1`, `x`, `c`, `ans`, and `temp`) remain unchanged in terms of their types and values.

Output State: **`n` and `m-1` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`; `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`; `ans` is a set containing all values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the previous value of `c`; `temp` is a set containing all values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans` based on the previous value of `c`.**
