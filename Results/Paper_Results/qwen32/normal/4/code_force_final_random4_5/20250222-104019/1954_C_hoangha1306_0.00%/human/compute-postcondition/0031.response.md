The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Given the initial state and the code snippet, the variables `i`, `kq1`, and `kq2` have been updated, but the `continue` statement does not change their values further; it only affects the flow of the loop.

Since the `continue` statement does not alter the values of `i`, `kq1`, and `kq2` directly, the output state will reflect the changes made before the `continue` statement was encountered.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `i` is incremented by 1, `kq1` is `kq1 + a[i]`, `kq2` is `kq2 + a[i]`.**
