The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to `kq1`. Given that `kq1` was initially an empty string, after the execution of this line, `kq1` will contain the string representation of `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a new string provided by the user input with length at least 1; `b` is a new string provided by the user input; `kq1` is the string representation of `y`; `kq2` is an empty string; `vt` is not equal to 0; `q` is `q + 1`; the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are not equal; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**
