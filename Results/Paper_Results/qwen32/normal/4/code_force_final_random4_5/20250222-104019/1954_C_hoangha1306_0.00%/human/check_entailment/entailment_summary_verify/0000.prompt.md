You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two strings `x` and `y` of equal length, where each character is a digit from 1 to 9. For each test case, it constructs two new strings: one where each digit is the maximum of the corresponding digits from `x` and `y` (with the first differing digit being the larger of the two), and another where each digit is the minimum of the corresponding digits from `x` and `y` (with the first differing digit being the smaller of the two). It then prints these two strings for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The problem requires maximizing the product of two numbers, `x` and `y`, by swapping corresponding digits between them. The provided program iterates through each digit of `x` and `y`, and based on the value of the digits, it attempts to maximize the product by strategically swapping or keeping the digits.

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Digit Swapping Logic**: The program checks if the digits are different and then swaps them in a way that it hopes to maximize the product.
2. **Handling Equal Digits**: If the digits are the same, it simply appends them to the resulting strings.
3. **Alternating Swap Strategy**: The variable `vt` is used to alternate the swapping strategy between the two numbers.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **All Digits Same**: If all digits in `x` and `y` are the same, the program should return the same numbers.
2. **Digits in Descending/Ascending Order**: If one number has digits in descending order and the other in ascending, the program should swap them to make both numbers as large as possible.
3. **Mixed Digits**: If the digits are mixed, the program should swap them to maximize the product.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with some edge cases:
