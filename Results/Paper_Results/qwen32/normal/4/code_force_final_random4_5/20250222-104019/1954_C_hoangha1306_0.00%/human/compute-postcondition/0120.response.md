To determine what will be printed by the `print(kq2)` statement, we need to understand how the variable `kq2` is constructed based on the provided initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer between 1 and 1000. This represents the number of iterations or the length of the strings `a` and `b`.
2. **`a` and `b`**: Non-empty strings provided by the user input. These strings are presumably of length `t`.
3. **`kq1` and `kq2`**: These are strings constructed based on certain rules. However, the exact rules for constructing `kq1` and `kq2` are not explicitly provided in the initial state.
4. **`vt`**: A binary variable (0 or 1) that is set to 1 if any character at the same position in `a` and `b` differ (`a[i] != b[i]` for any `i`), otherwise it is 0.
5. **`q`**: A counter that is incremented by the number of iterations. This is not directly relevant to the value of `kq2`.

### Analysis:
Since the exact rules for constructing `kq1` and `kq2` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `kq2` based on the given information. However, we can describe what `kq2` might be in terms of the initial state.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If `kq2` is constructed based on the characters of `a` and `b`**: It could be a string that encodes the differences or similarities between `a` and `b`. For example, it could be a string of '1's and '0's where '1' indicates a mismatch and '0' indicates a match at each position.
2. **If `kq2` is constructed based on some other criteria**: The exact nature of `kq2` would depend on those criteria, which are not specified here.

### Conclusion:
Without the specific rules for constructing `kq2`, the most precise description we can provide is that `kq2` is a string constructed based on the relationship between the strings `a` and `b`, and possibly other variables like `vt` and `q`.

Therefore, the output can be described as:
Output: **kq2 (where kq2 is a string constructed based on the relationship between the strings a and b)**
