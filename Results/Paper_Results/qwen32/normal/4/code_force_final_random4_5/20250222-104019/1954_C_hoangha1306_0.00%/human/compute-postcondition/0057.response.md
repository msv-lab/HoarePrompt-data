Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are each concatenated with the character at the new index `i` of string `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer values at index `i` of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the integer values at index `i` of `a` and `b`. If `vt` was 0, `vt` is now 1. `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `x` and `kq2` with the string representation of `y` if `a[i] > b[i]`; otherwise, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` and `kq2` with the string representation of `x`. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` and `kq2` with the string representation of `x`.**
