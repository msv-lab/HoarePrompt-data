Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` and `b` are strings provided by user input with `a` having a length of at least 1; `q` and `i` are each incremented by 1. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are each concatenated with `a[i]`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. If `vt` was 0, it is now 1, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `x` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise with the string representation of `x`. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` is concatenated with `str(y)` and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)`.**
