The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to the current value of `kq1`. Given that `kq1` is initially an empty string, after the execution of the code, `kq1` will be equal to the string representation of `y`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `kq2`, `vt`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `kq1` is the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is not equal to 0, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and the character at position `i` in `a` is not equal to the character at position `i` in `b`.**
