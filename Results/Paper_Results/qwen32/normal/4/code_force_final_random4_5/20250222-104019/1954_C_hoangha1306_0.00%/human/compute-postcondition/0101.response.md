Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` and `b` are non-empty strings provided by the user input; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 1; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`. If `vt` is 0, then `vt` is set to 1, and if `a[i] > b[i]`, `kq1` is concatenated with `x` and `kq2` with `y`; otherwise, `kq1` is concatenated with `y` and `kq2` with `x`. If `vt` is not 0, then `kq1` is updated to `kq1` + str(y) and `kq2` is updated to `kq2` + str(x).**
