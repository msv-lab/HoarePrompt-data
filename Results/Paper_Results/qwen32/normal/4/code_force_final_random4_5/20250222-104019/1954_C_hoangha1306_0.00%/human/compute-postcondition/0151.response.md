The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. In this case, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `q`, `i`, `kq1`, and `kq2` remain unchanged as the `continue` statement does not modify these variables. The loop simply proceeds to its next iteration.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a string provided by user input with length at least 1; `b` is a string provided by user input; `q` is `q + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `kq1` is a string that has been updated to include the character `a[i]` appended to it; `kq2` is a string that has been updated to include the character `a[i]` appended to it.**
