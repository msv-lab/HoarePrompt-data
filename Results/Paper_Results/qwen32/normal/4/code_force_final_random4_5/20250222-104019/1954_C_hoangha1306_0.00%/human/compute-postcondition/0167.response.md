The code snippet assigns the minimum and maximum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` of strings `a` and `b` to variables `x` and `y`, respectively. 

Given the initial state, `t`, `a`, `b`, `q`, and `i` are already defined. After executing the code, `x` and `y` are newly assigned values based on the comparison of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a string provided by user input with length at least 1; `b` is a string provided by user input; `q` is `q + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**
