The code snippet `kq2 = kq2 + str(x)` appends the string representation of the variable `x` to the variable `kq2`. Given the initial state, `kq2` is initially an empty string, and `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. After the execution of the code, `kq2` will hold the string representation of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input; `b` is the new string provided by the user input; `kq1` is the string representation of the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `kq2` is the string representation of `x`; `vt` is not equal to 0; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 0; `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
