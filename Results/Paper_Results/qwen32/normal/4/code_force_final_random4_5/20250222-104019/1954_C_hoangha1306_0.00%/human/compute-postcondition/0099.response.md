The variable `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `y` to it. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `q`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input; `b` is a new string provided by the user input; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 1; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`; `kq1` is updated to `kq1` + str(y).**
