The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `vt`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `vt` is 1.**
