Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. `a` and `b` are strings provided by user input.
3. `kq1` is a string constructed based on the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] != b[i]` and `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`.
4. `kq2` is a string constructed based on the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] != b[i]` and `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`.
5. `vt` is 1 if there was at least one inequality between characters in `a` and `b`, otherwise 0.
6. `q` is `q + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(kq1)
```

### Explanation:
- `kq1` is constructed by comparing each character of strings `a` and `b` at the same index.
- For each index `i`:
  - If `a[i] != b[i]`, `kq1` takes the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
  - If `a[i] == b[i]`, `kq1` takes `a[i]` (which is the same as `b[i]`).

### Output:
The `print(kq1)` statement will output the string `kq1` which is constructed as described above. Since the exact strings `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact value of `kq1`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the constructed string `kq1`.

Output: **kq1 (where kq1 is the string constructed based on the maximum of a[i] and b[i] for each index i where a[i] != b[i] and a[i] if a[i] == b[i])**
