Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` and `b` are non-empty strings provided by the user input; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 2; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `vt` is 1; `kq1` is the initial value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `x` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise concatenated with the string representation of `y`; `kq2` is the initial value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `y` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise concatenated with the string representation of `x`.**
