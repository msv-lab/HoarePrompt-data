The code snippet appends the string representation of `y` to the variable `kq1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a string provided by user input with length at least 1; `b` is a string provided by user input; `q` is `q + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `vt` is 1; `kq1` is `kq1` + `str(y)`**.
