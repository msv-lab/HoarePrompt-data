The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to the existing value of `kq1`. The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `q`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input; `b` is a new string provided by the user input; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 1; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`; `vt` is 1; `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `y`.**
