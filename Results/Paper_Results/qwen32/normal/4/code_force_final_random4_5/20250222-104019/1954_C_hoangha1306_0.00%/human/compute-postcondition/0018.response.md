The code snippet concatenates the string representation of `y` to `kq2`. Since `kq2` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `kq2` will hold the string representation of `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `kq1` is the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is the string representation of `y`, `vt` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, the character at position `i` in `a` is not equal to the character at position `i` in `b`, and the character at position `i` in `a` is greater than the character at position `i` in `b`.**
