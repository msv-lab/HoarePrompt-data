Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a new string provided by the user input with length at least 1; `b` is a new string provided by the user input; `kq1` is the string representation of `y`; `kq2` is the string representation of `x`; `vt` is not equal to 0; `q` is `q + 1`; the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are not equal; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**

In natural language: The variable `kq2` now contains the string representation of `x`. All other variables retain their previous values.
