The code snippet concatenates the string representation of `y` to `kq1`. Since `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `kq1` will now include this value as a string. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input; `b` is the new string provided by the user input; `kq1` is the string representation of the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `kq2` is ''; `vt` is not equal to 0; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 0; `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
