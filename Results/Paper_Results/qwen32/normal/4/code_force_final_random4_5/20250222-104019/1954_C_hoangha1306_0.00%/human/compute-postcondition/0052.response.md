The value of `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `x` to it. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `y`, `vt`, and `kq1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values at index `i` of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values at index `i` of `a` and `b`, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is `kq1_initial + str(y)`, `kq2` is `kq2 + str(x)`**.
