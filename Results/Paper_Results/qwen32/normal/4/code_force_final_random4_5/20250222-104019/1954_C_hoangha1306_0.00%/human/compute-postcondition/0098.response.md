Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` and `b` are non-empty strings provided by the user input; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 1; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`; `vt` is 1; `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of either `x` or `y` depending on the condition; `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of the other value. Specifically, if `a[i] > b[i]`, `kq1` is concatenated with `x` and `kq2` with `y`; otherwise, `kq1` is concatenated with `y` and `kq2` with `x`.**
