### Reasoning:
The problem requires maximizing the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. The strategy to achieve this is to always pair the smallest numbers together. This is because, when you sort the list, the smallest numbers are at the beginning, and by pairing them, you ensure that the minimum of each pair is as large as possible given the constraint of always picking the smallest available numbers.

The provided program follows this optimal strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers.
4. It calculates the sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), which correspond to the smaller numbers in each pair when the list is sorted.
5. It prints this sum as the result for the current test case.

The execution summary confirms that the program sorts the list and sums the elements at even indices, which is the correct approach to solve the problem optimally.
