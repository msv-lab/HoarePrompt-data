### Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given 2n integers on a whiteboard.
   - We need to perform n moves where in each move, we pick two integers, add the smaller of the two to our score, and erase both integers.
   - The goal is to maximize the final score after n moves.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize the score, we should aim to maximize the sum of the smallest elements in each pair.
   - Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the smallest elements are paired together.
   - By summing every second element starting from the first (i.e., A[0], A[2], A[4], ...), we effectively sum the smaller elements of each pair (since the array is sorted).

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of 2n integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers.
   - It calculates the sum of every second element starting from the first (A[0], A[2], A[4], ...) and prints this sum.
   - The process is repeated for all test cases.

4. **Verification with Example:**
   - For the first test case (`n=1`, numbers `2 3`):
     - After sorting, the array is `2 3`.
     - Sum of every second element starting from the first is `2`.
   - For the second test case (`n=2`, numbers `1 1 2 1`):
     - After sorting, the array is `1 1 1 2`.
     - Sum of every second element starting from the first is `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - For the third test case (`n=3`, numbers `1 1 1 1 1 1`):
     - After sorting, the array is `1 1 1 1 1 1`.
     - Sum of every second element starting from the first is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by summing the smallest elements in each pair after sorting the array. Therefore, the program is correct.
