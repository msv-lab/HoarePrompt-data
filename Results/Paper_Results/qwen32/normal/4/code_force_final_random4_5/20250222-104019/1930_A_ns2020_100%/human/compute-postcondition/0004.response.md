The code sorts the list `A` in ascending order. The other variables, `t` and `n`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is an input integer; `A` is a sorted list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is an input integer; `A` is a sorted list of integers.**
