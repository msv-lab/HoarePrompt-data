To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given information and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, it is part of the initial state).
2. `n` is an input integer, which represents the number of elements in the list `A`.
3. `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```

### Explanation:
- `A[::2]` is a slicing operation on the list `A`. It selects every second element from the list `A` starting from the first element (index 0).
- `sum(A[::2])` calculates the sum of the elements selected by the slicing operation.

### Steps:
1. **Slicing the List `A`**:
   - If `A` is a sorted list of integers, and we take every second element starting from the first, we get a new list containing the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, etc.
   
2. **Summing the Sliced List**:
   - The `sum()` function then adds up all the elements in this new list.

### Example:
Let's consider an example to make this clearer:
- Suppose `A = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` (a sorted list of integers).
- `A[::2]` would be `[1, 5, 9]`.
- `sum(A[::2])` would be `1 + 5 + 9 = 15`.

### Output:
Since we don't have the exact list `A` provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the list `A`.

Output: **sum of elements at even indices in the sorted list A (where A is the sorted list of integers obtained from the input)**
