### Reasoning:
The problem requires maximizing the score by choosing pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. To achieve the maximum score, it is optimal to pair the smallest integers together because this ensures that the minimum value in each pair is as large as possible given the constraints.

The provided program correctly implements this strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers.
4. It then sums the elements at even indices of the sorted list (i.e., `A[0]`, `A[2]`, `A[4]`, ..., `A[2n-2]`), which correspond to the smaller values in each pair when the list is sorted.
5. It prints this sum as the score for that test case.

By sorting the list and summing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that it is always adding the smallest possible value from each pair to the score, thereby maximizing the score.
