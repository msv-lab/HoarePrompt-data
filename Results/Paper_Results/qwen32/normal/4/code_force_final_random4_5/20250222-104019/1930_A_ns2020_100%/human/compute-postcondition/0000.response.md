Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000. Each of the following `t` test cases consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and the second line contains 2`n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7 for each `i`.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The preconditions for the test cases remain unchanged as they are described in the initial state.
