To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the function call `ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)`. Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can only infer that `ret` is assigned the value returned by `func_1` when called with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments. The values of `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within `func_1`, which they are not, based on the given snippet.

Output State: **`introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` are non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals respectively; `ret` is the value returned by `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**.
