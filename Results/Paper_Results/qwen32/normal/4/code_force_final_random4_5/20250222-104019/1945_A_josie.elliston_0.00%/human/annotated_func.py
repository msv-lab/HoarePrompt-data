        #State: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers. The current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3. The sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is 3 or greater.
    #State: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers. If the current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3, the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is 3 or greater. If extroverts is divisible by 3, there are no additional constraints on universals.
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    #The program returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`. It returns `None` if `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is less than 3. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals respectively.
def func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals):
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
    #The program returns -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the sum of introverts and the result of another function `func_1` applied to extroverts and universals. If `func_1` returns `None`, the function returns -1; otherwise, it returns the calculated sum.
