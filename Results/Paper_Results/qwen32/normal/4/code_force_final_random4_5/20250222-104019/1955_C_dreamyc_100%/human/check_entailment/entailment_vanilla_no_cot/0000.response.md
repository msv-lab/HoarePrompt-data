Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine how many ships are sunk after the Kraken's attack. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not accurately simulate the alternating attacks on the first and last ships.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Attacks**: The program incorrectly calculates the number of attacks on the first and last ships by using `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2`. This does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks as described in the problem.

2. **Incorrect Accumulation Logic**: The program accumulates the durability of the ships from both ends and checks if the accumulated durability is less than or equal to the calculated number of attacks. This logic does not correctly account for the fact that ships are removed from the list once they sink.

3. **No Removal of Sunk Ships**: The program does not remove ships from the list once they sink. This means that it incorrectly counts ships that have already sunk as still being attacked.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the attacks by alternating between the first and last ships, reducing their durability until they sink, and then removing them from the list. This can be efficiently done using two pointers or a deque to represent the ships.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    ships = deque(nums)
    attacks = 0
    sunk = 0
    
    while k > 0 and ships:
        if attacks % 2 == 0:
            # Attack the first ship
            if ships[0] > 0:
                ships[0] -= 1
                if ships[0] == 0:
                    ships.popleft()
                    sunk += 1
        else:
            # Attack the last ship
            if ships[-1] > 0:
                ships[-1] -= 1
                if ships[-1] == 0:
                    ships.pop()
                    sunk += 1
        attacks += 1
        k -= 1
    
    return sunk

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version uses a `deque` to efficiently remove ships from both ends and correctly simulates the alternating attacks.
