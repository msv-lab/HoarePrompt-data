To determine the output state, let's analyze the given variables and the operations performed on them:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 · 10^5.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^15.
- `nums` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9.
- The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `k` is less than the sum of `nums`.
- `a` is calculated as `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
- `b` is calculated as `k // 2`.
- `s_a` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.
- `s_b` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.
- `ans` is the total number of times `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` and `s_b` is less than or equal to `b` during the iterations.

Given the initial state, `s_a` and `s_b` are both equal to the sum of all elements in `nums`. Since `k` is less than the sum of `nums`, `a` and `b` are both less than `s_a` and `s_b`. Therefore, the condition `s_a <= a` and `s_b <= b` will never be true, and `ans` will remain 0 throughout the iterations.

Output State: **The program returns 0**.
