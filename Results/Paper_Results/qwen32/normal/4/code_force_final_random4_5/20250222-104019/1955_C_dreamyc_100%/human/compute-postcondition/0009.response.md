The code snippet `s_b += nums[n - i - 1]` increments the value of `s_b` by the element at the index `n - i - 1` in the list `nums`. 

Given the initial state, `s_b` was 0. After the execution of the code, `s_b` will be the value of `nums[n - i - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 1; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; Additionally, `k` is less than the sum of `nums`; `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`; `b` is `k // 2`; `ans` is 0; `s_a` is `nums[i]`; `s_b` is `nums[n - i - 1]`**
