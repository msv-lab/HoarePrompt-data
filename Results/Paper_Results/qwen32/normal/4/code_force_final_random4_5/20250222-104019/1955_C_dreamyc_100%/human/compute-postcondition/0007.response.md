The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and `n` is used to define the range of the loop. Therefore, the state of the loop can be adjusted by ensuring that `n` is at least 1, as this is the only condition that affects whether the loop will execute. The initial value of `i` before the loop starts is not relevant because it is set by the `range` function in the loop head.

Given the provided state, the only thing that needs to be ensured is that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `s_a`, `s_b`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 1; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; Additionally, `k` is less than the sum of `nums`; `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`; `b` is `k // 2`; `ans` is 0; `s_a` is 0; `s_b` is 0**
