Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is `i + 1`. If `ar[i] == num`, then `same` is either 3, 4, or 2 depending on the values of `ar[i-1]` and `ar[i-2]`, with `minn` being either `inf` or 1 depending on the value of `same`. Otherwise, `num` is updated to `ar[i]`, `same` is set to 1, and `minn` is set to 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `same`, `minn`) remain unchanged unless `i` points to an index in `ar` where the value equals `num`, in which case `same` and `minn` may be updated according to the specified conditions.
