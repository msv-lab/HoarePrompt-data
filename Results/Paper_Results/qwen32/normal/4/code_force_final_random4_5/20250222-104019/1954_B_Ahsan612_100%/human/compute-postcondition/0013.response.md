The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` compares the current value of `minn` with `same` and assigns the smaller of the two to `minn`. Given that `minn` is initially `inf` (infinity) and `same` is `1`, the result of this operation will be `1` because `1` is smaller than `inf`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 2, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**
