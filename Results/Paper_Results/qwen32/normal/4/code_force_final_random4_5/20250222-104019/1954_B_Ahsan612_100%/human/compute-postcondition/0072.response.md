The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, `i` was either 3, 4, or 5. Therefore, after the increment, `i` will be 4, 5, or 6 respectively.

Here's the detailed breakdown:
- If `i` was 3, it will now be 4.
- If `i` was 4, it will now be 5.
- If `i` was 5, it will now be 6.

No other variables are affected by this operation. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `same`, and `minn` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 6 elements, `i` is either 4, 5, or 6, `num` is `ar[3]` if `i` was 3 otherwise `ar[4]`, `same` is 4 if `i` was 3 otherwise 2 or 1, `minn` is `inf` if `ar[i]` was equal to `num` and `i` was 3, `minn` is 2 if `i` was 3 and `ar[i]` was not equal to `num`, `minn` is 3 if `i` was 4 and `ar[i]` was not equal to `num`, `minn` is 1 if `i` was not 3 and `ar[i]` was not equal to `num`**.
