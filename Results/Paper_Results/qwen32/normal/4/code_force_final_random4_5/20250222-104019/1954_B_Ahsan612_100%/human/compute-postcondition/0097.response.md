In the given `while` loop, the loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `ar`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements
- `i` is either 2 or 3
- `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`
- `same` is 2 if `ar[i-1]` equals `num` (i.e., `ar[1]` equals `ar[0]` or `ar[2]` equals `ar[0]` if `i` was 2 and `ar[2]` equals `ar[1]` if `i` was 1), otherwise `same` is 1
- `minn` is `inf` if `same` is 2, otherwise `minn` is 1

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `i` is still less than the length of `ar`. Since `ar` has at least 2 elements, the maximum value of `i` that allows the loop to execute again is `len(ar) - 1`.

Given that `i` is either 2 or 3, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than `i`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Identify the variable in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `i < len(ar)`.
3. **Adjust the state**: Since `i` is either 2 or 3, `len(ar)` must be greater than 3 to ensure the loop can execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is either 2 or 3, `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`, `same` is 2 if `ar[i-1]` equals `num` (i.e., `ar[1]` equals `ar[0]` or `ar[2]` equals `ar[0]` if `i` was 2 and `ar[2]` equals `ar[1]` if `i` was 1), otherwise `same` is 1, and `minn` is `inf` if `same` is 2, otherwise `minn` is 1**.
