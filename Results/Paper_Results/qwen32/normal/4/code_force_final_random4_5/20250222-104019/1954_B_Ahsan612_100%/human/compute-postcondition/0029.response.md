The code `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given that `minn` is initially either 1 or the minimum of 1 and `ar[3]`, and `same` is either 1 or increased by 1, the new value of `minn` will be the smaller of these two values.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `i` is 5, `num` is `ar[5]`, `minn` is the minimum of its initial value and `same`, and `same` is either 1 or increased by 1.**

In simpler terms, `minn` is updated to be the smaller of its current value and `same`. Other variables remain unchanged.
