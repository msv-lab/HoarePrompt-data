The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `same`, `minn`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and will output the integer `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print(-1)` statement is a direct output of the integer `-1`.
2. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `same`, `minn`) are referenced in the `print` statement.
3. Therefore, the value of the output is solely determined by the `print(-1)` statement.

Output: **-1**
