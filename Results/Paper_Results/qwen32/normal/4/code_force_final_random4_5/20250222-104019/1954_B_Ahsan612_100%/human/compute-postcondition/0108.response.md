Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is `i + 2` (where `i` was either 3 or 4 at the end of the previous iteration), `num` is `ar[i]`, `same` is either 2, 3, or 1 depending on the values of `ar[i-1]` and `ar[i-2]`, `minn` is either `inf` or 1 depending on the value of `same`.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `num` is updated to be `ar[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
