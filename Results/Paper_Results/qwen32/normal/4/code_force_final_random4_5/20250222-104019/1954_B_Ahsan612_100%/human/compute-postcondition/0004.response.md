The variable `num` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `ar`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, and `same`) remain unchanged. Since `ar` is a list of integers, `num` will be the first integer in that list.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`.**
