The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, if `ar[i]` was equal to `num` (which is `ar[0]`), then `i` was 1, and it will now be 2. If `ar[i]` was not equal to `num`, then `i` was 2, and it will now be 3. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `same`, and `minn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 2 elements, if `ar[i]` was equal to `num` (which is `ar[0]`), then `i` is now 2, `same` is 2, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is now 3, `num` is `ar[2]`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 1.**
