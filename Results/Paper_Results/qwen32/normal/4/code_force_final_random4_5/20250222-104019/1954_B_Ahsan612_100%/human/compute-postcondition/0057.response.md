The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `ar`. If `i` is less than the length of `ar`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- If `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, then `i` is now 2.
- Otherwise, `i` is now 3.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`. Since `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 2 elements, the length of `ar` is at least 2. 

If `i` is 2, it can execute one more time if the length of `ar` is greater than 2.
If `i` is 3, it can execute one more time if the length of `ar` is greater than 3.

However, since we need to ensure the loop can certainly execute one more time, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where `i` is 3. Therefore, we need to adjust the length of `ar` to be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 4 elements, if `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, then `i` is now 2, `same` is 2, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is now 3, `num` is `ar[2]`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 1**.
