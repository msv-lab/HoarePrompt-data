To determine what will be printed by the `print(minn)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state:

1. `t` must be greater than 0, but `t` is not directly used in the `print(minn)` statement.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `ar` is a list of integers.
4. `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, but `i` is not directly used in the `print(minn)` statement.
5. `num` is the last unique number in `ar`.
6. `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical numbers in `ar`.
7. `minn` is the minimum of its current value and `same`. Additionally, `minn` is neither equal to `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.

Given these conditions, the value of `minn` depends on the count of the last sequence of identical numbers in the list `ar`. However, without the exact list `ar`, we cannot determine the exact value of `same` or `minn`. But we can describe `minn` in terms of these variables.

`minn` is the minimum of its current value and `same`. Since `minn` is not `inf` or the length of `ar`, it must be a value that is less than or equal to `same` and greater than 0 (since `t` must be greater than 0 and `minn` is derived from `same` which counts identical numbers).

Thus, the output will be the value of `minn`, which is the minimum of its current value and the count of the last sequence of identical numbers in the list `ar`.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum of its current value and the count of the last sequence of identical numbers in the list `ar`)**
