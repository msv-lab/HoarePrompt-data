The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given that `minn` is either `inf` or `1` and `same` is either `2`, `3`, or `1`, the new value of `minn` will be `1` if `same` is `1` or `2` or `3`, because `1` is the smallest possible value among `inf`, `1`, `2`, and `3`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is `i + 2` (where `i` was either 3 or 4 at the end of the previous iteration), `num` is `ar[i]`, `same` is either 2, 3, or 1 depending on the values of `ar[i-1]` and `ar[i-2]`, `minn` is `1`.**
