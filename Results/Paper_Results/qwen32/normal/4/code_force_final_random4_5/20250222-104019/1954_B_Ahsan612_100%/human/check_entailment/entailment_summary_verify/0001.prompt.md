You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the minimum length of a sequence of consecutive identical numbers in the list `a`. If such a sequence exists, it prints the length; otherwise, it prints -1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array so that it stops being beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1`), such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]`, and replacing `a[i]` with `a[i-1]`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads `t` (number of test cases).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array) and the array `ar` itself.

2. **Logic**:
   - The variable `same` is initialized to 1. This variable counts the length of the current sequence of identical elements.
   - The variable `num` is initialized to the first element of the array. It keeps track of the current sequence's element.
   - The variable `minn` is initialized to `inf` (infinity). This variable will store the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements found in the array.
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
     - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
     - If the current element is different from `num`, it:
       - Updates `minn` with the minimum value between `minn` and `same`.
       - Resets `same` to 1.
       - Updates `num` to the current element.
   - After the loop, it performs a final update of `minn` with the minimum value between `minn` and `same` to account for the last sequence.
   - If `minn` is still `inf` or if `minn` is equal to the length of the array (`len(ar)`), it means all elements in the array are the same, and it prints `-1` (impossible to make it non-beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which is the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Correctness:
The program correctly identifies the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements in the array. If this length is 1 or if all elements are the same, it correctly outputs `-1`. However, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed.

**Flaw in Logic**:
- The program only considers the minimum length of sequences of identical elements. However, the problem requires the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. This involves considering how removing elements can break the ability to make all elements the same through the described operation.
- The program does not account for the possibility of breaking the array into multiple sequences that cannot be reduced to a single value through the described operation.

### Conclusion:
The program is not correct because it does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only considers the minimum length of sequences of identical elements, which is not sufficient for solving the problem.

**Correctness: False**

### Correct Solution Approach:
A correct solution would involve a more complex analysis of the array structure and how removing elements can disrupt the ability to make all elements the same through the described operation. This might involve dynamic programming or a more intricate greedy approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove.

Correctness: **False**
