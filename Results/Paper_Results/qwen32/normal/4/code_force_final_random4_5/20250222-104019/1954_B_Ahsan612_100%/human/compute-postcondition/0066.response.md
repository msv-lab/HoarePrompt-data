The code snippet `same += 1` increments the value of the variable `same` by 1. Given the initial state, `same` could be either 1 or 3. Therefore, after the increment, `same` will be either 2 or 4.

All other variables remain unchanged. Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 6 elements. If `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, then `i` is 3, `same` is 4, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 4 if `ar[i]` was equal to `num` otherwise `i` is 5, `num` is `ar[3]` if `i` was 3 otherwise `ar[4]`, `same` is 2, and `minn` is 2 if `i` was 3 otherwise `minn` is 1**
