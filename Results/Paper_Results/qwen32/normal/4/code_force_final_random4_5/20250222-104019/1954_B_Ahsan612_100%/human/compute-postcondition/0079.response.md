Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers, `i` is the length of `ar`, `num` is the last unique element in a sequence, `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`. If `minn` is either `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`, then `minn` retains its value as `inf` or the length of `ar`. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`.**
