The code snippet assigns the value `inf` to the variable `minn`. This does not affect any of the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State remains the same for all other variables except `minn`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `minn` is `inf`.**
