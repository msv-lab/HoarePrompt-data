The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `i` was either 2 or 3. If `i` was 2, it becomes 3. If `i` was 3, it becomes 4. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, `same`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is either 3 or 4, `num` is either `ar[2]` or `ar[3]`, `minn` is either 1 or the minimum of 1 and `ar[3]`, and `same` is either 1 or increased by 1.**
