Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is either 3 or 4, `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`, `same` is 2 if `ar[i-1]` equals `num` (i.e., `ar[2]` equals `ar[0]` or `ar[3]` equals `ar[0]` if `i` was 3 and `ar[3]` equals `ar[2]` if `i` was 2), otherwise `same` is 1, and `minn` is `inf` if `same` is 2, otherwise `minn` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was 2, it becomes 3, and if `i` was 3, it becomes 4. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `same`, and `minn` remain unchanged.
