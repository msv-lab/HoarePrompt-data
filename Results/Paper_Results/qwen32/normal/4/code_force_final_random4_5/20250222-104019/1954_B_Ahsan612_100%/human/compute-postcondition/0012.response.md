The code snippet `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to the value of `ar[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` (which was initially `ar[0]`).

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is `inf`, `i` is 2, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

In natural language: The value of `num` is now updated to the value of the third element in the list `ar` (since `i` is 2). All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
