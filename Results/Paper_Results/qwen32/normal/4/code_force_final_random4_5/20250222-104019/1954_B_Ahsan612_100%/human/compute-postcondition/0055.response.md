Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 2 elements. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num` (which is `ar[0]`), then `i` remains 1, `same` is 2, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is updated to 2, `num` is updated to `ar[2]`, `same` remains 1, and `minn` is updated to 1.**
