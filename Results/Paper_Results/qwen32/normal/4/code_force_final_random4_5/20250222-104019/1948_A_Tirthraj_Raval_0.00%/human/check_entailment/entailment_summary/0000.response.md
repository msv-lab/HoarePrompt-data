Reasoning:
The program correctly follows the logic outlined in the problem statement. According to the problem, a special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This means that for a character to be special, it must be different from its adjacent characters on both sides, or it must be at the edge of the string and different from its single neighbor.

The program checks if `n` (the number of special characters) is odd. If `n` is odd, it is impossible to construct such a string because special characters need to come in pairs to satisfy the condition of being equal to exactly one neighbor. Thus, the program correctly prints 'NO' for odd `n`.

For even `n`, the program constructs a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters. This construction ensures that each 'A' is special (equal to exactly one of its neighbors, which is a 'B') and each 'B' is special (equal to exactly one of its neighbors, which is an 'A'). Therefore, the number of special characters is exactly `n`, and the string meets the problem's requirements. The program correctly prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string.

The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and the program adheres to the problem constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
