Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to build a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters.
- A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- If no such string exists, we should print "NO".
- If such a string exists, we should print "YES" and then the string itself.

### Provided Program Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
```

### Function Summary Recap:
- The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
- If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'.
- If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' followed by a string of length `n` consisting of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters.

### Original Assessment Recap:
- The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it handles the case when `n` is odd incorrectly.
- It provides examples like `n = 1` and `n = 3` where the program incorrectly prints "NO" but a valid string can be constructed.

### Analysis:
1. **Case when `n` is odd**:
    - The program correctly identifies that a string with an odd number of special characters cannot be constructed with the given pattern (alternating 'A' and 'B'). This is because in an alternating pattern, every character will either have two different neighbors (if it's not at the edge) or no neighbors (if it's at the edge), making it impossible to have an odd number of special characters.
    - For example, in the string "AABBA", the second 'A', the 'B', and the third 'A' are special characters, but this string does not follow the alternating pattern used by the program. The alternating pattern like "ABABAB..." will always result in an even number of special characters.
    - The original assessment is incorrect in stating that a valid string can always be constructed for odd `n` using the problem's definition of special characters.

2. **Case when `n` is even**:
    - The program constructs a string with an even number of special characters by using an alternating pattern of 'A' and 'B'.
    - For example, for `n = 6`, the string "ABABAB" will have 6 special characters (positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 if considering 1-based indexing).
    - This part of the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies that a string with an odd number of special characters cannot be constructed using the given constraints and correctly constructs a valid string for even `n`. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is inaccurate.

**Final: False**
