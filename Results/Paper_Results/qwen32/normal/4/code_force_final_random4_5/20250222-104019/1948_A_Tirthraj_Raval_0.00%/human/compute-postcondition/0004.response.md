The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 50.
   - `n` is an integer and is specified to be odd.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The code snippet contains the statement `print('NO')`.
   - This statement directly prints the string `'NO'` to the console.

3. **Output**:
   - Since the `print` statement directly specifies the string `'NO'`, this is exactly what will be printed, regardless of the values of `t` and `n`.

Output: **NO**
