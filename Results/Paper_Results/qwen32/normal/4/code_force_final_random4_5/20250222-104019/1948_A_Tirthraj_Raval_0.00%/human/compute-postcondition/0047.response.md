The code appends an element to the list `pattern` based on the expression `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]`. Given `i` is 2, we can calculate the index as follows:

1. `i % 2` evaluates to `2 % 2` which is `0`.
2. `0 ^ 1` evaluates to `1` (bitwise XOR operation).
3. Therefore, `'AB'[1]` evaluates to `'B'`.

So, the character `'B'` is appended to the list `pattern`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 0 to 48, `n` must be at least 5, `pattern` is a list containing four elements where the last element is 'B', `i` is 2**.
