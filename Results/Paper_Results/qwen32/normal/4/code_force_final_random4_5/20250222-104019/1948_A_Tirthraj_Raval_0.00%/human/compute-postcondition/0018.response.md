Let's break down the given initial state and the code to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 50. (Note: `t` is not directly used in the provided code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output of the print statement.)
- `n` is an even integer.
- `pattern` is a list of `n` elements alternating between 'A' and 'B'.
- `i` is `n // 2 - 1`. (Note: `i` is not directly used in the provided code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output of the print statement.)

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(pattern))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Pattern Construction**:
   - Since `pattern` is a list of `n` elements alternating between 'A' and 'B', and `n` is even, the list will have exactly `n/2` 'A's and `n/2` 'B's.
   - The sequence will start with 'A' and alternate, so for example, if `n` is 4, `pattern` will be `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']`.
   - If `n` is 6, `pattern` will be `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B']`.

2. **Joining the Pattern**:
   - The `join` method concatenates all elements of the `pattern` list into a single string.
   - For example, if `pattern` is `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']`, `''.join(pattern)` will result in the string `"ABAB"`.
   - If `pattern` is `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B']`, `''.join(pattern)` will result in the string `"ABABAB"`.

### Conclusion:
- The output will be a string consisting of `n/2` 'A's and `n/2` 'B's, alternating between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A'.

### Final Output:
Output: **A string of `n/2` 'A's and `n/2` 'B's alternating, starting with 'A' (where `n` is an even integer)**

To make it more precise and clear:
- If `n` is 4, the output will be `"ABAB"`.
- If `n` is 6, the output will be `"ABABAB"`.
- And so on...

So, the final answer is:
Output: **A string of `n/2` 'A's and `n/2` 'B's alternating, starting with 'A' (where `n` is an even integer)**
