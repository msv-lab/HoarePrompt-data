The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `pattern`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n`, which retain their initial conditions. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is the input integer within the range 1 to 50; `n` is an input integer, and `n` is even; `pattern` is an empty list.**
