The code snippet `ans += (n + i) // cnt` will update the value of `ans` by adding the integer division of `(n + i)` by `cnt` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is 4, `cnt` is 16, and `n` is not specified but can be any value. Since `i` and `cnt` have specific values, the expression `(n + 4) // 16` will be added to `ans`.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `root` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cnt` is 16, `ans` is updated by adding `(n + 4) // 16` to it.**
