Reasoning:

The provided code is intended to solve a problem involving counting ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying specific conditions. However, the implementation in the `func_1` function does not match the problem statement's requirements. The problem requires us to count pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). 

The given function `func_1` instead calculates a value `ans` based on a different formula (n plus the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for i from 2 to the integer part of the square root of n plus one). This formula does not align with the problem's requirements for counting valid pairs (a, b).

The function also incorrectly reads `k` instead of `m` as the second input value, which suggests a mismatch between the problem description and the code implementation.

Given these discrepancies, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
