Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Code:
```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n
    root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
    print(ans)
```

### Function Summary Recap:
The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, calculates a value `ans` which is initially `n`, and then iterates from 2 to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus one. For each iteration, it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`. Finally, it prints `ans`.

### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Variable Naming**:
   - The function `func_1` reads `n` and `k`, but the problem specifies `n` and `m`. This inconsistency needs to be addressed.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The logic in the code does not match the problem's requirements. The code calculates a value based on divisors and sums, but it does not check pairs \((a, b)\) to see if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Example Verification**:
   - The original assessment mentions that the program coincidentally gives the correct output for some test cases but does not explain why this happens. It also provides an example where the program's output is incorrect.

### Detailed Analysis:
Let's consider the logic of the program and compare it with the problem requirements:
- The program calculates `ans` as `n` initially.
- It then iterates from 2 to \(\sqrt{n} + 1\), adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.

This logic does not involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic implemented in the code does not match the problem's requirements, and the coincidence of correct outputs for some test cases does not validate the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the given conditions.
