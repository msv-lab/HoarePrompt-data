Reasoning:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the given code does not implement this logic. Instead, it calculates a value based on a different formula that involves the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for `i` ranging from 2 to the square root of `n` plus one. This formula does not correspond to the problem's requirements.

The execution summary describes what the code does, but it does not match the problem statement. Therefore, the code is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
