Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The given program appears to be implementing a different algorithm, possibly related to counting divisors or some other unrelated problem. It does not include any logic to check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

To solve the problem correctly, the program should iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition is satisfied. A more efficient approach might involve mathematical insights or optimizations, but the current implementation does not address the problem at all.
