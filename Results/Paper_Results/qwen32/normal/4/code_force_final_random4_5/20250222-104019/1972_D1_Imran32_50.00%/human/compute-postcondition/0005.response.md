To determine the new state after the code execution, we need to analyze the impact of the provided line on the variables:

- `ans` is initially `n`.
- `cnt` is `i * i`.
- The line `ans += (n + i) // cnt` modifies `ans` by adding the integer division of `(n + i)` by `cnt`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `root`) are not directly modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `k` is an integer, `ans` is `n + (n + i) // (i * i)`, `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, `cnt` is `i * i`.**

In natural language: `n` remains at least 4, `k` remains an integer, `ans` is updated to `n` plus the integer division of `(n + i)` by `(i * i)`, `root` remains `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and `cnt` remains `i * i`.
