Postcondition: **`l` is 2 if it was 1, or `l` is 3 if it was 2; `r` is `n - 3` if `l` was 1, otherwise `r` is `n - 4` if `l` was 2; `k` is greater than 0; `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`; `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`; `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`. If `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is incremented by 1.**

In summary, regardless of the condition, `l` and `r` are adjusted based on their initial values, `k` remains greater than 0, `mi` is recalculated as the minimum of the new `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and both `a[l]` and `a[r]` are decreased by `mi`. If `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is incremented by 1.
