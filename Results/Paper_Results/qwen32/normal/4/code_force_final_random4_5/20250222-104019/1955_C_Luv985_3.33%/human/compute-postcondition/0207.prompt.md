Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15. `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 for each i. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is the smallest index such that `a[l]` is non-zero or `r + 1` if all elements from `l` to `r` are zero; `r` is the largest index such that `a[r]` is non-zero or `l - 1` if all elements from `l` to `r` are zero; `k` is the remaining value after all possible operations; `a` has reduced values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` based on the operations; `ans` is the count of elements that were fully consumed plus 1 if `k >= a[l]`, otherwise `ans` remains the same. If `l` is equal to `r`, the value of `ans` is updated accordingly.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `l` is equal to or greater than `r`; `k` is 0 or less; `ans` is the total number of elements reduced to 0 plus 1 if `l == r` and `k >= a[l]` is True, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged; `a` has elements adjusted based on operations; `T` is truthy and decremented by 1; `n` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer, `k` is 0 or less, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k >= a[n - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers, `T` is 0. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is determined based on the comparison between `k` and `a[n - 1]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
