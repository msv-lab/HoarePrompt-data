The code snippet initializes a variable `ans` to 0. No other variables are modified.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 <= `T` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0.**
