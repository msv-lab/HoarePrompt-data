Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is 1, `T` is truthy and has been decremented by 1, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `t` is `k % 2`, and `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0.**

The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
