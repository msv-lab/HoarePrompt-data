Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and prints the maximum number of elements from the list that can be fully consumed given the value of `k`, where consuming an element means reducing its value to zero by subtracting from `k`. The function handles each test case independently and outputs the result for each.**
