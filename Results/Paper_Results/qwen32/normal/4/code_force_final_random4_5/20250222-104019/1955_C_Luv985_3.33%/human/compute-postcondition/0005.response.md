The code snippet `n = int(n)` converts the string `n` to an integer. This affects the variable `n` by changing its type from a string to an integer. All other variables (`T`, `k`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 <= `T` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is a string representing an integer such that 1 <= int(`k`) <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 for each i. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
