The code snippet `a[r] -= mi` modifies the value of `a[r]` by subtracting `mi` from it. Given the initial state, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. After the operation, `a[r]` will have its value decreased by `mi`.

Output State: **`l` is 1 if it was 0, or `l` is 2 if it was 1; `r` is `n - 2` if `l` is 1, otherwise `r` is `n - 3` if `l` is 2; `k` is greater than `mi * 2`; `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`; `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`; `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`.**

In simple terms, the output state is: `l` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `mi` remains unchanged, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, and `a[r]` is also reduced by `mi`.
