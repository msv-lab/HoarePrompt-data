Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer such that 0 <= `T` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is an integer such that 0 <= `T` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `l` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[0]` was 0; `r` is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on whether `a[r]` was 0; `ans` is 1 if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0 in the else part, or 2 if both `a[0]` and `a[r]` were 0 in the if part, or 1 if only `a[0]` was 0 in the if part, otherwise `ans` is 0; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`, and `mi` is recalculated. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is `k % 2` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is an integer such that 0 <= `T` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` retains its value or is reduced by 2 * `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`; `a` is a list of `n` integers, where `a[0]` and `a[r]` may be reduced by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`; `l` is either 0 or 1 if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `l` remains 0; `r` is either `n-2` or `n-3` if `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `r` remains `n-1` or `n-2`; `ans` is incremented by 1 if either `a[0]` or `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, or set based on `mi - t - k // 2` if `mi * 2 > k`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[r]` before or after the operation depending on the condition.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `T` is an integer such that 0 <= `T` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are each decreased by `mi`, `r` is set to `n-2` if `a[r]` was 0 and `ans` is incremented by 1, `l` is set to 1 if `a[l]` was 0, or 2 if `a[l]` was 1 and `a[l]` was 0, and `mi` is recalculated as the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the operation. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, or if either `a[0]` or `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, or set based on `mi - t - k // 2` if `mi * 2 > k`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
