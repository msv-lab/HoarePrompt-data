Output State: **`l` is 2 if it was 1, or `l` is 3 if it was 2; `r` is `n - 2` if `l` is 1, otherwise `r` is `n - 3` if `l` is 2; `k` is greater than 0; `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`; `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`; `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`; `ans` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. If `l` was initially 1, it is now 2. If `l` was initially 2, it is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged with their respective conditions and values.
