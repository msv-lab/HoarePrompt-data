You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and prints the maximum number of elements from the list that can be fully consumed given the value of `k`, where consuming an element means reducing its value to zero by subtracting from `k`. The function handles each test case independently and outputs the result for each.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` ships with given durability.
- The Kraken attacks the ships `k` times, alternating between the first and last ship.
- Each attack reduces the durability of the targeted ship by 1.
- A ship sinks when its durability drops to 0.
- We need to determine how many ships have sunk after `k` attacks.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Logic:**
   - `l` and `r` are initialized to point to the first and last ship, respectively.
   - `ans` is initialized to count the number of sunk ships.
   - The main loop continues as long as there are more than one ship (`l < r`) and there are remaining attacks (`k > 0`).
   - Inside the loop:
     - It calculates the minimum durability between the first and last ships (`mi`).
     - If `mi * 2` (the number of attacks required to sink both ships) is less than or equal to `k`, it reduces the durability of both ships by `mi`, subtracts `mi * 2` from `k`, and increments `ans` for each ship that sinks.
     - If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, it handles the remaining attacks:
       - It calculates the number of full attacks (`k // 2`) and the remainder (`k % 2`).
       - It checks if the remaining attacks can sink one of the ships and updates `ans` accordingly.
   - After the loop, if there's only one ship left (`l == r`), it checks if the remaining attacks can sink it.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of sunk ships for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Handling Remaining Attacks:**
  - The logic for handling the remaining attacks when `mi * 2 > k` is incorrect.
  - The condition `if mi - t - k // 2 == 0` is not correctly handling the scenario where the remaining attacks can sink one of the ships.
  - The `break` statement exits the loop prematurely, which may not be correct in all cases.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle the case where `n = 1` correctly.
  - The program does not handle the case where `k` is very large compared to the total durability of the ships.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly handle all edge cases and scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
