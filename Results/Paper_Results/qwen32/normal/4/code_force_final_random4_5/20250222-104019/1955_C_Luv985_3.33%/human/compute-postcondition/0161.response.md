Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, `T` is 0, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, and `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`. If `a[r]` (which is `a[n - 1]`) is 0, then `r` is updated to `n - 2`, `l` is 1, and `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `r` remains `n - 1`, `l` remains 0, and `ans` remains 0.**
