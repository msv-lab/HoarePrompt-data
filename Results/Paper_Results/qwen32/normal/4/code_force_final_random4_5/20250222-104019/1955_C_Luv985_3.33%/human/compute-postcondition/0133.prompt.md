Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `k` is the remaining value after all possible operations, now as an integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is 0; `T` is truthy and has been decremented by 1; `n` is the first part of the input as an integer.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 2` if `a[r]` was 0, otherwise `r` remains `n - 1`, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` are decreased by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is 2 if `a[l]` was 0 and `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is 1 if `a[l]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is 1 if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0 and `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, `T` is truthy and has been decremented by 1, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, and `k` is decreased by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`. If `a[l]` was 0, then `a[l]` is 0. The current value of `a[r]` is 0 if `a[r]` was 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, `t` is `k % 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `l` is 1 if it was 0, or `l` is 2 if it was 1. `r` is `n - 2` if `l` was 0, otherwise `r` is `n - 3` if `l` was 1, if `mi * 2 <= k`. Otherwise, `l` remains 0 or 1, and `r` remains `n - 1` if `l` is 0, or `r` remains `n - 2` if `l` is 1. `k` is greater than 0 and decreased by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`. `a` is a list of integers where `a[l]` is reduced by `mi` and `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` are decreased by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, and `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`. `ans` is 4 if `a[l]` was 0 and `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is 3 if `a[l]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is 3 if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0 and `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise `ans` is 2 if `a[r] == 0` if `mi * 2 <= k`. If `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` is 3 if `a[l]` was 0 and `a[r]` was 0 and `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, `ans` is 2 if `a[l]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is 2 if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0 and `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise `ans` is 1. If `a[l]` was 0, then `a[l]` is 0. The current value of `a[r]` is 0 if `a[r]` was 0. `T` is truthy and has been decremented by 1. `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`. If `mi * 2 > k`, `t` is `k % 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `l` is 2 if it was 1, or `l` is 3 if it was 2; `r` is `n - 3` if `l` was 1, otherwise `r` is `n - 4` if `l` was 2; `k` is greater than 0; `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi` and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[r]` was 0. Otherwise, `l` remains 1 if it was 0, or `l` remains 2 if it was 1; `r` remains `n - 2` if `l` is 1, otherwise `r` remains `n - 3` if `l` is 2; `k` is greater than `mi * 2`; `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`; `t` is `k % 2`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
