Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 <= `T` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `l` is 0 or 1 if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `l` remains 0; `r` is `n-1`; `ans` is incremented by 1 if either `a[0]` or `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, or set based on `mi - t - k // 2` if `mi * 2 > k`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `t` is `k % 2`; `ans` is now `ans + 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
