Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that 0 <= `T` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10^15 and `k` is now `k - mi * 2`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`; `l` is 1 if `a[0]` was 0, otherwise `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 1 if `a[0]` was 0, otherwise `ans` is 0; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. The current value of `a[l]` is unchanged.**
