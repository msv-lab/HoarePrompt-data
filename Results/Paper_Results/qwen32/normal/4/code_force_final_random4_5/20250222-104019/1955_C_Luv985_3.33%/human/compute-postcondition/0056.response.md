Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that 0 <= `T` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is a positive integer minus `mi * 2`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is now `a[l] - mi` and `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`; `r` is `n-1`; `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` was 0; `l` is 1 if it was 0, or 2 if it was 1, provided `a[l]` was 0; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the operation.**
