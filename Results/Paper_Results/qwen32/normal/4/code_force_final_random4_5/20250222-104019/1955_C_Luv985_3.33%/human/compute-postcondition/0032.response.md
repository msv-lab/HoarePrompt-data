Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that 0 <= `T` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `l` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[0]` was 0; `r` is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on whether `a[r]` was 0; `ans` is 1 if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0 in the else part, or 2 if both `a[0]` and `a[r]` were 0 in the if part, or 1 if only `a[0]` was 0 in the if part, otherwise `ans` is 0; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`, and `mi` is recalculated. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is `k % 2` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
