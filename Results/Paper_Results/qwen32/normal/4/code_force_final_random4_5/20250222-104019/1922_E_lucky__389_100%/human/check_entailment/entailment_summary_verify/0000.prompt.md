You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Program:
import math

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if x == 2:
        print(1)
        print(0)
        return
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `X` and performs calculations to determine a sequence of integers related to the powers of 2 that sum up to `X`. It then prints the length of this sequence followed by the sequence itself. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
Upon analyzing the provided program, it seems to be attempting to construct an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences. The program uses a greedy approach by decomposing X into a sum of powers of 2 and then constructing the array based on these powers. However, there are several issues with the approach:

1. **Incorrect Construction of the Array**: The program constructs the array based on the indices of the powers of 2 but does not correctly ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches X. Specifically, the way the array is constructed does not guarantee that the exact number of increasing subsequences will be X.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where X is not a sum of distinct powers of 2 correctly. For example, if X is 3, the program should output an array that has exactly 3 increasing subsequences, but the current approach does not ensure this.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints the array elements on the same line separated by spaces, which is correct per the problem statement, but the logic to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences is flawed.

To illustrate a specific case where the program does not work correctly, consider the input X = 3. The correct output should be an array that has exactly 3 increasing subsequences. One such array is `[0, 1, 0]` which has the subsequences `[0]`, `[1]`, and `[0, 1]`. However, the provided program does not generate this output for X = 3.

Let's test the program with X = 3:
- The program will decompose 3 into powers of 2: `3 = 2^1 + 2^0`.
- The array constructed will be `[0, 1]` (since `mx = 1` and `subseq_lens = [1, 0]`).
- The number of increasing subsequences in `[0, 1]` is 4 (`[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and the empty subsequence), which does not match the required 3 subsequences.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one input case, and the correctness is False.
