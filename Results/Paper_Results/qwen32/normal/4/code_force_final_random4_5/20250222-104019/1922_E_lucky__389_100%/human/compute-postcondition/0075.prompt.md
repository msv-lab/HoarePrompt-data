You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains a single integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}) representing the number of increasing subsequences required for that test case.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program returns nothing (None)
    #State: The input consists of a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, where `t` is equal to `x`. Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}) representing the number of increasing subsequences required for that test case. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0. Additionally, `x` is not equal to 2.
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: x is 0, subseq_lens contains the sequence of exponents (decremented by 1) of the powers of 2 subtracted from x in each iteration, and mx is the maximum value of these exponents (decremented by 1).
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the sequence of exponents (decremented by 1) of the powers of 2 subtracted from `x` in each iteration, `mx` is the maximum value of these exponents (decremented by 1), `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx - 1` followed by all elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 0
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: 0 1 1 4
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of an integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}) representing the number of increasing subsequences required. The function does not return any value (returns `None`).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing (None)


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
