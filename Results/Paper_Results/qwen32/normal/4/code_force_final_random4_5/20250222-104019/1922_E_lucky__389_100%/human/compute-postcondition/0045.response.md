The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after the increment, `i` becomes 2. Other variables (`t`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is equal to `x`, `x` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `subseq_lens` contains the value 1, and `mx` is at least 1.**
