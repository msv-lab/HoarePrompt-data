The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 4, so after the operation, `i` becomes 5. The values of the other variables (`t`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and the input values `X`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input consists of a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, where `t` is equal to `x`. Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}) representing the number of increasing subsequences required for that test case. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0. `i` is 5. Additionally, `x` must be at least 16.**
