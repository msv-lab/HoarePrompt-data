The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the initial value of `i` which is 2, becomes 3. The other variables `t`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is equal to `x`, `x` must be at least 4, `i` is 3, `subseq_lens` contains the value 1, and `mx` is at least 1.**
