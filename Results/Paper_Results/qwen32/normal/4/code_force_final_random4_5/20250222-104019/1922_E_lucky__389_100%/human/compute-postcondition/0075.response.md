Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `X` and performs calculations to determine a sequence of integers related to the powers of 2 that sum up to `X`. It then prints the length of this sequence followed by the sequence itself. The function does not return any value.**
