The code modifies the value of `ans2` based on the formula `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input; `ans1` is `a * n`; `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans2` is now calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, while `t`, `n`, `a`, and `ans1` retain their initial values.
