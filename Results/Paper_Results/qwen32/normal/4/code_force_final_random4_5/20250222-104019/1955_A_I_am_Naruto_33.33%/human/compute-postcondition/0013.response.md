To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1` (Note: The value of `t` is not used in the given print statement, so it is not relevant for this output.)
- `n` is an integer provided by the input.
- `a` is an integer provided by the input.
- `b` is an integer provided by the input.
- `ans1` is calculated as `a * n`.
- `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(min(ans1, ans2))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Calculate `ans1`:**
   - `ans1` is simply the product of `a` and `n`.
   - So, `ans1 = a * n`.

2. **Calculate `ans2`:**
   - `ans2` is calculated using the formula `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.
   - `b * n // 2` computes the integer division of `b * n` by 2.
   - `a * n % 2` computes the remainder when `a * n` is divided by 2.

3. **Determine the Minimum:**
   - The `min(ans1, ans2)` function will return the smaller of the two values `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the smaller value between `ans1` and `ans2`.

Output: **min(a * n, b * n // 2 + a * n % 2) (where a, b, and n are integers provided by the input)**
