Output State: **`t` is 0, and for each of the initial `t` test cases, the output is either `a` (if `n` is 1) or the minimum of `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` (if `n` is greater than 1).**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop counter `t` will be reduced to 0, meaning all test cases have been processed. For each test case, the output will be determined based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` as described in the loop: if `n` is 1, the output is `a`; otherwise, it is the smaller of `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.
