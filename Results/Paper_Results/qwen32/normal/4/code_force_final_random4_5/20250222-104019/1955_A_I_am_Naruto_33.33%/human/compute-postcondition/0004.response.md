The code calculates `ans2` based on the given formula. `ans1` remains unchanged as it is already defined as `a * n`. The new value of `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input; `ans1` is equal to `a * n`; `ans2` is equal to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.**
