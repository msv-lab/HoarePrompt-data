Let's analyze the provided program for the given problem description:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts given the price `a` for one yogurt and the price `b` for two yogurts under promotion. The program is supposed to handle multiple test cases.

Here's the given program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n  # Cost if buying all yogurts at the regular price
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2  # Cost if buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the remaining one at the regular price
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)  # If n is 1, just buy one yogurt at the regular price
```

Let's break down the logic:
1. **For `n > 1`**:
   - `ans1` calculates the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
   - `ans2` calculates the cost if as many pairs of yogurts as possible are bought at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt (if any) is bought at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

2. **For `n == 1`**:
   - The program directly prints `a` because there's only one yogurt to buy.

### Analysis of Correctness:
- The program handles the case where `n == 1` correctly by printing `a` since buying one yogurt at the regular price is the only option.
- For `n > 1`, the program calculates the cost in two ways:
  - `ans1` is straightforward and correct.
  - `ans2` calculates the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and the remaining `n % 2` yogurts at the regular price. This is also correct.
- The program then correctly prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Example Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided example cases:
1. **Input**: `2 5 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - `ans2 = 9 * 2 // 2 + 5 * 2 % 2 = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

2. **Input**: `3 5 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 9 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
   - Output: `14` (Correct)

3. **Input**: `3 5 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
   - Output: `15` (Correct)

4. **Input**: `4 5 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `ans2 = 11 * 4 // 2 + 5 * 4 % 2 = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
   - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given examples and the logic appears to be correct for all potential cases. There are no obvious edge cases that the program fails to handle.

**Correctness: True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for all possible values of `n`, `a`, and `b` within the given constraints. It handles both the case where `n == 1` and `n > 1` appropriately.
