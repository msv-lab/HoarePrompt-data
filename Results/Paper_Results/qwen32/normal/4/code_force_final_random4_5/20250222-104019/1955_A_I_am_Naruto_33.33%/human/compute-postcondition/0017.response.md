The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state mentions that `t` is `t - 2`, but since `t` is not used or modified in the provided code snippet, it remains unchanged.

The initial state also describes the conditions for `ans1` and `ans2` based on the value of `n`, but since these variables are not modified or used in the provided code snippet, their values are not affected by the code execution.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input. `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged from their initial state.**

In simple terms, the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values provided by the input, while `t`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remain as they were initially described.
