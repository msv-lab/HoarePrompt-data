The code snippet assigns the value of `a * n` to the variable `ans1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged except for the introduction of `ans1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input; `ans1` is equal to `a * n`.**
