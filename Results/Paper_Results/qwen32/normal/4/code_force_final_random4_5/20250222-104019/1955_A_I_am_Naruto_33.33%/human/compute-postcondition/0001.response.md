The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` as integers. The initial state does not provide specific values for `n`, `a`, and `b`, only that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. Since the input operation is not specified, we can assume that the input will be provided in the format "n a b".

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input.**
