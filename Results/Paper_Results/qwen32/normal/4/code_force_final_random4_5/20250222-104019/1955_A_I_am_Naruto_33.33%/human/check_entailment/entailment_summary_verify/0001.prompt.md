You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints the minimum cost, where the cost is either `a * n` or `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, depending on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it simply prints `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, given the price of one yogurt `a` and the price of two yogurts `b` under a promotion.

### Key Points:
1. **Single Yogurt Purchase**: If `n` is 1, the cost is simply `a`.
2. **Multiple Yogurts Purchase**:
   - If `n` is greater than 1, we need to consider two scenarios:
     - **Scenario 1 (Regular Price)**: Buying all yogurts at the regular price, which would cost `a * n`.
     - **Scenario 2 (Promotion Price)**: Buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and any remaining single yogurt at the regular price. The cost for this scenario is `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
     - The final result should be the minimum of these two scenarios.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program correctly implements the above logic.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are read.

2. **Calculation**:
   - If `n` is 1, it simply prints `a`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates the cost for both scenarios (`ans1` and `ans2`) and prints the minimum of these two values.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case (2 yogurts, a=5, b=9)**:
   - Regular price: 2 * 5 = 10
   - Promotion price: 9 (1 pair)
   - Minimum: 9

2. **Second Test Case (3 yogurts, a=5, b=9)**:
   - Regular price: 3 * 5 = 15
   - Promotion price: 9 + 5 = 14 (1 pair + 1 single)
   - Minimum: 14

3. **Third Test Case (3 yogurts, a=5, b=11)**:
   - Regular price: 3 * 5 = 15
   - Promotion price: 11 + 5 = 16 (1 pair + 1 single)
   - Minimum: 15

4. **Fourth Test Case (4 yogurts, a=5, b=11)**:
   - Regular price: 4 * 5 = 20
   - Promotion price: 11 * 2 = 22 (2 pairs)
   - Minimum: 20

The program produces the correct output for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
