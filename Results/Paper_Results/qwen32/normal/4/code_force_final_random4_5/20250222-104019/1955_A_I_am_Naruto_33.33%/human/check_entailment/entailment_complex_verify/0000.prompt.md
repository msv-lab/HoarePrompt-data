You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, and for each of the initial `t` test cases, the output is either `a` (if `n` is 1) or the minimum of `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` (if `n` is greater than 1).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints the minimum cost, where the cost is either `a * n` or `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, depending on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it simply prints `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program for the given problem description:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts given the price `a` for one yogurt and the price `b` for two yogurts under promotion. The program is supposed to handle multiple test cases.

Here's the given program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n  # Cost if buying all yogurts at the regular price
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2  # Cost if buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the remaining one at the regular price
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)  # If n is 1, just buy one yogurt at the regular price
```

Let's break down the logic:
1. **For `n > 1`**:
   - `ans1` calculates the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
   - `ans2` calculates the cost if as many pairs of yogurts as possible are bought at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt (if any) is bought at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

2. **For `n == 1`**:
   - The program directly prints `a` because there's only one yogurt to buy.

### Analysis of Correctness:
- The program handles the case where `n == 1` correctly by printing `a` since buying one yogurt at the regular price is the only option.
- For `n > 1`, the program calculates the cost in two ways:
  - `ans1` is straightforward and correct.
  - `ans2` calculates the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and the remaining `n % 2` yogurts at the regular price. This is also correct.
- The program then correctly prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Example Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided example cases:
1. **Input**: `2 5 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - `ans2 = 9 * 2 // 2 + 5 * 2 % 2 = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

2. **Input**: `3 5 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 9 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
   - Output: `14` (Correct)

3. **Input**: `3 5 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
   - Output: `15` (Correct)

4. **Input**: `4 5 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `ans2 = 11 * 4 // 2 + 5 * 4 % 2 = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
   - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given examples and the logic appears to be correct for all potential cases. There are no obvious edge cases that the program fails to handle.

**Correctness: True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for all possible values of `n`, `a`, and `b` within the given constraints. It handles both the case where `n == 1` and `n > 1` appropriately.
