Postcondition: **`ans` is calculated based on the value of `y` relative to `pairs` (`gap // 2`). If `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`, then `ans` is `x - 2 + 2 * gap` if `y - pairs` is greater than or equal to `pairs`; otherwise, `ans` is `x - 2 + gap + 2 * (y - pairs)`. If `y` is less than `pairs`, then `ans` is `x - 2 + 4 * y` if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`; otherwise, `ans` is `x - 2 + gap + 2 * y`. If `y` was initially greater than or equal to `pairs`, `y` is updated to `y - (gap // 2)`. If `y` was less than `pairs`, `ans` is adjusted by adding `2 * y` to it. `gaps` remains a sorted list of all positive gaps with at least one more element, `pairs` is `gap // 2`, and `gap` is the next element in the `gaps` list.**
