Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2`, `gaps` is a list containing `[gap, gap]` if `gap` is greater than 0, or `[gap, gap]` if `gap` was less than or equal to 0 and then `gap` was appended, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 2`, `next_elem` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`, `gap` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0) - a[i] - 1`**

Explanation: The `gaps` list now includes the newly calculated `gap` value appended to it. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
