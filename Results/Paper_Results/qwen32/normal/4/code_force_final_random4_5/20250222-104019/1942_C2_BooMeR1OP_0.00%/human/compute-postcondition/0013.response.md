The code snippet calculates the value of `t1` based on the value of `a[i]`, `n`, and `i`. Given that `i` is `x`, we need to determine the value of `t1` as `(a[x] + 1) % n`.

Since `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, `a[x]` is the `(x+1)`-th smallest integer in the list `a`. The value of `t1` is then calculated as `(a[x] + 1) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, `present` is a set containing the same elements as `a`, `i` is x, `t1` is `(a[x] + 1) % n`.**
