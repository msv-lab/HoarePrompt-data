Postcondition: **`ans` is `x - 2`, `gaps` is a list containing `[gap]` if `gap` is less than or equal to 0, and `[gap, gap]` if `gap` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `next_elem` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`, `gap` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0) - a[i] - 1`.**
