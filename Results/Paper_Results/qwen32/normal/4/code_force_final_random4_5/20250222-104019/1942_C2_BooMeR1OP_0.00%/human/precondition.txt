t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n, x, and y are integers where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
