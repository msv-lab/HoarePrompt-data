The code snippet `ans += gap` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the value of `gap` to it. The initial state specifies that `ans` is `x - 2`, and `gap` is a positive value. Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be `(x - 2) + gap`.

The values of `gaps`, `pairs`, and `y` remain unchanged based on the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2 + gap`, `gaps` is a sorted list of all positive gaps, `pairs` is `gap // 2`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`.**
