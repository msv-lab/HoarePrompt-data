Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. It calculates and prints a value `ans` for each test case, which represents a computed result based on the given inputs. The function does not modify the input values but uses them to determine the final output.**
