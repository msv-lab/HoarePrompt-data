Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2`, `gaps` is a list containing `[gap]` if `gap` is greater than 0, otherwise `gaps` remains an empty list, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `next_elem` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`**

Explanation: The value of `next_elem` is calculated based on the expression `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`. The values of `ans`, `gaps`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.
