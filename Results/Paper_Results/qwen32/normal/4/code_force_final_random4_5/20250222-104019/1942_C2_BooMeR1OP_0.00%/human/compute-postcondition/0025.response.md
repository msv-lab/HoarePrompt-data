The code snippet assigns a value to `next_elem` based on the elements of list `a` and the values of `i`, `x`, and `n`. Specifically, `next_elem` is calculated as `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`. This means that `next_elem` is the element of `a` at the index `(i + 1) % x`, with an additional `n` added if `i` is equal to `x - 1`.

The values of `ans`, `gaps`, and `x` are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same for these variables.

Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2`, `gaps` is an empty list, `x` must be greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`**.
