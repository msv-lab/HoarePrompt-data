The value of `pair_idx` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is the largest index `i` in the range 1 to n-1 for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<', or 0 if `func_1` never returns '<'; `pair_idx` is 0, `i` is 0, `ans1` is '=', `ans2` is '>'**.
