The code assigns the value of `i` to `max_item_idx`. Given that `i` is 2, `max_item_idx` will now be 2. The other variables (`n`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is 2, `i` is 2, and `ans` is the return value of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`**.
