In the provided for loop:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will iterate over the range starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. The variables `i` and `n` are the only ones that can be adjusted according to the loop head.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4
- `max_item_idx` is 0

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `n` is greater than 1 because the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. Since `n` is already given to be in the range 2 to 10^4, it satisfies this condition. The variable `max_item_idx` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is 0, `i` is 1**
