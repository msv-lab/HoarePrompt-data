To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, let's analyze the loop's behavior:

The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1` (inclusive). In each iteration, it compares the current `max_item_idx` with the current index `i` using the function `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`. If the result of `func_1` is '<', it updates `max_item_idx` to the current index `i`.

The value of `max_item_idx` at the end of the loop will be the largest index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<'. If `func_1` never returns '<', `max_item_idx` will remain 0.

Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we can't determine the exact value of `max_item_idx` without it. However, based on the pattern observed from the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that `max_item_idx` will be the last index `i` for which `func_1` returned '<'.

Given the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, the final value of `max_item_idx` will be the largest `i` in this range for which `func_1` returns '<'. If `func_1` never returns '<', `max_item_idx` will remain 0.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is the largest index `i` in the range 1 to n-1 for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<', or 0 if `func_1` never returns '<`.**

In simpler terms, `max_item_idx` will be the last index where `func_1` indicated a change, or 0 if no such change was indicated throughout the loop.
