The function accepts an integer `n` within the range of 2 to 10,000. It determines two indices, `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`, based on the results of the function `func_1` called with different parameters. It prints these indices in the format `! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx]`. The indices are determined by specific comparison results returned by `func_1`.
