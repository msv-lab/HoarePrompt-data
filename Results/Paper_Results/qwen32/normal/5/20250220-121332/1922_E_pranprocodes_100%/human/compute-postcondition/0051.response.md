The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `x` is the input integer and `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [-100000000], `i` is incremented by 1, and `x` is not divisible by 2.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is the input integer and `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [-100000000], `i` is incremented by 1, and `x` is not divisible by 2.**
