The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 2, `x` must not be 0, `max` is 99999998 if `x` (new value) is even, otherwise `max` is 99999999 or 100000000 based on the new value of `x`'s parity. `min` is -99999998 if `x` (new value) is odd, otherwise `min` is -99999999 or -100000000 based on the new value of `x`'s parity. `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, `min`] if `x` (new value) is even, [100000000, -100000000, `min`] if the input integer was even and `x` (new value) is odd, [-100000000, 100000000, `min`] if the input integer was odd and `x` (new value) is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999, `min`]. `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` must not be 0, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 99999999 or 100000000 based on the new value of `x`'s parity; `min` is -99999998 if `x` is odd, otherwise `min` is -99999999 or -100000000 based on the new value of `x`'s parity; `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, `min`] if `x` is even, [100000000, -100000000, `min`] if the input integer was even and `x` is odd, [-100000000, 100000000, `min`] if the input integer was odd and `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999, `min`]; `i` is `i + 1`.**
