The code snippet appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. Given that `max` is 100000000, the list `ans` will now contain this value. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is the input integer and `x` must not be equal to 1, `x` is even, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000], `i` is incremented by 1**
