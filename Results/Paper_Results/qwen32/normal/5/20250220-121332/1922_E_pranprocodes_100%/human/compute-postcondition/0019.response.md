The value of `max` is decremented by 1. Given the initial state, if `x` is even, `max` was initially 99999999, so it becomes 99999998. If `x` is odd, `max` was initially -99999999, so it becomes -100000000. The values of `t`, `x`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is an input integer and must not be equal to 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, `max` is -100000000 if `x` is odd, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, `min` is 99999999 if `x` is even, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999] if `x` is even or [-100000000, -99999999] if `x` is odd.**
