### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the function summary in the context of the problem description to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Construct an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences.
- **Constraints**: The array length should be at most 200. If no such array exists, output -1. If multiple arrays exist, any valid array is acceptable.
- **Increasing Subsequences**: Subsequences must be strictly increasing and can be obtained by removing some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the integer `X` for each test case.

2. **Array Construction Logic**:
   - The program initializes `max` and `min` to large positive and negative values.
   - It uses a loop to reduce `X` to 1 by repeatedly dividing by 2 if `X` is even or subtracting 1 if `X` is odd.
   - Based on the operation, it appends either `max` or `min` to the `ans` list and adjusts `max` or `min` accordingly.
   - Finally, it reverses the `ans` list and prints its length and elements.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary accurately describes the logic of the program, which is to repeatedly divide `X` by 2 or subtract 1 from `X` and append corresponding values to the array.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Construction of Increasing Subsequences**:
   - The logic of appending `max` and `min` values does not ensure that the resulting array will have exactly X increasing subsequences.
   - The program does not guarantee that the constructed array will have the required number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where `X = 1`. For `X = 1`, the only valid array is an empty array, but the program does not handle this case correctly.
   - The program does not ensure that the constructed array has the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by `X`.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the length and elements of the array, but the logic for constructing the array is flawed, and it does not correctly handle the construction for all values of `X`.

#### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for constructing the array does not ensure that the array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, and it does not handle all edge cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
