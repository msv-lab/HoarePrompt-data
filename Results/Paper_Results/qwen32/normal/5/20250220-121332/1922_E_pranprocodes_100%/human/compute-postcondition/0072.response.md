Postcondition: **`t` is 2, `x` must not be 1 or 0, `max` is 99999997 if `x` is even after division, otherwise `max` is 99999998 or 99999999 based on the new parity of `x`; `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd after division, otherwise `min` is -100000000 or -99999998 based on the new parity of `x`; `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, `max`] if `x` is even after division, [100000000, -100000000, `max`] if the input integer was even and `x` is odd after division, [-100000000, 100000000, `max`] if the input integer was odd and `x` is even after division, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999, `max`]; `i` is incremented by 1. If `x` was odd, `max` is 99999998 or 99999999 based on the parity of `x` before division, `min` is -99999998 or -100000000 based on the parity of `x` before division, and `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, `min`], [100000000, -100000000, `min`], [-100000000, 100000000, `min`], or [-100000000, -99999999, `min`] based on the parities before and after division.**
