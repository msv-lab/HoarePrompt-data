The `ans` list is reversed, meaning the order of its elements is flipped. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is the number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 minus the number of times `x` was even, `min` is -100000000 plus the number of times `x` was odd, `ans` is a reversed list of `max` and `min` values based on the parity of `x` in each iteration, `i` is 1.**
