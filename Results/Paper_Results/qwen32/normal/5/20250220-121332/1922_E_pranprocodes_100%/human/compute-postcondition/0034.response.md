The value of `t` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `t` was 2, so now `t` is 3. The other variables (`x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged based on the conditions provided. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 3; if the original `x` was even, `x` is now the result of the current `x` divided by 2, `max` is 99999997, `min` is 99999999, and `ans` is `[100000000, 99999999, 99999998]`. If the original `x` was odd, `x` is now the result of the current `x` decremented by 1 twice, `max` is -100000001, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is `[-100000000, -99999999, -100000000]`.**
