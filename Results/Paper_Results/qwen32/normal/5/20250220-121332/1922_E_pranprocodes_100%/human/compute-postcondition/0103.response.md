Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is either `x // 2` if `x` was even or `x - 1` if `x` was odd (and `x` must not be 1), `max` is 99999998 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was even, 99999999 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was odd, 100000000 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or 100000000 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was even, -99999999 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was odd, -99999999 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or -99999998 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, `ans` is [100000000, 100000000] if `x` was even, [100000000, -100000000] if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or [-100000000, -99999999] if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, and `i` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the variable `t` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables (`x`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
