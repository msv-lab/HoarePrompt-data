To determine the final output state after the loop has completed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop continues until `x` becomes 1. In each iteration, if `x` is even, it appends the current `max` value to `ans`, decrements `max`, and divides `x` by 2. If `x` is odd, it appends the current `min` value to `ans`, increments `min`, and decrements `x` by 1. The loop counter `t` is incremented in each iteration.

The loop terminates when `x` becomes 1, and the final output state will include the final values of `t`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`.

Let's break down the final state:

1. **`x`**: The loop continues until `x` becomes 1.
2. **`t`**: This is the number of iterations the loop has executed, which is equal to the number of steps it took to reduce `x` to 1.
3. **`max`**: This starts at 100000000 and decreases each time an even `x` is encountered.
4. **`min`**: This starts at -100000000 and increases each time an odd `x` is encountered.
5. **`ans`**: This list accumulates `max` or `min` values based on whether `x` was even or odd in each iteration.

The exact values of `max` and `min` depend on the sequence of even and odd values of `x` during the iterations. However, we can determine the final state in terms of `x` being 1 and the number of iterations `t`.

Let's assume the input integer `x` is `n`. The number of iterations `t` required to reduce `n` to 1 is the number of steps in the process of repeatedly dividing by 2 (if even) or subtracting 1 (if odd). This is equivalent to the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` minus 1 (since each division by 2 reduces the number of bits by 1).

The final state will be:

- `x` is 1.
- `t` is the number of iterations it took to reduce `x` to 1.
- `max` is 100000000 minus the number of times an even `x` was encountered.
- `min` is -100000000 plus the number of times an odd `x` was encountered.
- `ans` is a list of `max` and `min` values accumulated during the iterations.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the loop, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`t` is the number of steps to reduce `x` to 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 minus the number of even `x` values encountered, `min` is -100000000 plus the number of odd `x` values encountered, `ans` is a list of `max` and `min` values accumulated during the iterations.**

In simpler terms, the final state is:

Output State: **`t` is the number of iterations, `x` is 1, `max` and `min` are adjusted based on the sequence of even and odd values of `x`, and `ans` contains the accumulated `max` and `min` values.**
