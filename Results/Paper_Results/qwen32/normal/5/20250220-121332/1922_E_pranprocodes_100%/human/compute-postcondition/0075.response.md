The code snippet provided is `ans.reverse()`, which reverses the order of elements in the list `ans`. The other variables `t`, `x`, `max`, and `min` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is the number of iterations, `x` is 1, `max` and `min` are adjusted based on the sequence of even and odd values of `x`, `ans` contains the accumulated `max` and `min` values in reversed order.**
