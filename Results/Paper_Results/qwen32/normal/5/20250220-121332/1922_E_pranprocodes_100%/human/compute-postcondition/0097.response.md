The value of `max` is decremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, if `x` was even, `max` was initially 99999999, and if `x` was odd, `max` was initially 100000000. After the decrement, `max` becomes 99999998 if `x` was even, and 99999999 if `x` was odd. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` must not be 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` was even and 99999999 if `x` was odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even and -99999999 if `x` was odd, `ans` is [100000000, 100000000] if `x` was even and [-100000000, 100000000] if `x` was odd, `i` is 1**
