Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is `x - 1` (where `x` must not be 1), `max` is 99999999 if `x - 1` was even and 100000000 if `x - 1` was odd, `min` is -99999999 if `x - 1` was even and -99999998 if `x - 1` was odd, `ans` is [100000000, -100000000] if `x - 1` was even and [-100000000, -99999999] if `x - 1` was odd, `i` is 1**

In simpler terms, the value of `x` is decremented by 1. The values of `max`, `min`, and `ans` are recalculated based on whether the new value of `x` is even or odd. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
