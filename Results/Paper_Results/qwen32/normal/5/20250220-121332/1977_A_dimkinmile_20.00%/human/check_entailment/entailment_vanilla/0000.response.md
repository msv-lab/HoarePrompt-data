Reasoning:
Let's break down the problem and the provided program to see if it meets the requirements.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube at a time. This means that after `n` moves, the number of cubes `m` in the tower can be any integer between `0` and `n` inclusive, depending on whether Nikita adds or removes cubes.

However, the provided program only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. This logic is flawed because it doesn't account for the possibility of removing cubes. Specifically:

- If `m` is greater than `n`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves because the maximum number of cubes you can have is `n` (if you add a cube in every move).
- If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, it is possible to have `m` cubes if Nikita adds cubes `m` times and removes cubes `n - m` times (if `m < n`), or if `m == n` and Nikita adds a cube in every move.

The correct condition should be whether `m` is within the range `[0, n]`.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
