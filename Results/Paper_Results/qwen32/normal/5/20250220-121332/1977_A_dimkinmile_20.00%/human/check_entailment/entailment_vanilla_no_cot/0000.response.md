Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The current implementation only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is not sufficient to determine the possibility of having exactly `m` cubes.

For example, in the second test case (`n=2`, `m=4`), the program outputs "No" because `n` is less than `m`. However, it is not possible to have exactly 4 cubes after 2 moves regardless of the sequence of moves (you can only have 0, 1, or 2 cubes).

The correct approach would be to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and thus the parity (evenness or oddness) of the number of cubes after `n` moves must match the parity of `m`. If `n - m` is even and `n >= m`, then it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Otherwise, it is not possible.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```
