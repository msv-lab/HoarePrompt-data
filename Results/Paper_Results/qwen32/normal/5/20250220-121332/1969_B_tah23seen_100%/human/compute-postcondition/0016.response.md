The code snippet `one += 1` increments the variable `one` by 1. The values of `s` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a binary string with length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `i`, `one` is incremented by 1.**
