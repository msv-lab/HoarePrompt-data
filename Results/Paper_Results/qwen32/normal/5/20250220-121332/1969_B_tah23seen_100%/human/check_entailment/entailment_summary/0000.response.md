Reasoning:

The provided solution attempts to calculate the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The logic in the function `func_1` is based on counting the number of '1's encountered and adding the cost whenever a '0' is found after a sequence of '1's. The cost for each such sequence is calculated as the length of the sequence of '1's plus one.

Let's break down the logic:
- The variable `one` keeps track of the number of consecutive '1's encountered.
- When a '0' is encountered after a sequence of '1's, the cost is incremented by the number of '1's seen so far (`one`) plus one.
- This approach assumes that each time a '0' follows a sequence of '1's, the cost to move those '1's to the right of the '0' is the length of the sequence plus one.

This logic seems to be based on a specific strategy for moving '1's to the right of '0's, but it does not necessarily guarantee the minimum cost for all possible strings. The provided solution does not consider the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to achieve the sorted order, and it does not explore all possible substrings for shifting.

For example, consider the string "101011". The provided solution calculates the cost as 5, but the optimal solution involves a different sequence of operations that results in a cost of 5, which is correct, but the method to arrive at this cost is not justified by the given explanation.

However, the provided solution seems to be correct for the given examples and the problem constraints. It calculates the cost based on the described strategy, and the execution summary aligns with this strategy.

Given that the problem constraints and examples seem to be satisfied by the provided solution, we can assume that the solution is correct for the intended problem.

Correctness: **True**
