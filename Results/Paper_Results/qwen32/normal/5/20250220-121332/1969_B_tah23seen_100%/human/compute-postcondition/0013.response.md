Postcondition: **`s` is a binary string with length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the previous `i`, `one` is set to 1 if a '1' has been encountered previously. If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, `cost` is increased by `one + 1`. Otherwise, `cost` is adjusted based on the previous `i` and `one` remains unchanged.**
