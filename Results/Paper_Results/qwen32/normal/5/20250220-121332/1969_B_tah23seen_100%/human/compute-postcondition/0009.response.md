Postcondition: **`s` is a binary string with length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5. If the current character `i` in the string `s` is '1', `cost` remains 0 and `one` is set to 1. If the current character `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, `cost` is set to `one + 1`, otherwise `cost` remains 0. `one` is greater than 0 if a '1' has been encountered previously.**
