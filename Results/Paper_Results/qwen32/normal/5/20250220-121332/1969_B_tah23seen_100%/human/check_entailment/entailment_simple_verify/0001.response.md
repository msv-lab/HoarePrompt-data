### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a detailed analysis of the problem and the solution, verifying the correctness of the function `func_1` with several examples. Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the annotated version of the code.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (all '0's before all '1's) using the minimum number of cyclic shifts on any substring, with the cost of each shift being the length of the substring.

#### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution uses a function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cost` is initialized to 0, representing the total cost.
   - `one` is initialized to 0, representing the count of consecutive '1's encountered so far.

2. **Iterate through the string**:
   - For each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is '1', increment the `one` counter.
     - If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0 (indicating there are '1's before this '0'), add `one + 1` to the `cost`. The `+1` accounts for the cost of the substring that includes the current '0' and all the '1's before it.

3. **Return the cost**:
   - After processing all characters in the string, the function returns the `cost`.

#### Correctness Verification:
The original assessment verifies the function with several examples, and the annotated version provides insights into the state of the program at key points. Let's re-evaluate using the annotated code:

- **Example 1**: `s = "10"`
  - Initially, `one = 0`, `cost = 0`.
  - First character is '1', so `one = 1`.
  - Second character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 1 + 1 = 2`.
  - Final `cost = 2`, which matches the expected output.

- **Example 2**: `s = "0000"`
  - The string is already sorted, so no operations are needed, and `cost = 0`.

- **Example 3**: `s = "11000"`
  - Initially, `one = 0`, `cost = 0`.
  - First two characters are '1's, so `one = 2`.
  - Third character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 2 + 1 = 3`.
  - Fourth character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 2 + 1 = 6`.
  - Fifth character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 2 + 1 = 9`.
  - Final `cost = 9`, which matches the expected output.

- **Example 4**: `s = "101011"`
  - Initially, `one = 0`, `cost = 0`.
  - First character is '1', so `one = 1`.
  - Second character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 1 + 1 = 2`.
  - Third character is '1', so `one = 2`.
  - Fourth character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 2 + 1 = 5`.
  - Fifth character is '1', so `one = 3`.
  - Sixth character is '1', so `one = 4`.
  - Final `cost = 5`, which matches the expected output.

- **Example 5**: `s = "01101001"`
  - Initially, `one = 0`, `cost = 0`.
  - Second character is '1', so `one = 1`.
  - Third character is '1', so `one = 2`.
  - Fourth character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 2 + 1 = 3`.
  - Fifth character is '1', so `one = 3`.
  - Sixth character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 3 + 1 = 7`.
  - Seventh character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 3 + 1 = 11`.
  - Final `cost = 11`, which matches the expected output.

#### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the specified cyclic shifts. The annotations and examples provided in the original assessment align with the expected behavior of the function.
