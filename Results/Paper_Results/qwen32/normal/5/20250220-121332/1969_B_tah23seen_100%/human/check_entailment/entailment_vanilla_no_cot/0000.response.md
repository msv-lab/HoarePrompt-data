To determine if the provided program is correct based on the given problem description, we need to carefully analyze the logic and correctness of the function `func_1`.

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the chosen substring.

Let's break down the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `cost` is initialized to 0. This will store the total cost.
   - `one` is initialized to 0. This will count the number of '1's encountered so far.

2. **Loop through the string**:
   - If the current character is '1', increment the `one` counter.
   - If the current character is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, this means that we have encountered a '0' after one or more '1's. In this case, the cost is incremented by `one + 1`. This is because to bring all the '1's before this '0' to the left of this '0', we need to perform cyclic shifts on substrings that include these '1's and the '0'. The cost of such operations is calculated as `one + 1`.

### Correctness Verification:
The function `func_1` calculates the cost based on the number of '1's encountered before each '0'. This logic is correct because:
- Each time a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's, it means that all the '1's before this '0' need to be moved to the left of this '0'. 
- The cost of moving these '1's to the left is the number of '1's plus the '0' itself, which is `one + 1`.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the function with one of the examples provided:

**Example 3:**
- Input: `11000`
- Expected Output: `9`

**Execution:**
- `s = "11000"`
- `one = 0`, `cost = 0`
- `i = '1'`: `one = 1`
- `i = '1'`: `one = 2`
- `i = '0'`: `one = 2`, `cost = 2 + 1 = 3`
- `i = '0'`: `one = 2`, `cost = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6`
- `i = '0'`: `one = 2`, `cost = 6 + 2 + 1 = 9`

The function correctly calculates the cost as `9`.

### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
