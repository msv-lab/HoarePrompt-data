To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to observe the pattern in the given output states and extend it to the completion of the loop.

Given:
- The loop runs for `len(pres)` iterations.
- In each iteration `i`, the values `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` and `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` are appended to `ptsb` and `ptss` respectively.
- `rem` is calculated as `k - (i + 1)`.

From the provided output states:
- After 1 iteration, `ptsb` and `ptss` each have one element.
- After 2 iterations, `ptsb` and `ptss` each have two elements.
- After 3 iterations, `ptsb` and `ptss` each have three elements.

Following this pattern, after all `len(pres)` iterations, both `ptsb` and `ptss` will each have `len(pres)` elements. Each element in `ptsb` will be computed as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` and each element in `ptss` will be computed as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **`ptsb` is a list with `len(pres)` elements `[preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1], ..., preb[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * b[len(pres) - 1]]`, and `ptss` is a list with `len(pres)` elements `[pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1], ..., pres[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * s[len(pres) - 1]]`.**

In simpler terms, `ptsb` and `ptss` will each contain `len(pres)` elements, where each element is calculated using the respective formulas involving `preb`, `pres`, `b`, `s`, and `k`.
