The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bodya'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`n`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb`), but these variables are not directly used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string provided within it.

Here is the step-by-step explanation:

1. The `print('Bodya')` statement is executed.
2. The string `'Bodya'` is passed to the `print` function.
3. The `print` function outputs the string `'Bodya'`.

Since there are no variables or dynamic values being used in the `print` statement, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the initial state of any variables.

Output: **Bodya**
