Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. The current values of `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are equal to `maxa`.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
