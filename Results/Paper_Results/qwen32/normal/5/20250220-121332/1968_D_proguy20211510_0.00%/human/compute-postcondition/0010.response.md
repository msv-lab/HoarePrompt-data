Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
2. `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps` are integers.
3. `pb` and `ps` are indices that point to specific elements in the list `a`.
4. `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
5. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
6. `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
7. The current values of `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are equal to `maxa`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('Draw')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('Draw')` does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, or `maxa`. It is a static string that will be printed regardless of the values of these variables.

### Output:
The code will print the string 'Draw'.

Output: **Draw**
