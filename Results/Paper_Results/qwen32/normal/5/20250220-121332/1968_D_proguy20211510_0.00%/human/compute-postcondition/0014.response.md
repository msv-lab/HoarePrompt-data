The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bodya'`. This string is a literal and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `'Bodya'` remains constant regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, or any other variables mentioned in the precondition.

Output: **Bodya**
