Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If both `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are equal to `maxa`, then no changes are made to the values of `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]`. Otherwise, if `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, it remains `maxa`; if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, no changes are made to `a[pb - 1]`. Similarly, if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, it remains `maxa`; if `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, no changes are made to `a[ps - 1]`. `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is True, `foundb` is True.**
