Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `maxs` is undefined, and `maxb` is undefined; `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `foundb` is `True`, and `founds` is a boolean (either `True` or `False`); `b` is a list containing one element `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`, and `s` remains a list containing zero or one element depending on the value of `founds`.**
