The code snippet initializes two new empty lists, `ptsb` and `ptss`. The values of `n`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, and `ss` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s`, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list.**
