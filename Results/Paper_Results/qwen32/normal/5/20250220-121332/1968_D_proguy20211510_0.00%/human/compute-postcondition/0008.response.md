The code snippet `maxa = max(a)` calculates the maximum value in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `maxa`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state where `a` is a list of integers, the maximum value in this list is now stored in `maxa`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**
