The given code snippet is `ss += s[i]`. This means the value of `s[i]` is added to the current value of `ss`.

Given the initial state, `ss` is `2 * s[i]`. After executing the code, `ss` will be `2 * s[i] + s[i]`, which simplifies to `3 * s[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State will be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is a list with three elements `[sb + b[i], sb + b[i] + b[i+1], sb + b[i]]`, `pres` is a list containing three elements `[ss + s[i], ss + s[i], 3 * s[i]]`, `sb` is `sb + 2 * b[i]`, `ss` is `3 * s[i]`, `ptsb` and `ptss` are empty lists, `maxs` is undefined, `maxb` is undefined, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution, `s` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `i + 1`.**
