The code snippet `s.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the element `a[ps - 1]` to the list `s`. This operation affects the list `s` by adding a new element to it. The values of other variables remain unchanged unless `a[ps - 1]` triggers any of the conditions that update other variables as per the initial state description. However, based on the provided code snippet alone, no other variables are directly modified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` and `pres` are empty lists, `sb` and `ss` are 0, `ptsb` and `ptss` are empty lists, `maxs` and `maxb` are undefined, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `s` now includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
