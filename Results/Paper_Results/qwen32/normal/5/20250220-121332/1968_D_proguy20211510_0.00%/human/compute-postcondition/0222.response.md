The code snippet `sb += b[i]` increments the variable `sb` by the value of `b[i]`. Given the initial state, `sb` is initially 0, and after the operation, `sb` will be equal to `b[i]`.

The other variables (`n`, `preb`, `pres`, `ss`, and `s`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `preb` is [previous elements of `preb`, `sb + b[i]`], `pres` is [], `sb` is `b[i]`, `ss` is 0, `s` must be a list with at least one element**.
