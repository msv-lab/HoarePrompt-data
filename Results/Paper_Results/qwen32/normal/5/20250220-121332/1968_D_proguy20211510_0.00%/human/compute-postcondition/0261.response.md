The code snippet provided reads four values from the input and splits them into four variables: `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. These variables are now assigned the string values from the input, and their previous values (if any) are overwritten.

Output State: **`n` is a string, `k` is a string, `pb` is a string, `ps` is a string; `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s`, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list with `len(pres)` elements calculated as `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `ptss` is a list with `len(pres)` elements calculated as `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is greater than `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`.**

In simpler terms, the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` now hold the string values obtained from the input, while all other variables remain unchanged.
