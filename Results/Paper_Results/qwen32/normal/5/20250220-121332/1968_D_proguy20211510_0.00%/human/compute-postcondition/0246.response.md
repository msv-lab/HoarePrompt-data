The code snippet provided recalculates the value of `rem` based on the current value of `i` and `k`. Given that `i` is 1, the new value of `rem` will be `k - (1 + 1)`, which simplifies to `k - 2`.

The other variables (`n`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` that must have at least 2 elements, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list with an additional element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` is a list with an additional element `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, `rem` is `k - 2`, `i` is 1**.
