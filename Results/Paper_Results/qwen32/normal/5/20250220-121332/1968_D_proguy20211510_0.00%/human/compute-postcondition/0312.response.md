The code snippet `b.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the element at index `pb - 1` of the list `a` to the list `b`. 

Given the initial state, `b` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]` if `foundb` is `False`. Since `foundb` is `True`, `b` currently has some elements already (either `a[pb - 1]` alone, or `a[pb - 1]` and `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`).

After executing the code, `b` will have an additional element `a[pb - 1]` appended to it. Therefore, if `foundb` was `True` and `founds` was also `True`, `b` will now contain three elements: `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`, `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`, and `maxa`, followed by `a[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` was `True` and `founds` was `False`, `b` will now contain two elements: `a[pb - 1]` and `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`, followed by `a[pb - 1]`.

However, the problem statement specifies that `b` is a list containing three elements `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`, `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`, and `maxa` if `foundb` and `founds` are both `True`. If `foundb` is `True` and `founds` is `False`, `b` is a list containing two elements `a[pb - 1]` and `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`.

Given the initial state and the code, `b` will have an additional `a[pb - 1]` appended to it, but the problem statement does not allow for more than three elements in `b` if `foundb` and `founds` are both `True`. Therefore, the additional `a[pb - 1]` will not change the list `b` in this specific context.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `maxs` is undefined, and `maxb` is undefined; `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. If `founds` is `True`, then `s` is a list containing one or two elements, with the last element being `maxa`. If `founds` is `False`, then `s` is a list containing the element `a[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both `True`, then `s` has an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` at the end and `b` is a list containing three elements `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`, `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`, and `maxa`. If `foundb` is `True` and `founds` is `False`, then `s` has an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` at the end and `b` is a list containing two elements `a[pb - 1]` and `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`. If `foundb` is `False`, then `b` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`. `i` is `i_prev + 1`. `foundb` is `True`.**
