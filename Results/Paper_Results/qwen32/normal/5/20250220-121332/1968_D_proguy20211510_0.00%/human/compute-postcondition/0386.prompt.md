Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, and P_S are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. p is a list of n integers where each element p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n. a is a list of n integers where each element a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `YES` is `'YES'`, `NO` is `'NO'`, `MOD` is 1000000007, `alpha` is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, pb, ps = input().split()
    n, k, pb, ps = int(n), int(k), int(pb), int(ps)
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    maxa = max(a)
    if a[pb - 1] == a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        print('Draw')
        continue
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        print('Bodya')
        continue
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        print('Sasha')
        continue
    b, s = [], []
    founds, foundb = False, False
    for i in range(k):
        if foundb and founds:
            b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
            s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
            break
        if foundb:
            b.append(maxa)
        elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
            foundb = True
            b.append(a[pb - 1])
        else:
            b.append(a[pb - 1])
            pb = p[pb - 1]
        if founds:
            s.append(maxa)
        elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
            founds = True
            s.append(a[ps - 1])
        else:
            s.append(a[ps - 1])
            ps = p[ps - 1]
    preb, pres = [], []
    sb, ss = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        preb.append(sb + b[i])
        sb += b[i]
        pres.append(ss + s[i])
        ss += s[i]
    ptsb, ptss = [], []
    for i in range(len(pres)):
        rem = k - (i + 1)
        ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])
        ptss.append(pres[i] + rem * s[i])
    maxs, maxb = max(ptss), max(ptsb)
    if maxs > maxb:
        print('Sasha')
    elif maxs < maxb:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ptsb` is a list with `len(pres)` elements `[preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1], ..., preb[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * b[len(pres) - 1]]`, and `ptss` is a list with `len(pres)` elements `[pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1], ..., pres[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * s[len(pres) - 1]]`. `maxs` is the maximum value in the `ptss` list, and `maxb` is the maximum value in the `ptsb` list`. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is strictly greater than `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`. If `maxs` is less than `maxb`, then `maxs` is strictly less than `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` is equal to `maxb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is unchanged, `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s`, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list with `len(pres)` elements calculated as `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `ptss` is a list with `len(pres)` elements calculated as `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is greater than `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is a list with `len(s)` elements representing cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list with `len(s)` elements, `sb` is the total sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the total sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list with `len(pres)` elements where each element is `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]`, `ptss` is a list with `len(pres)` elements where each element is `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution, `s` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then the conditions remain as stated in the if part. If `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`, then the conditions remain as stated in the else part.`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
