The code snippet `preb.append(sb + b[i])` appends the result of `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. Given that `i` is `i + 1` in the initial state, we can infer that `i` has already been incremented before this line of code is executed. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `s` must still be a list with at least `i + 2` elements. The list `preb` will now include the new element `sb + b[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `s` must be a list with at least `i + 2` elements, `i` is `i + 1`, `preb` includes the new element `sb + b[i]`**.
