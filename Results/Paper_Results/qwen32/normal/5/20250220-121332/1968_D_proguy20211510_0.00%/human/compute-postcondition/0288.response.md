The code `b.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Given that `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, the value `maxa` is appended to the list `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `maxs` is undefined, and `maxb` is undefined; `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, and `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`. `foundb` is `True`. `b` is a list containing the value `maxa`.**
