Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If both `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are equal to `maxa`, then no changes are made to the values of `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]`. Otherwise, if `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, it remains `maxa`; if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, no changes are made to `a[pb - 1]`. Similarly, if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, it remains `maxa`; if `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, no changes are made to `a[ps - 1]`. `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is False, `foundb` is False.`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, it remains `maxa`; if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, no changes are made to `a[pb - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, it remains `maxa`; if `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, no changes are made to `a[ps - 1]`. If `founds` is True, `b` is a list containing the value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` followed by `maxa`, and `s` is a list containing the value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa`. If `founds` is False, `b` contains the value `a[pb - 1]`, and `s` contains the value `a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, or `maxa` if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `i` is `i + 1`. If `foundb` is True, `b` has a new element appended which is `maxa`. If `foundb` is False, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, and `b` has a new element appended which is `a[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both true, `b` and `s` each have a new element appended which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes are made to `b` or `s` except as described. If `founds` is True, `s` now includes `maxa` as its new last element. If `founds` is False, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, and `s` has a new element appended which is `a[ps - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `i` is `i + 1`. If `foundb` is True, `b` has an additional element `maxa` appended to it. If `foundb` and `founds` are both true, `b` and `s` each have an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` appended to them, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `foundb` is False and `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, then `foundb` is set to True and `b` has an additional element `a[pb - 1]` appended to it. If `foundb` is False and `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, then `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` and `b` has an additional element `a[pb - 1]` appended to it. If `foundb` and `founds` are both true after these changes, `b` and `s` each have an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` appended to them, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `b` or `s`. If `founds` is True, `s` has an additional element `maxa` appended to it. If `founds` is False, `s` has an additional element `a[ps - 1]` appended to it, and if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `founds` is set to True. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
