Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the winner of a game involving two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their scores after a series of moves. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` (the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively), followed by the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Immediate Winning Condition**: The program first checks if the initial positions of Bodya and Sasha both have the maximum value in the array `a`. If so, it immediately declares a draw. If only Bodya's starting position has the maximum value, Bodya wins. If only Sasha's starting position has the maximum value, Sasha wins.

3. **Simulating Moves**: If the game doesn't end immediately, the program simulates up to `k` moves for both players. During each move, it updates the scores and positions of the players based on the rules provided:
   - If a player is on a position with the maximum value, they stay there for the remaining turns.
   - Otherwise, they move to the position indicated by the permutation `p`.

4. **Calculating Scores**: After simulating the moves, the program calculates the total scores for both players by considering the scores accumulated up to the point where they encountered the maximum value and the maximum value for the remaining turns.

5. **Determining the Winner**: Finally, the program compares the total scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the winner accordingly.

The program seems to follow the rules and logic of the problem accurately. However, there are a few potential issues to consider:
- The program assumes that the maximum value in `a` will be encountered within `k` moves. If the maximum value is not encountered within `k` moves, the program still calculates the score assuming the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns. This is correct based on the problem description.
- The program handles large values of `k` by breaking the loop once both players have encountered the maximum value, which is efficient.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles edge cases appropriately, it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
