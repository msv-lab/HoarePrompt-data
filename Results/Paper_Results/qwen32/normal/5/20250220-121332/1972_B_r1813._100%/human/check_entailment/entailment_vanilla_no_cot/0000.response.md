Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. The key insight is that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force a win by playing optimally. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can force a win. The program counts the number of 'U's in the string `s` and checks if this count is odd or even, printing 'YES' for an odd count and 'NO' for an even count, which aligns with the problem's requirements.
