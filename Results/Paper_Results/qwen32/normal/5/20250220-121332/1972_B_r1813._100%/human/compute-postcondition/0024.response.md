The code snippet `s = data[index + 1]` changes the value of `s` to the element at position `index + 1` in the list `data`. Given that `index` is 5, `s` will now hold the value of `data[6]`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `data` is still a list of strings where the first element `t` is `data[0] - 2`.
- `index` is still 5.
- `n` is still the integer value of `data[5]`.
- `count_u` is still the number of occurrences of 'U' in the original `s` (which was `data[4]`).

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element `t` is `data[0] - 2`; `index` is 5; `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`; `s` is `data[6]`; `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `data[4]`.**
