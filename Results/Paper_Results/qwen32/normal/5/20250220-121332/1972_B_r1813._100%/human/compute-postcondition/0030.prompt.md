Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings where the first element is the number of test cases `t`, and the following elements are the values of `n` and the strings `s` for each test case; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `index` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    s = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    count_u = s.count('U')
    if count_u % 2 == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings where the first element `t` is a positive integer (at least 1), `index` is 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is `data[2]`, `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s`. If `count_u` is odd, then `count_u` is odd. Otherwise, `count_u` is even.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings where the first element `t` is `data[0] - 1`; `index` is 5; `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`; `s` is `data[4]`; `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s`. The value of `count_u` remains unchanged regardless of whether it is odd or even.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings where the first element `t` is `data[0] - 2`; `index` is 7; `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`; `s` is `data[6]`; `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `data[6]`. Regardless of whether `count_u` is odd or even, the values of `data`, `index`, `n`, `s`, and `count_u` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
