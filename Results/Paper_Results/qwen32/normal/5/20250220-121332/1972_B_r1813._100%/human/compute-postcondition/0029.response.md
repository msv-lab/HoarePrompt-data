Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element `t` is `data[0] - 2`; `index` is 7; `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`; `s` is `data[6]`; `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `data[6]`. Regardless of whether `count_u` is odd or even, the values of `data`, `index`, `n`, `s`, and `count_u` remain unchanged.**
