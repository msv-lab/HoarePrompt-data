### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the number of coins facing up. The game's outcome hinges on whether the number of up-facing coins (`'U'`) is odd or even. The key insight is that if the number of up-facing coins is odd, Alice will win if both players play optimally. This is because Alice can always force Bob into a position where he faces an even number of up-facing coins, and eventually, Bob will be left with no up-facing coins to flip, making Alice the winner. Conversely, if the number of up-facing coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and force Alice into losing positions.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of up-facing coins (`'U'`) for each test case and printing "YES" if the count is odd and "NO" if it is even. The execution summary confirms that the function processes each test case as described and outputs the correct result based on the count of `'U'`.
