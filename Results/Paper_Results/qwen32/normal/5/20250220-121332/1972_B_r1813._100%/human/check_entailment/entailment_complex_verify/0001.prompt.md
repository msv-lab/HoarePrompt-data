You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting only of "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.

    index = 1

        count_u = s.count('U')
        
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `data` is a list of strings where the first element `t` is `0`, `index` is `2 * t + 1` which is `1`, no further `n` or `s` are processed, and all test cases have been evaluated.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of coins and their orientations ("U" for up, "D" for down). For each test case, it determines if the number of coins facing up is odd, and prints "YES" if it is, otherwise "NO".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided Python program appears to solve the problem by determining the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the given configuration of coins. The key insight is that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases `t`, followed by pairs of lines for each test case: the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of each coin.
2. For each test case, it counts the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.
3. It then checks if this count is odd or even:
   - If the count is odd, Alice wins, and the program outputs "YES".
   - If the count is even, Bob wins, and the program outputs "NO".

The reasoning behind this strategy is based on the observation that:
- Each move flips two adjacent coins, changing the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
- If the number of facing-up coins is odd at the start, Alice can always force Bob to face an even number of facing-up coins, and eventually, Bob will face a situation where there are no more facing-up coins left, making Alice the winner.
- Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even at the start, Bob can always force Alice to face an odd number of facing-up coins, and eventually, Alice will face a situation where there are no more facing-up coins left, making Bob the winner.

The program correctly implements this logic and handles the input as described in the problem statement.
