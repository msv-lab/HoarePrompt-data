Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down. The `input` variable is assigned the value of `sys.stdin.read`, which reads all the input at once.**

In natural language: The input remains the same as described, with `t` test cases provided, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s`. The `input` variable now holds the entire input read from standard input.
