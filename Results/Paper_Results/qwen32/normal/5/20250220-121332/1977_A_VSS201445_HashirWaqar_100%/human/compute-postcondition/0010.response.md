The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the conditions involving the integers `t`, `n`, and `m`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `m`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes the constraints on `t`, `n`, and `m`, but these constraints are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print('NO')`, which directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of `t`, `n`, or `m`, the output is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
