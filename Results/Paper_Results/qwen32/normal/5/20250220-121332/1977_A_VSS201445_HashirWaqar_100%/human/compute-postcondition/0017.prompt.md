Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, then `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even. Otherwise, either `n` is less than `m` or the difference between `n` and `m` is not even.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. The condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` is either true or false, but in either case, `n` and `m` maintain their original values and the relationship between them remains the same as described in the precondition. If `n >= m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, then `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even. Otherwise, either `n` is less than `m` or the difference between `n` and `m` is not even.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; the condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` is either true or false based on the new values of `n` and `m`; `iterations_left` is the number of iterations left to execute, which is `int(input()) - 1`. The condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` determines whether the if or else part was executed, but the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `iterations_left` remain as specified in the precondition regardless of the condition outcome.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
