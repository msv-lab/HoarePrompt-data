Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube. The key insight is that the difference `n - m` must be non-negative and even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and to go from 0 cubes to `m` cubes in `n` moves, the number of additions must be exactly `m` and the number of removals must be `n - m`. For the total number of moves to be `n`, the difference `(n - m)` must be even, as it represents the net number of removals after accounting for the `m` additions.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This matches the problem's requirements and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
