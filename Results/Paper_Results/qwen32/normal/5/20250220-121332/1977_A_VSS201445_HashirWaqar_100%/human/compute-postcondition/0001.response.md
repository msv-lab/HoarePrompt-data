The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and `int(input())` is equal to `t`. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `m` will be set to the two integers read from the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.**
