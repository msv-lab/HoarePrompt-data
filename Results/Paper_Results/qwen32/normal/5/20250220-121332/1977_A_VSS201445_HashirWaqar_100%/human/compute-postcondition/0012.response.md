The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used within the loop body. Since the loop iterates based on the value provided by `int(input())`, this value determines how many times the loop will execute. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can execute one more time. This means we need to ensure that the input value (which we'll call `iterations_left`) is decremented by 1, so that the loop can continue executing.

However, since the loop head does not directly involve `t`, `n`, or `m`, and the loop iterates based on the input value, we only need to consider the state of the input value itself. Let's denote the input value as `iterations_left`, which is initially set to `int(input())`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. The condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` is either true or false, but in either case, `n` and `m` maintain their original values and the relationship between them remains the same as described in the precondition. `iterations_left` is the number of iterations left to execute, which is initially `int(input())`.

Since the loop iterates based on `iterations_left`, at the start of the next iteration, `iterations_left` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. The condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` is either true or false, but in either case, `n` and `m` maintain their original values and the relationship between them remains the same as described in the precondition. `iterations_left` is the number of iterations left to execute, which is `int(input()) - 1`.**
