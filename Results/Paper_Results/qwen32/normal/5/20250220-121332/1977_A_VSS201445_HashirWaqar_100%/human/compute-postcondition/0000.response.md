To determine the state necessary for the given for loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variable here is the result of `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will iterate. 

The loop will execute if the value of `int(input())` is greater than 0. Given the problem statement, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. However, these variables (`t`, `n`, `m`) are not directly part of the loop head, so we can't adjust them directly to make the loop execute. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`.

Since the loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0, and `t` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 100, we need to ensure that `int(input())` reflects this value. Therefore, we can assume that `int(input())` will be equal to `t`, which is already guaranteed to be a positive integer within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and `int(input())` is equal to `t`**
