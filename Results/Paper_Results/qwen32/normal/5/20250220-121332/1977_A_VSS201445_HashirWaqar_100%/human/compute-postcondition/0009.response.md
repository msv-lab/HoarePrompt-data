The provided initial state describes conditions related to the variables `n` and `m`, but it does not affect the execution of the `print('YES')` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the conditions involving `n` and `m` and will always execute, regardless of the values of `n` and `m`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The variable `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. However, `t` is not used in the provided print statement.
2. The variables `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
3. The conditions involving `n` and `m` (whether `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference between `n` and `m` is even) are described, but these conditions do not influence the `print` statement.
4. The `print('YES')` statement will execute and print "YES" to the console.

Since the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `n`, `m`, or `t`, the output will always be "YES".

Output: **YES**
