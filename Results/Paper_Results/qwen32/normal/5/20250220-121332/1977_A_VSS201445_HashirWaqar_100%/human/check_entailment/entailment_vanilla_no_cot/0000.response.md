To determine if the provided Python program is correct, let's analyze the logic step by step based on the problem description.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move. The goal is to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Observations:
1. **Addition and Removal Balance**: For every addition of a cube, there must be a corresponding removal to decrease the count, and vice versa.
2. **Parity Consideration**: The difference between the number of moves (`n`) and the final number of cubes (`m`) must be even. This is because each addition or removal changes the count by 1, and thus, an even number of moves will result in an even difference between `n` and `m` if the final count `m` is achievable.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It then checks if `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. If both conditions are true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

- **Condition `n >= m`**: This ensures that the number of moves is at least as many as the number of cubes required. It's a necessary condition because if `n < m`, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes since you can't remove more cubes than you've added.
- **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`**: This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the final number of cubes is even, which is required for the feasibility of achieving the exact count `m` through a series of additions and removals.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, based on the given constraints and observations.

Correctness: **True**
