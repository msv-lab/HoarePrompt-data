Output State: **The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations. For each iteration, `n` and `m` were integers read from the input, and the condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` was evaluated. If the condition was true, "YES" was printed; otherwise, "NO" was printed. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` from the input remain unchanged in the context of the precondition, and no further iterations are left to execute.**

In simpler terms: The loop has completed all its iterations as specified by `t`. For each pair of `n` and `m` read from the input, it printed "YES" if `n` was greater than or equal to `m` and their difference was even; otherwise, it printed "NO". The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `m` from the input remain as they were, and there are no more iterations to perform.
