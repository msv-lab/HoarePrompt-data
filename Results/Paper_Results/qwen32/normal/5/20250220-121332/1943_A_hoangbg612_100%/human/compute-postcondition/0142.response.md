The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the last element of `N` plus 1, `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their counts, and the sum of the values in `M` is equal to `S`.
