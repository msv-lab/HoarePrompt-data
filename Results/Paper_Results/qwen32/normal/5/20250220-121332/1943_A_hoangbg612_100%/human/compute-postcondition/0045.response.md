Postcondition: **`cur` is the last element of `N` that was processed without breaking the loop, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the sum of the values in `M`, and `cnt` is a list. If `M[k]` is equal to 1, `cnt` contains the key `k`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains an empty list. `k` is the next key in `M.keys()` after the last processed key.**
