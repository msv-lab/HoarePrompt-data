The code provided reads a line of input from the user, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `N`. The variables `cur`, `M`, `S`, `cnt`, and `T` are mentioned in the initial state, but their values are not altered by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`cur` remains the same as in the initial state, `M` remains unchanged, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from `M` that have a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input.**
