Postcondition: **`cur` is the largest number in `N` processed without a gap greater than 1, incremented by 1 if the sum of the counts of all unique numbers in `M` equals `S`. `M` is a dictionary with counts of each unique number in `N` and must have at least one key-value pair, and the count of the key `k` in `M` is 1. `S` is the integer value from user input. `cnt` is an empty list. `T` is decremented by 1. `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order.**
