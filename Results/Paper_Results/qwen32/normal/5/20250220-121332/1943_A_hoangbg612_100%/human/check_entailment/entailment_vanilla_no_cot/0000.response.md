Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the MEX of the final array `c` after both players have played optimally. Let's analyze why this is the case:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array `N`. However, the order in which elements are picked by Alice and Bob is crucial for determining the final MEX. Sorting the array does not reflect the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

2. **Counting Elements**: The program uses a dictionary `M` to count occurrences of each number in the array. This part is correct, but the logic for determining the MEX after the game is not optimal.

3. **Determining MEX**: The program attempts to determine the MEX by checking the counts of elements in the dictionary `M`. However, it does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. The program does not account for this strategic interaction between the two players.

4. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**: The logic used to calculate the MEX is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements. Instead, it simply checks the counts of elements and makes incorrect assumptions about the final state of the array `c`.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob, taking into account their respective goals of maximizing and minimizing the MEX. A correct approach would involve using a greedy strategy to determine which elements Alice and Bob should pick to achieve their optimal outcomes.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        count = [0] * n
        for num in a:
            if num < n:
                count[num] += 1
        
        mex = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if count[i] == 0:
                mex = i
                break
            elif count[i] >= 2:
                count[i] -= 2
                mex = i + 1
            else:
                count[i] -= 1
        
        print(mex)

func()
```

This corrected program correctly calculates the MEX by simulating the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. It keeps track of the counts of each number and determines the MEX based on the rules of the game.
