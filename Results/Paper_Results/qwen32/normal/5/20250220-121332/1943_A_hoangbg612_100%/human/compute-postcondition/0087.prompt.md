Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is -1, `M` is {}, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` is either `num` or -1, `M` is either `{num: 1}` or `{-1: 1}`, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one integer. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `cur` is updated to `num` and `M` is updated to `{num: 1}`. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1 and `M` is updated to `{-1: 1}`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cur` is either `num` or -1, `M` is either `{num: 1}`, `{num: 2}`, or `{-1: 2}`, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one integer, `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num > cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num`, `M` is updated to include `{num: 1}`, and if `num > cur + 1`, `cur` is further updated to `num + 1` or `0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `num <= cur`, `M` is updated to `{num: 2}` or `{-1: 2}`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur` is either `num` or -1. `M` is either `{num: 1}`, `{num: 2}`, `{num: 3}`, or `{-1: 2, num: 1}`, or `{-1: 3}`. `S` is the integer value from user input. `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1. `T` is decremented by 1. `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one more integer. `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num > cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num` and `M` is updated to either `{num: 1}` or `{-1: 2, num: 1}`. Otherwise, `M` is updated to either `{num: 2}`, `{num: 3}`, or `{-1: 3}`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
