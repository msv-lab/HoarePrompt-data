Output State: **`cur` is either `num + 1` or `0`, `M` is either `{num: 1}`, `{num: 2}`, or `{-1: 2}`, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one more integer, `num` is the next element in `N` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `cur`, `M`, `S`, `cnt`, `T`, `N`, and `num` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that it exits the most internal loop or if statement.
