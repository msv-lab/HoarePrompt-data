The value of `cur` is updated to be equal to `num`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least two elements, `num` is the next element in `N` to be processed, and `cur` is now equal to `num`.
