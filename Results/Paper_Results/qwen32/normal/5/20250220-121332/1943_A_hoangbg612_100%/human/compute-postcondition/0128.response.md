The code snippet `cur = num` directly assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the value of `cur` will now be the same as the value of `num`.

Output State: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N` to be processed, `cur` is equal to `num`.**
