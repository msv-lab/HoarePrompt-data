The code snippet `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to the variable `cur`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cur` is equal to `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1.**
