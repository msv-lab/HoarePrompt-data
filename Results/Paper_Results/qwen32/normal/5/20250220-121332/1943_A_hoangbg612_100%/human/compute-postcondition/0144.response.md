The code snippet provided is:
```
cnt = []
```
This line of code reassigns the `cnt` variable to an empty list, effectively clearing any previous contents it might have had. The other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, `cur`, and `M`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`cnt` is an empty list; `T` is `T-1`; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers; `cur` is the last element of `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last element of `N`; `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their counts.**
