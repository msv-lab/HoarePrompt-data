Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    S = int(input())
    N = list(map(int, input().split()))
    N.sort()
    cur = -1
    M = {}
    for num in N:
        if num > cur:
            if num > cur + 1:
                cur += 1
                break
            cur = num
            M[cur] = 1
        else:
            M[cur] += 1
    if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
        cur += 1
    cnt = []
    for k in M.keys():
        if M[k] == 1:
            cnt.append(k)
    if len(cnt) >= 2:
        cur = cnt[1]
    print(cur)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` remains the same as in the initial state, `M` and `S` remain unchanged, and `cnt` contains all keys from `M` that have a value of 1. If the length of `cnt` is 2 or more, `cur` is set to the second element of `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cnt` is a list. If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, `cur` is set to `cnt[1]`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged or is not set.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cnt` contains all unique elements from `N` that have a count of 1 in `M`. If `cnt` has at least 2 elements, `cur` is set to the second element of `cnt`. Otherwise, `cur` remains the last element of `N` if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, or it remains unchanged. `T` is decremented by 1. `S` is an input integer, and `N` is a sorted list of integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
