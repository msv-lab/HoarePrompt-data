To determine the value that will be printed by the `print(cur)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state step by step:

1. **`cnt` Definition**: `cnt` contains all unique elements from `N` that have a count of 1 in `M`. This means `cnt` is a list of elements from `N` that appear exactly once in `M`.

2. **`cur` Assignment**:
   - If `cnt` has at least 2 elements, `cur` is set to the second element of `cnt`.
   - Otherwise, `cur` remains the last element of `N` if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, `cur` remains unchanged.

3. **`T` and `S`**:
   - `T` is decremented by 1, but this does not affect the value of `cur`.
   - `S` is an input integer.
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers.

Given the information, we can derive the following:

- If `cnt` has at least 2 elements, `cur` is explicitly set to the second element of `cnt`.
- If `cnt` has fewer than 2 elements, we need to check if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`. If it does, `cur` is set to the last element of `N`.
- If `cnt` has fewer than 2 elements and the sum of the values in `M` does not equal `S`, `cur` remains unchanged. However, the problem does not provide information about what `cur` was before this assignment, so we cannot determine this value precisely.

Since the exact values of `N`, `M`, `S`, and the initial value of `cur` are not provided, we can only describe `cur` in terms of the conditions given:

- If `cnt` has at least 2 elements, `cur` is the second element of `cnt`.
- If `cnt` has fewer than 2 elements and the sum of `M` equals `S`, `cur` is the last element of `N`.
- Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged, but we do not know its initial value.

Given the conditions and the lack of specific values, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **cur (where cur is the second element of cnt if cnt has at least 2 elements, or the last element of N if cnt has fewer than 2 elements and the sum of M equals S, or unchanged otherwise)**
