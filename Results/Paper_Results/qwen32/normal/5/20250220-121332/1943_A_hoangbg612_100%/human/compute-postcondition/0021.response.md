Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the next element in `N` after the previously processed element. If `num` > `cur + 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur` and the loop or if statement continues.**
