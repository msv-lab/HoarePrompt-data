The code snippet `M[cur] = 1` sets the value of the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` to 1. Given that `cur` is `num`, this means the value associated with the key `num` in the dictionary `M` will be set to 1.

Let's analyze the possible states of `M` before the execution:

1. If `M` was `{num: 1}`, then setting `M[num] = 1` does not change `M`.
2. If `M` was `{num: 2}`, then setting `M[num] = 1` changes `M` to `{num: 1}`.
3. If `M` was `{-1: 2}`, then setting `M[num] = 1` changes `M` to `{-1: 2, num: 1}`.

The variables `S`, `cnt`, `T`, and `N` are not affected by this line of code. The variable `num` is the next element in `N` and `cur` is `num`, but their values do not change due to this operation.

Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `M` is either `{num: 1}` or `{-1: 2, num: 1}`, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one more integer, `num` is the next element in `N`.**
