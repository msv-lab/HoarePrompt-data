Postcondition: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, `num` is greater than `cur` (which is -1), and the current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1` (i.e., `num` is greater than 0).**
