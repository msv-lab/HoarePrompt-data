Postcondition: **`cur` is the last element of `N` that was processed without breaking the loop, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the sum of the values in `M`, and `cnt` is a list. If `M[k] == 1`, `cnt` includes `k` as its last element. If `M[k] != 1`, `cnt` remains unchanged. `k` is the next key in `M.keys()` after `cur`.**
