Output State: **`cnt` is a list with the last element being `k`, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one unique element, `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their counts, and `M` must be non-empty, `cur` is the last element of `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last element of `N`, `k` is the next key in the iteration order of `M.keys()`.**

In simpler terms, the list `cnt` now includes the key `k` at the end. All other variables retain their initial values unless specifically changed by the code snippet.
