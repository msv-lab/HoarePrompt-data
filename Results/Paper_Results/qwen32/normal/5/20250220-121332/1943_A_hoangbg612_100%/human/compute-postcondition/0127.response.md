Postcondition: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N` to be processed. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is updated to `cur + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
