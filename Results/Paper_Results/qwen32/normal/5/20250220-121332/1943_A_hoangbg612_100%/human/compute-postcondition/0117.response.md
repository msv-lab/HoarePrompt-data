Output State: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `cur` is 0, `M` is an empty dictionary, `num` is greater than `cur` (which is 0), and the current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1` (i.e., `num` is greater than 1). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
