To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the MEX of the array `c` after both players, Alice and Bob, play optimally.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads multiple test cases and processes each one individually.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list `N` which contains the elements of the array `a`. Sorting helps in determining the smallest missing non-negative integer efficiently.

3. **Tracking Elements**: The program uses a dictionary `M` to keep track of the count of each number in the sorted list `N`.

4. **Determining MEX**:
    - It initializes `cur` to -1 and iterates through the sorted list `N`.
    - If the current number in the list (`num`) is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If true, it sets `cur` to `cur + 1` and breaks out of the loop. If false, it sets `cur` to `num` and updates the dictionary `M`.
    - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.
    - After the loop, if the sum of the counts in `M` matches `S` (the size of the array `N`), it increments `cur` by 1. This step ensures that if all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present in `M`, then `cur + 1` is the MEX.
    - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys from `M` that have a count of 1. If there are at least two such keys, it sets `cur` to the second smallest key in `M`. This step seems to be an attempt to handle cases where there are multiple occurrences of the same numbers, but it does not correctly compute the MEX in all scenarios.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for determining `cur` after the loop is not optimal and may not always yield the correct MEX. Specifically, the step where `cur` is set to the second smallest key in `M` if there are multiple keys with a count of 1 is incorrect. This does not necessarily give the smallest missing non-negative integer in all cases.
- The program does not correctly handle scenarios where there are multiple occurrences of the same numbers and where the MEX needs to be determined based on the absence of a particular number rather than the count of numbers.

### Correctness:
The program does not always produce the correct MEX for the array `c` after both players play optimally. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

**Correctness: False**
