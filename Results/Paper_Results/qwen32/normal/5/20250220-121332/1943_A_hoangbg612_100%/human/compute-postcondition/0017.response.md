Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `M` becomes a dictionary with the key `cur` and value `1`, `cur` is updated to `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1. If `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, `cur` remains -1 and `M` is a dictionary with `M[-1]` equal to 1.**
