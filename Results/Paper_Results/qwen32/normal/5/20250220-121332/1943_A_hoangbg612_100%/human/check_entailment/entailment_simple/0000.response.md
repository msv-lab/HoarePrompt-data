Let's analyze the provided Python program and compare it with the problem description and the expected behavior.

### Problem Analysis:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` while Bob wants to minimize it.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- The optimal strategy involves both players playing optimally, i.e., Alice picks the largest possible element that can increase the MEX, and Bob picks the smallest possible element that can minimize the MEX.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `S` of the array and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `N` is sorted, which helps in easily finding the smallest and largest elements.

3. **Tracking Elements:**
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the count of each element in `N`.
   - The variable `cur` is used to keep track of the current MEX.

4. **Calculating MEX:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N`.
   - If a number is greater than `cur`, it checks if there is a gap (i.e., `num > cur + 1`). If there is, it increments `cur` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the number is equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.
   - If the sum of counts in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.

5. **Handling Special Cases:**
   - The program creates a list `cnt` of keys in `M` with a count of 1.
   - If there are at least two such keys, it sets `cur` to the second smallest key.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `cur` for each test case, which is supposed to be the final MEX.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program's logic for calculating the MEX is flawed. The condition `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S` is incorrect. This condition checks if all elements in `N` are unique, which is not the correct approach to determine the MEX.
- The logic for handling the case when there are multiple elements with a count of 1 is also incorrect. This part of the code does not correctly reflect the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for determining the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
