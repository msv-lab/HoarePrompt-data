The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the program in any meaningful way. The loop depends on the variable `T` to determine how many times it will execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `T` must be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`cnt` is a list. If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, `cur` is set to `cnt[1]`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged or is not set. `T` is decremented by 1**
