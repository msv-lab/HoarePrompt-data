Output State: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N` to be processed, `cur` is now `cur + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language explanation: The values of `cnt`, `T`, `S`, `N`, `num`, and the updated `cur` remain as described. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without further changes to these variables.
