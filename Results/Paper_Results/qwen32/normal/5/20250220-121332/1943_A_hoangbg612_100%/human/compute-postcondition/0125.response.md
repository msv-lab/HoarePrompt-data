Output State: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N` to be processed. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and `1` as its value, and `cur` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, `cur` remains `-1`, and `M` is a dictionary with `-1` as a key and `1` as its value. `cur` is now `cur + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their descriptions and values relative to `cur`.
