Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly implements the optimal strategy for the game described.

### Problem Recap:
- **Alice** wants to maximize the MEX of the final array `c`.
- **Bob** wants to minimize the MEX of the final array `c`.
- Both play optimally.
- MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c`.

### Strategy Analysis:
1. **Alice's Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should aim to include as many small numbers as possible in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Since Alice goes first, she can strategically pick numbers to ensure that the MEX is as high as possible.

2. **Bob's Optimal Strategy**:
   - Bob should aim to block Alice from including certain numbers in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - Bob can remove numbers that Alice would otherwise pick to reduce the MEX.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case independently.
- For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
- It sorts the array `a` and then iterates through it to determine the MEX.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Sorting**: The array `a` is sorted. This is a good first step because it helps in easily finding the smallest missing number.
2. **Tracking Numbers**: A dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences of each number.
3. **Determining MEX**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted array and updates `cur` to the smallest missing number.
   - If a number in the sorted array is greater than `cur + 1`, it breaks out of the loop, indicating that `cur + 1` is the smallest missing number.
4. **Final Adjustment**:
   - It checks if all numbers from `0` to `cur` are included in the array. If not, it increments `cur`.
   - It then checks for numbers that appear only once and updates `cur` based on this information.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program's logic for determining the MEX is flawed. It does not correctly account for the optimal moves of both players.
- **Ignoring Optimal Play**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. It simply calculates the MEX based on the sorted array, which does not reflect the optimal strategy of both players.
- **Incorrect Handling of Counts**: The logic for handling numbers that appear only once and updating `cur` is not aligned with the game's rules.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. It calculates the MEX based on a simple iteration through the sorted array without simulating the game's turns. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program does not correctly simulate the game's turns and does not account for the optimal strategies of both Alice and Bob. It incorrectly calculates the MEX based on a simple iteration through the sorted array.
Correctness: **False**
