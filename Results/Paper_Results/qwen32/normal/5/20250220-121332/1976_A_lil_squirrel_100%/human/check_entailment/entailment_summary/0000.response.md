Reasoning: 
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic required to verify the strength of the passwords based on the given conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Separate Letters and Digits:** The program iterates through the password and separates the characters into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.

2. **Check Sorting:** It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is not, the program returns 'NO'. Similarly, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is not, the program returns 'NO'.

3. **Check Letter-Digit Sequence:** The program then iterates through the password to ensure that no digit directly follows a letter. If it finds such a case, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Return 'YES':** If all checks pass, the program returns 'YES'.

The program handles all the conditions specified in the problem description. The execution summary accurately describes the function's behavior, and the example inputs and outputs provided in the problem are correctly handled by the program.

Correctness: **True**
