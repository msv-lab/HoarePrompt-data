Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is the next character in the `password` string. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is a list that includes `ch` as its last element. Otherwise, `letters` is a list that includes `ch` as its last element and `digits` remains unchanged.**
