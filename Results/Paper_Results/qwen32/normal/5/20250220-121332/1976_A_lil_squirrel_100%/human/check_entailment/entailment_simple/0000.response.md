### Reasoning:
The given Python program is designed to check if a password meets the specified conditions for being considered "strong." Let's break down the logic and verify if it correctly implements the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and for each test case, it reads the length of the password (`n`) and the password string itself (`password`).

2. **Splitting Characters**: Inside the `func_1` function, the program iterates through each character in the password. It separates the characters into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.

3. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Checking Digit Placement**:
   - The program checks if there is any digit that comes immediately after a letter in the password string. If such a pair is found, it returns 'NO'.

5. **Returning Result**:
   - If none of the above conditions cause the function to return 'NO', the function returns 'YES', indicating the password is strong.

### Verification:
- **Condition 1**: The password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits (already ensured by the problem statement and the input constraints).
- **Condition 2**: No digit comes after a letter. This is checked by the loop that iterates through the password and ensures no letter is immediately followed by a digit.
- **Condition 3**: All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order. This is checked by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version.
- **Condition 4**: All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order. This is checked by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version.

The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
