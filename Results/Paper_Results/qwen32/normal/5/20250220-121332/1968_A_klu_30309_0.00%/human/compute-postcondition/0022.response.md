Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` such that 2 <= x <= 1000 and returns an integer `y` that maximizes the expression `gcd(x, y) + y`. Specifically, it returns the first divisor `y` of `x` such that `2 * y >= x`, or the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x / 2` if no such `y` exists.**
