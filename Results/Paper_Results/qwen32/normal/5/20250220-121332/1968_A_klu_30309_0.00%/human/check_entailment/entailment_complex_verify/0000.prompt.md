You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` such that 2 <= x <= 1000 and returns an integer `y` that maximizes the expression `gcd(x, y) + y`. Specifically, it returns the first divisor `y` of `x` such that `2 * y >= x`, or the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x / 2` if no such `y` exists.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not always find the integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). 

Let's analyze the code:
- The function `func_1` iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
- It checks if \( x \% y == 0 \) (i.e., \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \)).
- If \( 2 \times y \geq x \), it immediately returns \( y \).
- Otherwise, it updates `max_val` to \( y \) and continues.
- Finally, it returns `max_val`.

The problem with this approach is that it might not always choose the \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Specifically, the condition \( 2 \times y \geq x \) is too restrictive and does not guarantee the optimal \( y \).

Let's consider a counterexample:

For \( x = 12 \):
- The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11.
- The values of \( \gcd(12, y) + y \) for these divisors are:
  - \( \gcd(12, 11) + 11 = 1 + 11 = 12 \)
  - \( \gcd(12, 6) + 6 = 6 + 6 = 12 \)
  - \( \gcd(12, 4) + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8 \)
  - \( \gcd(12, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \)
  - \( \gcd(12, 2) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4 \)
  - \( \gcd(12, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)

The maximum value is 12, which can be achieved by either \( y = 11 \) or \( y = 6 \). However, the code might not always return the correct \( y \) because of the condition \( 2 \times y \geq x \).

For \( x = 12 \), the code will check \( y = 11 \) first, and since \( 2 \times 11 \geq 12 \) is true, it will return 11. This is correct in this case, but it might not be correct for other values of \( x \).

To ensure correctness, the code should evaluate \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for all \( y \) and keep track of the maximum value found, rather than using the restrictive condition \( 2 \times y \geq x \).

Thus, the code is incorrect for some potential cases.
