Given the initial state and the code to execute, we can determine the output state as follows:

- `x` is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000.
- `max_val` is 1 (though `max_val` is not used in the code snippet provided).
- `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`).
- `2 * y` is greater than or equal to `x`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
return y
```

Since the code returns `y`, we need to determine the possible values of `y` given the constraints. The constraints imply that `y` must be a divisor of `x` and `2 * y >= x`. This means `y` must be at least `x / 2` and at most `x` itself, but since `y` must divide `x` exactly, `y` can only be `x / 2` if `x` is even, or `x` itself if `x` is odd, or any other divisor of `x` that satisfies `2 * y >= x`.

However, since we are not given a specific value for `x`, we can only describe `y` in terms of `x`. The program will return a value `y` that is a divisor of `x` and satisfies `2 * y >= x`.

Output State: **The program returns `y`, which is a divisor of `x` and satisfies `2 * y >= x`.**
