Given the initial conditions and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `x` is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000.
- `y` is `x - 2`.
- If `2 * y` is greater than or equal to `x`, the program returns `y`.
- Otherwise, the postcondition is determined by the initial conditions of `max_val` based on the divisibility of `x` by `y`.
- `max_val` is initially set to `y`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
max_val = y
```

This line of code sets `max_val` to the value of `y`. Since `y` was already defined as `x - 2`, `max_val` is now also `x - 2`.

Next, we need to consider the condition `if 2 * y >= x`. If this condition is true, the program returns `y`. If not, `max_val` is set to `y` as per the code, but this is already the case, so no change occurs in that scenario.

Let's analyze the condition:
- `2 * y >= x` translates to `2 * (x - 2) >= x`, which simplifies to `2x - 4 >= x` or `x >= 4`.
- Since `x` is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000, the condition `x >= 4` is true for all `x` except when `x = 3`.

Therefore, if `x = 3`, the condition `2 * y >= x` is false, and `max_val` is set to `y` (which is `x - 2` or `1` in this case). However, since the problem states that if `2 * y >= x` the program returns `y`, and for `x = 3`, this condition is not met, the program does not return `y` but continues to set `max_val` to `y`.

For all other values of `x` (4 <= x <= 1000), the condition `2 * y >= x` is true, and the program returns `y` (which is `x - 2`). However, the code snippet only sets `max_val` to `y`, and does not include the return statement, so we focus on the value of `max_val`.

Thus, the output state is:
- `x` remains an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000.
- `y` is `x - 2`.
- `max_val` is `y` (or `x - 2`).

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000; `y` is `x - 2`; `max_val` is `x - 2`.**
