The given code snippet is a function definition and does not actually execute any code. It only describes the purpose and expected behavior of a function that is supposed to find the value of `y` that maximizes the expression `gcd(x, y) + y`, given an integer `x` where `2 <= x <= 1000`.

Since the function is not called and no variables are assigned or modified, the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.**
