The code snippet creates a new list `a` by converting elements from a slice of `data` starting at `index` and ending at `index + n` into integers. The value of `index` is not changed by this operation, but `a` is now a list of integers derived from the specified slice of `data`.

Given the initial state, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is unchanged; `results` now includes `str(last_year)` as its last element; `T` must be greater than the current number of iterations; `n` is `int(data[index])`; `index` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`.**

Natural language: The variable `t` remains unchanged. The list `results` now includes the string representation of `last_year` as its last element. The variable `T` must still be greater than the current number of iterations. The variable `n` retains its value as `int(data[index])`. The variable `index` is incremented by 1. A new variable `a` is created and contains a list of integers converted from the slice `data[index:index + n]`.
