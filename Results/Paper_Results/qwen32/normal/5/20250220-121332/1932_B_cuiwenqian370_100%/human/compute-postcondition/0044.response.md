The code `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `index` was already incremented by 1 previously, and now it is further incremented by the value of `n`. Therefore, `index` is now `index + n`.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged; `results` includes `str(last_year)` as its last element and now also includes another `str(last_year)` as its new last element; `T` is still greater than the current number of iterations; `n` is `int(data[index - n])`; `index` is incremented by `n`; `a` is derived from `data[index - n:index]` and now contains the integers from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is the next multiple of `a[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to the value of `last_year` after the previous iteration; `_` is incremented by 1.**
