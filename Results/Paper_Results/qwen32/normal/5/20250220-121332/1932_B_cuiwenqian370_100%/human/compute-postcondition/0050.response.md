The code snippet calculates a new value for `next_year` based on the values of `last_year`, `a[i]`, and the current value of `i`. The value of `i` is not changed by this snippet, but `next_year` is newly assigned. The precondition `n` must be greater than `i + 1` remains unchanged.

To determine the new value of `next_year`, we use the formula provided:
\[ \text{next\_year} = (\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i] \]

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ \text{next\_year} = (\text{last\_year} + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i] \]

This means `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `next_year` is `((last_year + a[i]) // a[i]) * a[i]`**.
