The code `index += n` increments the value of `index` by the value of `n`. The other variables (`t`, `results`, `T`, `n`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged; `results` now includes `str(last_year)` as its last element; `T` must be greater than the current number of iterations; `n` is `int(data[index - n])`; `index` is incremented by `n`; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`.**

In simpler terms, `index` is now `index + n`, and all other variables retain their previous values.
