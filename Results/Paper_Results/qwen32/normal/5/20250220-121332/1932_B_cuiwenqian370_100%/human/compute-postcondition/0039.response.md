The code `results.append(str(last_year))` appends the string representation of `last_year` to the list `results`. The other variables (`t`, `T`, `n`, `index`, `a`, and `last_year`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged; `results` includes `str(last_year)` as its last element and now also includes another `str(last_year)` as its new last element; `T` is still greater than the current number of iterations; `n` is unchanged; `index` is incremented by `n`; `a` is derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is the next multiple of `a[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to the value of `last_year` after the previous iteration.**
