The code snippet provided updates the value of `last_year` to be equal to `next_year`. None of the other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the Output State will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, with `data[0]` being a string representation of an integer T such that 1 <= T <= 1000; `index` is `2 + n`; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `last_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[3]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`; `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[3]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`; `i` is 3**
