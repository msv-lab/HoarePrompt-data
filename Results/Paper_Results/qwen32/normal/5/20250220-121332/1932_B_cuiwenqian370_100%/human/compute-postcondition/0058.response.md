Output State: **`t` is unchanged; `data` is unchanged; `index` is incremented by the total number of elements processed across all test cases plus the number of test cases; `T` is unchanged; `results` contains `T` string elements representing the final `last_year` for each test case; the `results` are written to the standard output with each result on a new line, followed by an additional newline character.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `t`, `data`, `index`, `T`, and `results` remain as they were before, except that the contents of `results` are printed to the console, with each result on a separate line and an extra newline at the end.
