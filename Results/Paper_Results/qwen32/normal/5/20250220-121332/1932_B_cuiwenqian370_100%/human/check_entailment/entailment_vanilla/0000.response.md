Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
1. We need to find the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given that each sign occurs at regular intervals and the next sign can only occur after the previous one.
2. For each sign, we know the interval at which it occurs.
3. The first sign occurs at the first multiple of its interval.
4. The second sign occurs at the first multiple of its interval that comes after the year the first sign occurred.
5. This pattern continues for all signs.

### Code Analysis:
1. The program reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases and for each test case, the number of signs and their respective intervals.
2. For each test case, it initializes the year of the first sign's occurrence as `a[0]`.
3. It then iterates through the remaining signs, calculating the year of their occurrence based on the year the previous sign occurred.
4. For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. This formula finds the next multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
5. The program stores the result for each test case and prints them all at the end.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the code with the first test case from the example:
- For the first test case: `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - First sign: `3`
  - Second sign: `(3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4` (first multiple of 2 after 3)
  - Third sign: `(4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8` (first multiple of 4 after 4)
  - Fourth sign: `(8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10` (first multiple of 5 after 8)
  - Fifth sign: `(10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18` (first multiple of 9 after 10)
  - Sixth sign: `(18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36` (first multiple of 18 after 18)
- The result for this test case is `36`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen, according to the problem statement and the example provided.

Correctness: **True**
