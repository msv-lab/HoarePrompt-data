Output State: **`b` is a list of integers provided by the input; `a` is an input integer and must be greater than 2; the output is 'YES'; the current element `b[i]` is less than 0; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `b`, `a`, and the output remain unchanged. The only impact is that the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
