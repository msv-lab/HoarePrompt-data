The code snippet `b[i] -= b[i]` effectively sets `b[i]` to 0 because subtracting a value from itself results in zero. 

The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged unless `b[i]` was involved in them, which it wasn't in the conditions or the other assignments provided. Therefore, the value of `i` being `i + 1`, the condition regarding `b[i]` being less than 0, and the calculations for `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1`. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - b[i] * 2`. `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`. `b[i]` is 0.**
