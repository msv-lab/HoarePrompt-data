The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the condition `a - 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. To continue the loop, `i` must be incremented by 1 again to reflect the start of the next iteration. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `a - 2`.

Given that `i` was incremented to `i + 1` at the end of the last iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 2`**.
