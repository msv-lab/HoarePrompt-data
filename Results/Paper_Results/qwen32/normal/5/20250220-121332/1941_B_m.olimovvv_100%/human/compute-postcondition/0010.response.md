The code snippet `b[i] -= b[i]` effectively sets `b[i]` to 0 because subtracting a value from itself results in 0. The other parts of the initial state, such as `t`, `a`, and the updates to `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]`, are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is updated to `b[i + 2] - b[i]`**.
