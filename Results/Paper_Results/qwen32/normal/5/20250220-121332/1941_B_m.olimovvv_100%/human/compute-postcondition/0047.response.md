Postcondition: **`b` is a list of integers where `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * 0`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2]`; `a` is an input integer and must be greater than 7; the output is 'YES'; `i` is 5. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.**
