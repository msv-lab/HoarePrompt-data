Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The main issue is that the program incorrectly modifies the array elements in a way that does not align with the allowed operation. Specifically, the operation defined in the problem can only be applied to indices \(i\) such that \(2 \le i \le n - 1\), and it modifies \(a_{i-1}\), \(a_i\), and \(a_{i+1}\) by subtracting 1, 2, and 1 respectively. The provided code, however, iterates over the array starting from index 0 and incorrectly applies the operation in a way that does not preserve the original constraints.

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Correct Operation:**
- Start with the array: `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`
- Apply the operation at \(i = 2\): `[0, 2, 3, 3, 2]`
- Apply the operation at \(i = 3\): `[0, 1, 1, 1, 2]`
- Apply the operation at \(i = 2\): `[0, 0, -1, 2, 2]` (Invalid, as it results in a negative number)

However, the provided code will incorrectly attempt to apply the operation starting from index 0, leading to invalid modifications.

**Incorrect Modification in the Code:**
- The code iterates from `i = 0` to `i = a - 3` and modifies the array elements as follows:
  - `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2`
  - `b[i + 2] -= b[i]`
  - `b[i] -= b[i]`

This does not align with the allowed operation and can lead to incorrect results or negative values in the array, which is not allowed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
