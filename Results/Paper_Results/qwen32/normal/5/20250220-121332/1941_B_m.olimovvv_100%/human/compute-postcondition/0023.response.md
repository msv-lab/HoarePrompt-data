The code snippet modifies `b[i + 2]` by subtracting `b[i]` from it. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`, `b[i + 1]`, and the condition for breaking out of the loop) are not affected by this specific line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `a` is greater than 2
- `i` is `i + 2`
- `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`
- If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

The only change in the output state is the value of `b[i + 2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 2`, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
