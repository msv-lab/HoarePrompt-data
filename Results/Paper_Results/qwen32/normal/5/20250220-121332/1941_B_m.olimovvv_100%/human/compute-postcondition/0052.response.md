In the given task, the loop head only contains the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The underscore `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not plan to use. The loop will iterate based on the value of `int(input())`, which is not explicitly mentioned in the state at the end of the previous iteration. However, we can infer that this value is decremented by 1 after each iteration.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration is `YES`, this does not directly affect the loop's iteration count. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is the count derived from `int(input())`.

Let's assume that `int(input())` was `x` at the start of the previous iteration, and since the loop has just finished one iteration, the count is now `x - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the count must be decremented by 1 again, making it `x - 2`.

Since the state `YES` does not influence the loop's iteration count, we will only adjust the count.

State: **YES, int(input()) is `x - 2`** 

However, since we do not have the exact value of `x`, we can only express the state in terms of the previous count. If we denote the count at the start of the previous iteration as `count`, then at the start of the next iteration, the count would be `count - 1`.

State: **YES, int(input()) is `count - 1`** 

Given that we do not have the initial `count`, we can only express the state in this relative form. If we assume `count` was the number of iterations left at the start of the previous iteration, then:

State: **YES, int(input()) is the number of iterations left minus 1** 

But to provide a more concrete example, if we assume that `count` was 5 at the start of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, it would be 4.

State: **YES, int(input()) is 4**

Since we do not have the exact initial count, the most accurate relative form is:

State: **YES, int(input()) is `count - 1`**

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `count` was 5:

State: **YES, int(input()) is 4**
