The code snippet `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` modifies the element at index `i + 2` of the list `b` by subtracting the value of `b[i]` from it. The other variables `a` and the output 'YES' remain unchanged. The precondition that `a` is an input integer greater than 2 and the output is 'YES' is still valid after the code has been executed.

Output State: **`b` is a list of integers where `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]` and `b[i + 2]` is updated to `b[i + 2] - b[i]`; `a` is an input integer and must be greater than 2; the output is 'YES'.**
