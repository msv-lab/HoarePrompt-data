Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

**Initial State:**
- `b` is a list of integers.
- `b[i]` is 0.
- `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, which simplifies to `b[i + 1]` since `b[i]` is 0.
- `b[i + 2]` is updated to `b[i + 2] - b[i]`, which simplifies to `b[i + 2]` since `b[i]` is 0.
- `a` is an input integer and must be greater than 6.
- The output is 'YES'.
- `i` is 4.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print('NO')
```

**Analysis:**
The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about the variables and the list `b`, but none of this information affects the `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'NO'`, regardless of the values of `b`, `a`, or `i`.

**Output:**
Output: **NO**
