The code snippet modifies the value of `b[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from it. The values of `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged unless the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, which depends on the value of `b[i]`. Since the problem specifies that if `b[i]` is less than 0, the loop or if statement is broken out of, we need to consider this condition.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is greater than 2.
- `i` is `i + 2`.
- If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

The code modifies `b[i + 1]` to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 2`, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
