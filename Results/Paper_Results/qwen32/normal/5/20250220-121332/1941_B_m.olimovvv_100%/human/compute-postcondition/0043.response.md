The code snippet `b[i] -= b[i]` effectively sets `b[i]` to 0 because any number minus itself is 0. Given that `i` is 4, `b[4]` is set to 0. The other elements of the list `b` and the other variables `a` and the output are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`b` is a list of integers where `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * 0`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2]`; `a` is an input integer and must be greater than 6; the output is 'YES'; `i` is 4.**
