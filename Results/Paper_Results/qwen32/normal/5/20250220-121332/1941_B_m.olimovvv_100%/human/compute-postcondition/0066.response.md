Postcondition: **`a` is greater than 3, `b` is a list of integers where `b[0]` is 0, `b[1]` has been updated to `b[1] - 2 * b[0]`, and `b[2]` has been updated to `b[2] - b[0]`. If `b[i]` (which is `b[1]` since `i` is 1) is less than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking. `i` remains 1.**
