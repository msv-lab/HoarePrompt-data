The code snippet `a = int(input())` assigns the value of `a` to the integer value of the input provided by the user. The initial state of the array `b` and the output 'YES' are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is the value of `a` which is now set to the user's input.

Output State: **All elements from `b[0]` to `b[a-3]` are zero, `b[a-2]` is 0, `b[a-1]` is 0, and the output is 'YES'; `a` is an input integer.**
