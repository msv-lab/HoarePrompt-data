Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully implement the problem description. It only includes two functions that handle movement and elimination by the Bludger, but it does not handle the core logic of the game such as scoring goals, catching and throwing the Quaffle, or keeping track of the score. Additionally, the program does not process the entire input, including the field setup and the sequence of actions.

Here are some specific issues:
1. The program does not handle the initial setup of the field, including the positions of players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.
2. There is no logic to handle the actions of catching and throwing the Quaffle.
3. The program does not keep track of the score.
4. The program does not handle the case where a player scores a goal in their own goal.
5. The program does not handle the case where the Quaffle needs to be reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and thus is incorrect.
