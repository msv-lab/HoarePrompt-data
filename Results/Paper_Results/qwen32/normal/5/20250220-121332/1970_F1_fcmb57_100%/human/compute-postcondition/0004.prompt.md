You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field, where 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd. b is a list of strings representing the field, where each string is a row of M pairs of characters separated by spaces, and M is the number of columns in the field, where 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd. The list b has N elements. The next input is an integer T representing the number of steps in the game, where 0 <= T <= 10000. Following T lines are the actions performed by entities in the field, where each action is a string containing a pair of characters followed by a space and a valid action (U, D, L, R, C, or T) and possibly additional information for catch and throw actions.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns the result of `x + int(dx), y + int(dy)`, where `x` and `y` are integers, and `dx` and `dy` are the first and second strings in the list `b` respectively, converted to integers.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `a` representing the number of lines in the field, a list of strings `b` representing the field, and an integer `T` representing the number of steps in the game. It processes a series of actions performed by entities in the field and returns the result of `x + int(dx), y + int(dy)`, where `x` and `y` are integers, and `dx` and `dy` are the first and second strings in the list `b` respectively, converted to integers.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the result of `x + int(dx), y + int(dy)`, where `x` and `y` are integers, and `dx` and `dy` are the first and second strings in the list `b` respectively, converted to integers.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
