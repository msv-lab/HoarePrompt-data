Reasoning:  
The provided Python program has a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure it is correct according to the problem description and execution summary.

1. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is used to update the player's position based on the movement. However, it is called inside the loop that processes the moves, but the function is defined after the loop. In Python, functions need to be defined before they are called.

2. **Quaffle Handling**: The program does not handle the Quaffle's position correctly. The Quaffle should be moved to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, but the program does not update its position.

3. **Goal Scoring Logic**: The program correctly checks if the player is at a goal position after throwing the Quaffle, but it does not handle the scenario where the player scores in their own goal.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the score at the end, but it does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal correctly.

5. **Execution Summary Misinterpretation**: The execution summary provided is incorrect for the function `func_1`. The summary describes the function as taking an integer and a list, but the function actually takes a tuple and another tuple.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)

(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
quaffle_pos = None

for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quaffle_pos = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        if mo[0] in players and players[mo[0]] == quaffle_pos:
            players[mo[0]] = (players[mo[0]][0], players[mo[0]][1])
            quaffle_pos = players[mo[0]]
    elif mo[1] == 'C' and players[mo[0]] == quaffle_pos:
        quaffle_pos = None
    elif mo[1] == 'T' and quaffle_pos is not None:
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            if mo[0][0] == 'B':
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            else:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
        elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            else:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
        quaffle_pos = ((m+1)//2 - 1, (n+1)//2 - 1)

print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

Given the issues identified, the original program is not correct. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
