### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program correctly initializes the field dimensions `n` and `m`.
   - It sets up dictionaries to keep track of player positions and goal positions.
   - It also initializes the score counters for both teams.

2. **Field Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the field to identify player positions, goal positions, and the Quaffle position.
   - It skips empty cells (`..`) and the Quaffle (`Q`).

3. **Movement Handling**:
   - The program defines a dictionary `mouvements` to map movement commands (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`) to their respective coordinate changes.
   - The function `func_1` correctly updates the player's position based on the movement command.

4. **Action Parsing and Execution**:
   - The program reads the number of actions `moves` and processes each action in a loop.
   - For movement actions (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), it updates the player's position using `func_1`.
   - For throw actions (`T`), it checks if the player is at a goal of the opposing team and updates the score accordingly. It prints the goal event with the correct team name and the current action index.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all actions, the program prints the final score in the required format.

### Issues:
- The program does not handle the `C` (catch) action, which is part of the problem description. However, the problem states that "All the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid," and "don't catch a ball if they are not in the same cell," so this might be a simplification or an assumption in the problem constraints.
- The program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal. The problem description requires the other team to win the point in this case, but the current implementation does not handle it.

### Conclusion:
Given the provided examples and the assumption that the `C` action is not necessary to be handled based on the problem constraints, the program seems to correctly implement the described behavior. However, the issue with scoring in the wrong goal should be addressed.

### Correctness:
**False** (due to the issue with scoring in the wrong goal)

However, if we assume that the problem constraints ensure that players do not score in their own goal, the program could be considered correct for the given examples. But strictly based on the problem description, the program is **False**. 

Correctness: **False**
