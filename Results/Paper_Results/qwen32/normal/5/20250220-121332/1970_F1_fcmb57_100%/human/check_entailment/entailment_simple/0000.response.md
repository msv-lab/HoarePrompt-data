### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field (`N` and `M`).
   - It then reads the field description into a list of strings (`s`), where each string represents a row of the field.
   - It initializes dictionaries to keep track of player positions (`players`), goal positions for each team (`goals`), and movement directions (`mouvements`).
   - The program also initializes the scores for the red and blue teams (`pointsr` and `pointsb`).

2. **Field Parsing:**
   - The program iterates over the field rows and columns to populate the `players` dictionary and `goals` list based on the field description.
   - It correctly identifies and records the positions of players and goals.

3. **Processing Moves:**
   - The program reads the number of moves (`moves`) and then processes each move.
   - For movement actions (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), it updates the player's position using the `func_1` function, which correctly calculates the new position based on the movement direction.
   - For throwing actions (`T`), the program checks if the player is at a goal position to determine if a point should be scored. It correctly updates the scores and prints the appropriate goal message.

4. **Goal Scoring:**
   - When a player throws the Quaffle (`T`), the program checks if the player is at a goal position.
   - If the player is at a red goal (`RG`), it increments the blue team's score (`pointsb`) and prints `BLUE GOAL`.
   - If the player is at a blue goal (`BG`), it increments the red team's score (`pointsr`) and prints `RED GOAL`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - After processing all moves, the program prints the final scores in the required format.

### Issues Identified:
- The program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal. According to the problem description, if a player scores in their own goal, the other team should win the point. The current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly.
- The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the provided code snippet. It should be used to update player positions correctly, but the program already uses it appropriately.

### Correctness:
Given the identified issue with scoring in the wrong goal, the program is not entirely correct as per the problem description. It needs to handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal.

**Correctness: False**

### Revised Program:
To fix the issue, we need to add a check to determine if the player is scoring in their own goal and update the scores accordingly.

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..' or s[x] == '.Q':
            continue
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        pos = players[mo[0]]
        team = mo[0][0]
        if pos in goals['R']:
            if team == 'B':
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            else:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
        if pos in goals['B']:
            if team == 'R':
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            else:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
```

This revised program correctly handles the scenario where a player scores in their own goal.
