Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `2 * math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; if `cnt` is 2, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; otherwise, `res` remains 0. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.**

Note: It seems there might be a mistake in the if part's postcondition as it suggests adding `math.comb(cnt, 3)` twice. I have corrected it by adding `2 * math.comb(cnt, 3)` in the overall postcondition to reflect the intended logic.
