The only variable in the loop head is `x`, and it iterates over the elements of the list `nums`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `x` and how it relates to the elements in `nums`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value incremented by 1.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` has taken on the value of the current element from `nums`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be set to the next element in `nums`.

Let's denote the current index of `x` in `nums` as `current_index`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was `nums[current_index]`. For the next iteration, `x` should be `nums[current_index + 1]`.

Since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head, we focus on `x` and implicitly understand that `nums` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value incremented by 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in `nums` after the current one**.

To be more specific, if `x` was `nums[i]` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be `nums[i + 1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value incremented by 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `x` is `nums[i + 1]` where `i` is the index of `x` in `nums` from the previous iteration**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i`, we can represent the state as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value incremented by 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in `nums`**.
