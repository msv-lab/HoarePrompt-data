The provided code snippet is:
```
num_of_lens = {}
```

This line of code reinitializes the `num_of_lens` dictionary, making it an empty dictionary. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`, and `res`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is the accumulated sum of combinations based on the counts in `num_of_lens`.**
