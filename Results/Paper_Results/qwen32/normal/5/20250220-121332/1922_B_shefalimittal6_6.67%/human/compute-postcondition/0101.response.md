Postcondition: **`t` is `n - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one unique element, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` after `next_cnt`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the value equal to `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is initially calculated based on `next_cnt` and `total_sum` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` remains initially calculated based on `next_cnt` and `total_sum`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.**
