To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `res` is the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for all `cnt` ≥ 3 and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for all `cnt` ≥ 2, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `nums`.
   - For each element `x`, it increments the count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`.
   - The value of `t` is not explicitly updated within the loop, but the loop iterates over all elements in `nums`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop has executed all its iterations, `num_of_lens` will contain the count of each unique integer in `nums`.
   - `t` will still be in its initial state, as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `n`, `nums`, and `res` remain unchanged in terms of their values as per the loop's body.

However, the description of `res` in the initial state and the output states after each iteration is incorrect because `res` is not being updated within the loop. The value of `res` is dependent on the final state of `num_of_lens` and is not computed within the loop provided. 

Given the provided loop, the computation of `res` is not part of the loop's body, so `res` will remain as it was initially defined, which seems to be a placeholder or a precomputed value.

**Output State**: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `nums` and its value is the count of that integer in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for all `cnt` ≥ 3 and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for all `cnt` ≥ 2, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `num_of_lens` will have the count of each unique number in `nums`, and `res` will still be as initially defined, not updated by the loop.
