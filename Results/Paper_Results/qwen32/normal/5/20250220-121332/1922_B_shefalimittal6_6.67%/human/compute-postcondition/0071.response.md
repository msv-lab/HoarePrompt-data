The given code snippet only contains the initialization of an empty dictionary `num_of_lens`. This operation does not affect any other variables provided in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is the sum of math.comb(cnt, 3) for all cnt ≥ 3 and math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum for all cnt ≥ 2, where total_sum is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals cnt.**
