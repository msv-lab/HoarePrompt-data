The code snippet `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` calculates the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items and adds this value to `res`. Given that `cnt` is an integer with a value of at least 3, the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` can be calculated directly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)`; `cnt` is an integer with a value of at least 3.**

In natural language: The value of `res` is updated to be the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items. All other variables remain unchanged.
