The code snippet `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` modifies the value of `res` by adding `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `cnt`, and `total_sum` remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `res`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum + math.comb(cnt, 3)`; if `cnt` is 2, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum + math.comb(cnt, 3)`; otherwise, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.**
