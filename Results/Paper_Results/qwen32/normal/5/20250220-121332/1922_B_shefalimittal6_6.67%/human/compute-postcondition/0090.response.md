The only object in the loop head is the variable `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next value that `cnt` will take from `num_of_lens.values()`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is `n - 1`
- `n` is the input integer
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair
- `nums` is a list of integers with at least one unique element
- `res` is calculated based on the value of `cnt` and `total_sum`
- `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the value equal to `cnt`

Since `cnt` iterates over `num_of_lens.values()`, we need to identify the next value in the sequence of values that `cnt` will take. Assuming the dictionary `num_of_lens` has multiple values, the next value for `cnt` would be the subsequent value in the iteration order of `num_of_lens.values()`.

Let's denote the next value that `cnt` will take as `next_cnt`. The state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is `n - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one unique element, `cnt` is `next_cnt`, `res` is calculated based on the value of `next_cnt` and `total_sum`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the value equal to `next_cnt`**

Since we don't have the specific values of `num_of_lens`, we can't determine the exact value of `next_cnt`, but the state at the start of the next iteration will be as described above with `cnt` taking the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`.
