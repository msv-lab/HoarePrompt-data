The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, and `res`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `nums` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is the accumulated sum of combinations based on the counts in `num_of_lens`.**
