The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Therefore, we need to adjust `cnt` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is `n - 1`
- `n` is the input integer
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair
- `nums` is a list of integers with at least one unique element
- `cnt` is `next_cnt`
- `res` is initially calculated based on `next_cnt` and `total_sum`
- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`
- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is further increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`
- `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the value equal to `next_cnt`

Since `cnt` is currently `next_cnt` and the loop iterates over the values of `num_of_lens`, for the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` should be the next value in the iteration sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`.

Assuming `num_of_lens.values()` is a list of values `[v1, v2, ..., vk]` and `next_cnt` was `v1`, then for the next iteration, `cnt` should be `v2`.

State: **`t` is `n - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one unique element, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` after `next_cnt`, `res` is initially calculated based on `next_cnt` and `total_sum`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the value equal to `next_cnt`**
