The code calculates the sum of all values in the `num_of_lens` dictionary except for the value that is equal to `cnt`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `cnt`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `n - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least one unique element, the current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the value equal to `cnt`.**
