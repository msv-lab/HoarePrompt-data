Postcondition: **`t` is `n - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one unique element, `cnt` is `next_cnt`, `res` is calculated based on the value of `next_cnt` and `total_sum`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is further increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the value equal to `next_cnt`.**
