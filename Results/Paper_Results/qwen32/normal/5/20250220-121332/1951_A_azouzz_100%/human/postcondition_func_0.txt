The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s`. It then determines if the number of '1's in the string `s` meets certain conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on those conditions. The final state of the program is that it has processed all test cases and printed the corresponding 'YES' or 'NO' for each.
