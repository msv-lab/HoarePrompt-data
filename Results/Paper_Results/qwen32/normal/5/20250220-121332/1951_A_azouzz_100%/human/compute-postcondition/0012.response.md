Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state provided:

Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is the value of the user input.
- `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. The current value of `cnt1` is 1.

The code snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `cnt1`. It simply prints the string 'NO'.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **NO**
