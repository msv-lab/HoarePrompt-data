Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is `t + 1`; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is the new value of the user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. Whether '11' is in `s` or not, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged.**
