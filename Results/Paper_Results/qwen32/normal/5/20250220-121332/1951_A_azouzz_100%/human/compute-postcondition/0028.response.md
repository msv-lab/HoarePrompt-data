To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start <= end`.
   - `t` is `t - 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is the new value of the user input.
   - `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`.
   - The conditions for `cnt1`:
     - If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the program follows the if part.
     - Otherwise, `cnt1` is either 0, 2, or an odd number.
     - If `s` contains the substring '11', then `cnt1` is either 2 or an odd number greater than 2.
     - If `s` does not contain the substring '11', then `cnt1` is either 0 or 2 or an odd number greater than 2.
   
2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

### Analysis:
- The provided `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
- Regardless of the value of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `cnt1`, the `print` statement will always output the string `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print('NO')` statement will print the string `'NO'` without considering the values of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **NO**
