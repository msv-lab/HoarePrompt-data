The given `print` statement is `print('NO')`. This statement explicitly prints the string 'NO' and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state describes several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`), but none of them are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string 'NO'.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
