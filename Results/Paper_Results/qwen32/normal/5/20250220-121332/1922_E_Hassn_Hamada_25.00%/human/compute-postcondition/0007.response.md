To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```
while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` is true.

Let's break down the condition:
- `(1 << size + 1)` is a bitwise left shift operation, which is equivalent to \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)}\).
- Subtracting 1 from this value gives us \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)} - 1\).

Given the current state:
- `number` must be at least 3.
- `size` is 2.

First, let's compute the value of the condition with the current `size`:
- When `size` is 2, \(2^{(2 + 1)} - 1 = 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7\).

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` must be true. With `size` being 2, the condition becomes `7 <= number`.

Since `number` must be at least 3, we need to ensure that `number` is at least 7 to satisfy the condition for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted so that `number` is at least 7.

State: **`number` must be at least 7, `size` is 2**
