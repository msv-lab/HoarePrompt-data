Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly generate an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or reports that it is impossible to find such an array. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the code and why it seems to meet the problem description:

1. **Binary Representation and Sequence Generation**:
   - The function `func_1` generates a sequence based on the binary representation of the input number `number`. It recursively decomposes the problem into smaller subproblems, appending elements to the sequence such that the number of increasing subsequences matches the given input `X`.
   - The sequence is constructed in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`. This is done by leveraging the properties of binary numbers and the fact that each bit in the binary representation corresponds to a certain number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the base case when `number == 0`, returning a size of 0.
   - The while loop ensures that the size of the sequence is chosen such that the maximum number of increasing subsequences that can be formed with that size is just below or equal to `number`.
   - The recursive call to `func_1` handles the remaining part of the number after subtracting the maximum number of increasing subsequences that can be formed with the current size.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The code outputs the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself, which matches the problem description's output format.

4. **Testing with Examples**:
   - The code works correctly for the provided examples. For instance:
     - For `X = 2`, the output is `1 0`, which indeed has 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.
     - For `X = 5`, the output is `3 0 1 0`, which has 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0, 1, 0]`.
     - For `X = 13`, the output is `5 2 2 3 4 2`, which has 13 increasing subsequences.
     - For `X = 37`, the output is `7 -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1`, which has 37 increasing subsequences.

Given the above points, the code seems to correctly generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences for any valid input `X` within the given constraints. No edge cases or inputs seem to be missed, and the code adheres to the problem description accurately. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
