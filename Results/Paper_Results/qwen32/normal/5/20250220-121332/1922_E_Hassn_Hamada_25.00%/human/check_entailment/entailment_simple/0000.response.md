Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to generate an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, where `X` is given as input. The function `func_1` is supposed to construct the sequence based on the input number `X` (adjusted by subtracting 1). 

However, there are several issues with the program that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Sequence Construction**: The logic inside `func_1` does not correctly generate the required sequence. The program uses a binary representation approach to try to construct the sequence, but it doesn't ensure that the sequence has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if `X` is a power of 2, the program might not generate a valid sequence.

3. **Lack of Explanation for Correctness**: The provided comments and the function's docstring do not provide a clear explanation of why the generated sequence should have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic within `func_1` is not well-explained or justified.

4. **Incorrect State Transitions**: The state transitions described in the comments are not accurate. For example, the state where `size` is 9 and the sequence contains `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` is not necessarily the correct state for all values of `X`.

5. **Potential Infinite Loop**: The while loop condition `1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` could potentially lead to an infinite loop if not handled correctly, although this is less likely given the constraints.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
