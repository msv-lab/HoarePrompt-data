The code modifies the element at a specific index in the `sequence` list by adding the value of `result` to it. The index is determined by `-result - i - 1`. Given that `i` is 1, the index becomes `-result - 2`. The value of `size` remains unchanged as it is not directly involved in the operation. The value of `i` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`size` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `sequence[-result - 2]` is increased by `result`.**
