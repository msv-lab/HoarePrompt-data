Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` is intended to generate a sequence that corresponds to the number of increasing subsequences, but the logic to achieve this is flawed. The function does not correctly calculate the sequence to ensure the exact number of increasing subsequences as required.

2. **Handling Large Numbers**: The problem requires handling up to \(10^{18}\) increasing subsequences, which the current implementation does not handle correctly. The logic for splitting the number into a sequence of increasing subsequences does not work for such large values.

3. **Output Format**: The program is supposed to output `-1` if it's impossible to find such an array, but the current implementation does not check for impossibility and always attempts to generate a sequence.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided example outputs are not correctly generated by the program. For instance, the array `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` for the input `5` does not have exactly 5 increasing subsequences.

To solve this problem correctly, a different approach is needed. One possible method is to use the binary representation of the number of increasing subsequences to construct the array. However, the current implementation does not follow this approach and does not correctly solve the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.
