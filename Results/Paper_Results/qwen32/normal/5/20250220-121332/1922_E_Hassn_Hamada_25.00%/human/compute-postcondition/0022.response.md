The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `size`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `size`. If `i` is less than `size`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `size` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `size` should remain greater than 0, and since no information indicates any change to `size` in the loop body, we can keep it as `size` must be greater than 0.

The state of the element at index `-result - 1` in `sequence` being incremented by `result` is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted here.

State: **`size` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
