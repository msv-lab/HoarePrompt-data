You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Function Summary: 
The function generates a sequence of numbers based on the input `number` and modifies the `sequence` list by appending and adjusting its values. It returns the size of the generated sequence, which is either 0 if `number` is 0, or a value calculated as `size + result` where `size` is determined by the binary representation of `number` and `result` is the result of a recursive call.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The problem requires generating an array of integers such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences. The provided program attempts to solve this by constructing the array based on a recursive function `func_1`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads a single integer `X`.

2. **Recursive Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will result in exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - It calculates the size of the sequence by finding the largest `size` such that `(1 << (size + 1)) - 1` (which is `2^(size+1) - 1`) is less than or equal to `number`.
   - It appends integers from `0` to `size-1` to the sequence.
   - It then recursively processes the remaining number by subtracting `(1 << size) - 1` from `number`.
   - After the recursive call, it modifies the sequence by adding the result of the recursive call to the last `size` elements of the sequence.

3. **Output**:
   - The length of the generated sequence is printed.
   - The sequence itself is printed as space-separated integers.

### Analysis:

The key idea behind the program is to use a binary representation and a recursive approach to generate the sequence. The function `func_1` seems to be trying to construct a sequence that results in the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by `X`.

However, there are a few concerns:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm**: The algorithm seems to be based on the idea of using binary representation to construct the sequence. However, the exact logic of how this binary representation translates to the exact number of increasing subsequences is not immediately clear from the code alone.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases explicitly, such as when `X` is very large (close to `10^18`) or when `X` is a power of 2 minus 1.
- **Output Constraints**: The program ensures that the length of the sequence is at most 200, but it does not explicitly check if the generated sequence meets the criteria of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:

While the program seems to follow a logical approach and handles multiple test cases, the correctness of the algorithm is not immediately apparent without a detailed mathematical proof of the relationship between the binary representation and the number of increasing subsequences.

Given the complexity and the lack of explicit verification in the code, it's safer to assume that the program might not handle all edge cases correctly.

**Correctness: False**

The program might produce correct results for many test cases, but without a rigorous proof, we cannot guarantee its correctness for all possible values of `X` within the given constraints.
