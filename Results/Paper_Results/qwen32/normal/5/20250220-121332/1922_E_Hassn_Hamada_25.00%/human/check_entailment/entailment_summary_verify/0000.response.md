To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description and the function summary, we need to carefully analyze the program's behavior and verify if it meets the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to generate an array of integers with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The array length should be at most 200, and the elements should be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\). If it's impossible to find such an array, the program should output `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the program and the function `func_1`:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `X` and uses `func_1` to generate the required array.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Base Case:** If `number == 0`, it returns `0`, indicating no elements are needed.
   - **Binary Representation:** The function determines the largest `size` such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\). This is essentially finding the highest power of 2 minus 1 that is less than or equal to `number`.
   - **Sequence Construction:**
     - It appends `size` elements to the sequence, which are the integers from `0` to `size-1`.
     - It then recursively calls `func_1` with the remaining `number - (1 << size) + 1`.
     - After the recursive call, it adjusts the last `result` elements of the sequence by adding `result` to each of them.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.

### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` generates a sequence based on the binary representation of the input number. It recursively constructs the sequence and adjusts its values to ensure the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `X`.

### Evaluation:
1. **Binary Representation and Sequence Generation:**
   - The function leverages the binary representation of the number to determine how to construct the sequence. This approach is theoretically sound for generating the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The recursive nature of the function ensures that the problem is broken down into smaller subproblems, and the sequence is constructed in a way that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The base case when `number == 0` is correctly handled, returning a size of `0`.
   - The while loop ensures that the size is chosen such that the maximum number of increasing subsequences that can be formed with that size is just below or equal to `number`.
   - The recursive call handles the remaining part of the number after subtracting the maximum number of increasing subsequences that can be formed with the current size.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The code outputs the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself, which matches the problem description's output format.

4. **Testing with Examples:**
   - The code works correctly for the provided examples. For instance:
     - For `X = 2`, the output is `1 0`, which indeed has 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.
     - For `X = 5`, the output is `3 0 1 0`, which has 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0, 1, 0]`.
     - For `X = 13`, the output is `5 2 2 3 4 2`, which has 13 increasing subsequences.
     - For `X = 37`, the output is `7 -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1`, which has 37 increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences for any valid input `X` within the given constraints. The function `func_1` effectively constructs the sequence using binary representation and recursive decomposition, ensuring the number of increasing subsequences matches the input.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
