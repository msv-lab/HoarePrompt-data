The code snippet `sequence.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the `sequence` list. Given that `i` is initialized to 0, the value 0 will be added to the `sequence` list. The values of `size` and the condition that `size` must be greater than 0 remain unchanged.

Output State: **`size` is 9, `i` is 0, `sequence` contains [0]**
