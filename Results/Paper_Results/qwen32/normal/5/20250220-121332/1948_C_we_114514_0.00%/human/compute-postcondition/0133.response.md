The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Since `n` is 2, the loop will not execute again after `j` becomes 2.

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is either True or False, `reachable_second_row` remains True if it was True before the if statement, and `results` is ['NO']. `j` is 2**
