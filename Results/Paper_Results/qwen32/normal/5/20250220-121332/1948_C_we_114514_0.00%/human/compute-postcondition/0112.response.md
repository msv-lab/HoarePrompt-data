Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False, and `results` is ['NO']**

Explanation: The value of `reachable_second_row` has been changed to `False`, and as a result, `results` is updated to `['NO']`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
