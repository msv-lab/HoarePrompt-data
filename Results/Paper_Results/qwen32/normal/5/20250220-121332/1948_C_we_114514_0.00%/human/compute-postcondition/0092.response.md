The code snippet sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 3, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is True if `j` is 2 and `row1[j]` is not '>', otherwise `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is 3**. 

In natural language: The value of `reachable_second_row` has been set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values.
