Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is ['NO'], `j` is 2. If `j == n - 1`, the state of `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged regardless of its initial value and the values of `row1[j]` and `row2[j]`. If `j` is not equal to `n - 1`, the state of `reachable_first_row` is determined by the conditions specified in the precondition: it remains True or False based on the value of `row1[j]` and potentially `row2[j]` if `row1[j]` is not '>' and `j` is less than `n - 1`. If `row2[j] == '>'` and `j` is not equal to `n - 1`, the state of `reachable_first_row` is determined as specified, but no additional changes are made to `reachable_first_row` by the `if` block.**
