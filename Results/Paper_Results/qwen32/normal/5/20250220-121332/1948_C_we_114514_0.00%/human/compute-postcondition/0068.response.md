Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 3, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, and `row1[j]` is not equal to '>'. Additionally, `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is equal to '>'**

Natural Language: The value of `reachable_second_row` has been changed to `True`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
