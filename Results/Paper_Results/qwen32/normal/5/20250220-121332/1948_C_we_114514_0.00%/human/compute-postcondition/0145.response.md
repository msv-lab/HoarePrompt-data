The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is 2. Since `j` is not less than `n`, the loop would not execute again. However, if we want to adjust the state to make the loop execute one more time, we need to decrease `j` to be less than `n`.

Given the provided state, `j` should be adjusted to 1 (the next value in the range) to allow the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `results` is ['NO'], `j` is 1**
