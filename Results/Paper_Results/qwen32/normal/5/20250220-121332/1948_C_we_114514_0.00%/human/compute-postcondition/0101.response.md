Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 3, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `j` is 3. If `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` is equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged based on the initial conditions provided. If `row2[j]` is not '>', the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.**
