The code appends the string `'NO'` to the `results` list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the `results` list, which initially contained `['NO']`, will now contain `['NO', 'NO']`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is False, and `results` is ['NO', 'NO'].**
