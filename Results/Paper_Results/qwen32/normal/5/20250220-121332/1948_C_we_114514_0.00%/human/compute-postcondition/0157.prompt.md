Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False, and `results` is ['NO']
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is either True or False, `reachable_second_row` remains True if it was True before the if statement, and `results` is ['NO']. There is no change in the state of the variables if `reachable_second_row` is False. If `reachable_second_row` is True and `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` remains True. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `results` is ['NO'], `j` is 2. If `reachable_second_row` is True, the state of `reachable_first_row` is determined based on the conditions specified in the precondition: it remains True or False based on the value of `row1[j]` and potentially `row2[j]` if `row1[j]` is not '>' and `j` is less than `n - 1`. If `j` equals `n - 1`, the state of `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is False, the state of `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged regardless of the values of `row1[j]` and `row2[j]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `results` is ['NO'], `j` is 1. If `reachable_second_row` is True, and `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` remains True. If `reachable_second_row` is True and `row2[j]` is not '>', then `reachable_second_row` remains True. If `reachable_second_row` is False, it remains False. If `row1[j]` is not '>', `reachable_first_row` is set to False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
