Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", and `results` is ['NO']. If `j` is equal to `n - 1`, then `reachable_first_row` is True and `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` remains True and `reachable_second_row` remains False. Additionally, `row1[j]` is `'>'`.**
