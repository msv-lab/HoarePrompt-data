Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is either `n - 1` or less than `n - 1`, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", and `reachable_second_row` is True. If `j == n - 1`, then `reachable_first_row` remains True. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` can be either True or False depending on the value of `row1[j]`. If `row1[j]` was '>', `reachable_first_row` remains True; otherwise, `reachable_first_row` becomes False.**
