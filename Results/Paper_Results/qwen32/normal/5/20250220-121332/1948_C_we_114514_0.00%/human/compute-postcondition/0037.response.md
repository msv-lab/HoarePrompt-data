The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `j + 1` (where `j` was less than `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration), and `n` is greater than 0.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 2`, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_second_row` is True**.

However, since `j` was `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust it correctly. If `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `k + 1`.

So, if `j` was `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it means `j` was `k` and now it should be `k + 1`. Therefore, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_second_row` is True**.

To make it clear, if `j` was 0 at the start of the previous iteration, it would be 1 at the start of the current iteration. So, we need to increment `j` by 1 from its current value.

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_second_row` is True**.

Since `j` was `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 again to start the next iteration.

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 2`, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_second_row` is True**.

But to be precise, `j` should be `j + 1` from its current value which was `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_second_row` is True**.

Let's correct it:

If `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `k + 1`.

So, if `j` was `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it means `j` was `k` and now it should be `k + 1`. Therefore, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_second_row` is True**.

Since `j` was `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 again to start the next iteration.

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_second_row` is True**.

Let's correct it properly:

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_second_row` is True**.
