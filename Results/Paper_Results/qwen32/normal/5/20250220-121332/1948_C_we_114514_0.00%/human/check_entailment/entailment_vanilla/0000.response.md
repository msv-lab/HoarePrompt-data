Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement step by step to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Understanding:
The robot starts in cell (1, 1) and can move in four directions (left, right, down, or up). However, it always moves in one direction first and then follows the arrow in the cell it lands in. The goal is to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program seems to attempt to solve the problem by iterating through each column of the grid and updating the reachability status of the robot for both rows. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes two boolean variables: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`.
   - `reachable_first_row` is set to `True` because the robot starts at (1, 1).
   - `reachable_second_row` is set to `False` initially.

2. **Iteration through Columns**:
   - For each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`, the program checks the reachability status.
   - If the robot can reach the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
       - If it is the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n)).
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
       - It sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` (since the robot cannot move further to the left in the first row).
       - If it is not the last column and the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
   - If the robot can reach the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
       - If it is the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (which is already true).

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - After iterating through all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

### Issues in the Program:
The main issue with the program is that it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement. Specifically:
- The program does not account for the possibility of the robot moving up or down between the two rows.
- It incorrectly assumes that once the robot can reach the second row, it will always be able to move to the next column in the second row if the arrow points right. However, the robot could be forced to move back to the first row due to left-pointing arrows and then get stuck.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) for all possible configurations of arrows. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
