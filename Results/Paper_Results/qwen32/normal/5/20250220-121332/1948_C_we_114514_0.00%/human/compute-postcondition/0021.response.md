The code snippet provided sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True.**
