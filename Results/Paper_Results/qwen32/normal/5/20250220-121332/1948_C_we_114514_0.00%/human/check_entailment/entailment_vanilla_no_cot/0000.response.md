Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed because it does not properly account for all possible moves and transitions between the two rows.

Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. The program does not consider the possibility of moving up or down when the robot is on the boundary of the grid.
2. The program does not handle the cases where the robot needs to transition between rows based on the arrow directions.
3. The logic for updating `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` is too simplistic and does not consider all possible paths.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the robot's movements more accurately, considering all possible moves and transitions between the two rows. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_reach_end(n, row1, row2):
    # Initialize states for the two rows
    reachable_first_row = [False] * (n + 1)
    reachable_second_row = [False] * (n + 1)
    
    # Start from (1, 1)
    reachable_first_row[1] = True
    
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if reachable_first_row[j]:
            if j < n:
                if row1[j - 1] == '>':
                    reachable_first_row[j + 1] = True
                elif row1[j - 1] == '<':
                    reachable_first_row[j - 1] = True
            if row1[j - 1] == 'v':
                reachable_second_row[j] = True
        
        if reachable_second_row[j]:
            if j < n:
                if row2[j - 1] == '>':
                    reachable_second_row[j + 1] = True
                elif row2[j - 1] == '<':
                    reachable_second_row[j - 1] = True
            if row2[j - 1] == '^':
                reachable_first_row[j] = True
    
    return reachable_second_row[n]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()
    t = int(input[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        row1 = input[index + 1]
        row2 = input[index + 2]
        index += 3
        if can_reach_end(n, row1, row2):
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected version uses dynamic programming to keep track of which cells are reachable in each row. It considers all possible moves (left, right, up, down) and updates the reachable states accordingly.
