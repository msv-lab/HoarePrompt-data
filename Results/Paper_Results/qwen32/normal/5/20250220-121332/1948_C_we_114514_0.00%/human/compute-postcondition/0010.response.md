Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_second_row` is False. If `j` is equal to `n - 1`, then `reachable_first_row` is True and `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` is True and `reachable_second_row` remains False.**
