Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_second_row` is True. If `j` equals `n - 1`, the state of the variables remains as described. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
