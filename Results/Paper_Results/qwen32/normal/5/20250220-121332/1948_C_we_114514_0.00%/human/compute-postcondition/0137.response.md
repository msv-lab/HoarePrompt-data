The code snippet assigns `True` to the variable `reachable_second_row`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is ['NO'], `j` is 2**.
