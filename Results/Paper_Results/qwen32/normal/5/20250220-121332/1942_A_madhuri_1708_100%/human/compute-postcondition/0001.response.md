The code snippet provided splits a string `s` into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state does not specify the value of `s`, but since `s` is expected to be a string containing two space-separated integers, we can infer that after the execution, `n` and `k` will hold these integer values.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and it is not affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the output state will include the specific values of `n` and `k` derived from the string `s`, and `t` will retain its initial value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from the split string `s`, `k` is the second integer from the split string `s`.**
