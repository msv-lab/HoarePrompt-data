Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from the split string `s`, and `k` is the second integer from the split string `s` with `k` being greater than or equal to 2. If `n` is equal to `k`, then no change is made to `n` or `k`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`.**
