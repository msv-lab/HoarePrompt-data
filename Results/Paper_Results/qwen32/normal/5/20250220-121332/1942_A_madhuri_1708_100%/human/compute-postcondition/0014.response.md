The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'-1'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, and `k`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values are irrelevant to the output of the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'-1'`.

Output: **-1**
