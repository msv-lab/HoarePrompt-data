The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'-1'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `s`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly given by the code itself.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
   - `s` is a string that, when split, provides two integers: `n` and `k`.
   - `n` is the first integer from the split string `s`.
   - `k` is the second integer from the split string `s`.
   - `k` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `n` is not equal to `k`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a single `print` statement: `print('-1')`.
   - This statement explicitly outputs the string `'-1'`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - Since the `print` statement directly outputs `'-1'`, the value of `'-1'` is what will be printed, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `s`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **-1**
