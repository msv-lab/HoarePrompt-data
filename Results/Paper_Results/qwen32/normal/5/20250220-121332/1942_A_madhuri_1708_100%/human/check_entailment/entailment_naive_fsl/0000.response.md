Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly as per the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to generate a valid array for cases where `k` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. 

The current implementation only handles two scenarios:
1. When `k >= 2`:
   - If `n == k`, it prints an array of `k` identical elements.
   - Otherwise, it prints `-1`.
2. When `k == 1`, it prints an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

However, when `k == 1` and `n > 1`, the array `[1, 2, ..., n]` is not a valid solution because all its cyclic shifts are sorted. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 1`, the cyclic shifts `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 1]`, and `[3, 1, 2]` are all sorted, which contradicts the requirement that exactly one cyclic shift should be sorted.

A valid solution for `k == 1` and `n > 1` would be an array where exactly one cyclic shift is sorted, and the rest are not. For instance, for `n = 3` and `k = 1`, a valid array could be `[1, 3, 2]`, where only the first cyclic shift `[1, 3, 2]` is sorted, and the others `[3, 2, 1]` and `[2, 1, 3]` are not sorted.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when `k == 1` and `n > 1` properly.
