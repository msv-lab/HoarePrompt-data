Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `s` is the next line from the input file; `n` and `k` are integers derived from splitting `s` and converting the parts to integers. If `n` is equal to `k`, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part. In both cases, the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, and `k` remain as described.**
