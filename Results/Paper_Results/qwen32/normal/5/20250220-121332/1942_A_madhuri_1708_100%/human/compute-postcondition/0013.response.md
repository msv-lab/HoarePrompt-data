To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `s` is the next line from the input file.
- `n` and `k` are integers derived from splitting `s` and converting the parts to integers.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*[k for j in range(k)])
```

### Analysis:
1. **List Comprehension**: The list comprehension `[k for j in range(k)]` generates a list containing the value `k`, repeated `k` times.
   - For example, if `k` is 3, the list comprehension will generate `[3, 3, 3]`.

2. **Unpacking Operator `*`**: The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the list, meaning that each element of the list will be printed as a separate argument to `print`.
   - Continuing the example where `k` is 3, `print(*[3, 3, 3])` would print `3 3 3`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the value `k`, repeated `k` times, separated by spaces.

### Final Output Description:
Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the integer `k` printed `k` times, separated by spaces.

Output: **k k k ... k (where k is repeated k times)**
