The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'-1'`. This output is independent of the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, and `k` as described in the initial state. The `print` statement is executed regardless of whether the condition `k >= 2` is true or false.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3`.
2. The variable `s` is the next line from the input file.
3. The variables `n` and `k` are derived from splitting the string `s` and converting the parts to integers.
4. The code checks if `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and executes different parts of the program based on this condition. However, the `print` statement in question is outside of any conditional branches and will execute regardless of the condition's outcome.

Since the `print` statement is `print('-1')`, it will output the string `'-1'`.

Output: **-1**
