You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = c / 2
        
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer representing the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, and for each of the `n` iterations, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `d` is `c / 2`. The program has printed either `a * b` or `round(a * d)` for each iteration based on the condition `a * b < a * d`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It calculates `d` as half of `c` and prints either `a * b` or the rounded value of `a * d`, depending on whether `a * b` is less than `a * d`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description. There are several issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads `n` (the number of test cases) and then reads `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case. However, the problem description specifies that the first and only line of each test case contains `n`, `a`, and `b`, not `a`, `b`, and `c`. The variable `c` is not defined in the problem description, and it seems like there might be a misunderstanding in the input parsing.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, but `c` is not defined in the problem description. Instead, the program should calculate the cost based on the number of yogurts `n`, the price for one yogurt `a`, and the price for two yogurts `b`.
   - The logic for determining the minimum cost is incorrect. The program should calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price and how many yogurts will be left to buy at the regular price.

3. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for each test case. The output is based on an incorrect understanding of the problem.

Let's correct the logic and provide a working solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price
        pairs = n // 2
        # Calculate the number of yogurts that will be left to buy at the regular price
        singles = n % 2
        # Calculate the total cost
        total_cost = pairs * b + singles * a
        print(total_cost)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program correctly reads the input, calculates the minimum cost for each test case, and prints the result. It handles the problem description correctly by considering the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price and the number of yogurts that will be left to buy at the regular price.
