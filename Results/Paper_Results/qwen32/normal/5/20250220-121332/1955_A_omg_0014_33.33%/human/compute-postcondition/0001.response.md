For the given task, the loop will execute based on the value of `n` in the `range(n)` function. The variable `t` is not directly related to the execution of the for loop, but it is part of the initial state. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is set in a way that the loop can execute. 

The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized automatically when the loop starts, so we don't need to set it before the loop starts.

Given this understanding, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0**
