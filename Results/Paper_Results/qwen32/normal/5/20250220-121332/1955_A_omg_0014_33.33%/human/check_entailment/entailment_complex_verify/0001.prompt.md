You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = c / 2
        
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer representing the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, and for each of the `n` iterations, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `d` is `c / 2`. The program has printed either `a * b` or `round(a * d)` for each iteration based on the condition `a * b < a * d`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It calculates `d` as half of `c` and prints either `a * b` or the rounded value of `a * d`, depending on whether `a * b` is less than `a * d`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts given the following:
- The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price of two yogurts with a promotion is `b` burles.

The goal is to minimize the total cost. To achieve this, we need to decide whether to buy yogurts in pairs (taking advantage of the promotion) or individually.

### Correct Approach
To find the minimum cost:
1. Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts Maxim can buy: `num_pairs = n // 2`.
2. Calculate the cost if Maxim buys all pairs at the promotion price: `cost_pairs = num_pairs * b`.
3. Calculate the number of remaining yogurts (if `n` is odd): `remaining_yogurts = n % 2`.
4. Calculate the cost for the remaining yogurts at the regular price: `cost_remaining = remaining_yogurts * a`.
5. The total minimum cost is the sum of `cost_pairs` and `cost_remaining`.

### Program Analysis
Let's examine the provided program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**: The program expects the input format as `(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())`, but according to the problem, the correct format should be `(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())` where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts with a promotion.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `d = c / 2`, but `c` is not defined in the context of the problem. It seems like an attempt to calculate the cost of one yogurt if bought in pairs, but this is not the correct approach.
3. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic `if a * b < a * d:` is incorrect. The condition should compare the cost of buying pairs versus buying individually.
4. **Output Calculation**: The output calculation is incorrect. It should be based on the total cost of pairs and remaining yogurts, not the incorrect intermediate calculations.

### Correct Implementation
Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        num_pairs = n // 2
        remaining_yogurts = n % 2
        cost_pairs = num_pairs * b
        cost_remaining = remaining_yogurts * a
        total_cost = cost_pairs + cost_remaining
        print(total_cost)

# Call the function to execute
func()
```

### Conclusion
The original program is incorrect due to improper input parsing, incorrect calculations, and incorrect logic. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
