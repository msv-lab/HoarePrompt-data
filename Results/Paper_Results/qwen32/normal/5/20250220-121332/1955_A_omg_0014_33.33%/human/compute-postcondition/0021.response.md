Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer representing the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, and for each of the `n` iterations, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `d` is `c / 2`. The program has printed either `a * b` or `round(a * d)` for each iteration based on the condition `a * b < a * d`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations (`n` times), the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The program will have processed `n` sets of integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, and for each set, it will have calculated `d` as `c / 2`. Depending on whether `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it will have printed either `a * b` or `round(a * d)`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `i` will have completed its range from `0` to `n-1`.
