Correctness: **False**

The given program has several issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. The input parsing is incorrect. The first integer `n` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, there are three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. The program currently reads `a`, `b`, and `c` where `c` is not defined in the problem description and `b` is incorrectly interpreted.

2. The logic to calculate the minimum cost is incorrect. The program attempts to compare `a * b` with `a * d` where `d` is `c / 2`, but `c` is not defined and the comparison logic is flawed.

3. The program should calculate the minimum cost based on the number of yogurts `n`, the price of one yogurt `a`, and the price of two yogurts `b`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the minimum cost
        # Buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price
        pairs = n // 2
        singles = n % 2
        cost = pairs * b + singles * a
        print(cost)

func()
```

### Explanation:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts.
- `pairs` is the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price.
- `singles` is the number of single yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price.
- The total cost is calculated as `pairs * b + singles * a`.
- The result is printed for each test case.
