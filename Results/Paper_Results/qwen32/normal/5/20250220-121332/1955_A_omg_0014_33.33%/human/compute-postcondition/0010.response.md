The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. This changes the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the input, but does not affect the other variables `t`, `n`, `d`, or `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `d` is `c / 2`. If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, then `a * b` is less than `a * d`. Otherwise, `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

In simpler terms: The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the input. All other variables remain unchanged.
