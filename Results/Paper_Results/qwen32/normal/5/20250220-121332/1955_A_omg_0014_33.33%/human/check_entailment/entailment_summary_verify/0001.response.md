### Reasoning

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem, the given program, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap
- **Objective**: Minimize the cost of buying `n` yogurts.
- **Pricing**:
  - One yogurt costs `a` burles.
  - Two yogurts cost `b` burles when bought together.

#### Correct Approach
To find the minimum cost:
1. **Calculate the number of pairs**:
   - `num_pairs = n // 2`
2. **Calculate the cost for pairs**:
   - `cost_pairs = num_pairs * b`
3. **Calculate the number of remaining yogurts**:
   - `remaining_yogurts = n % 2`
4. **Calculate the cost for the remaining yogurts**:
   - `cost_remaining = remaining_yogurts * a`
5. **Total cost**:
   - `total_cost = cost_pairs + cost_remaining`

#### Given Program Analysis
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**:
   - The program expects three integers `(a, b, c)`, but according to the problem, the input format is `(n, a, b)`.
   - `c` is not used in the problem description, and it seems like a mistake.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - `d = c / 2` is not relevant to the problem.
3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The condition `if a * b < a * d:` is incorrect.
   - The logic does not correctly calculate the minimum cost based on pairs and remaining yogurts.

#### Function Summary
- **Summary**: The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It calculates `d` as half of `c` and prints either `a * b` or the rounded value of `a * d`, depending on whether `a * b` is less than `a * d`.
- **Issues**: The summary does not reflect the correct logic for solving the problem.

#### Correct Implementation
Based on the correct approach:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        num_pairs = n // 2
        remaining_yogurts = n % 2
        cost_pairs = num_pairs * b
        cost_remaining = remaining_yogurts * a
        total_cost = cost_pairs + cost_remaining
        print(total_cost)

# Call the function to execute
func()
```

### Conclusion
The original program is incorrect due to improper input parsing, incorrect calculations, and incorrect logic. The function summary also does not accurately describe the intended logic for solving the problem.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect.
