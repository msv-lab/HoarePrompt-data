### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts given:
- The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price of two yogurts with a promotion is `b` burles.

The goal is to minimize the total cost by deciding whether to buy yogurts in pairs (taking advantage of the promotion) or individually.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**: The program expects the input format as `(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())`, but according to the problem, the correct format should be `(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())` where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts with a promotion.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The variable `c` is not defined in the problem context. The program calculates `d = c / 2`, which does not align with the problem requirements.
3. **Incorrect Logic**: The condition `if a * b < a * d:` is incorrect. The condition should compare the cost of buying pairs versus buying individually.
4. **Output Calculation**: The output calculation is incorrect. It should be based on the total cost of pairs and remaining yogurts, not the incorrect intermediate calculations.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
The annotations provided do not align with the program's logic:
- The program calculates `d = c / 2`, but `c` is not defined in the problem context.
- The condition `if a * b < a * d:` is incorrect and does not reflect the problem's requirements.
- The output calculations `print(a * b)` and `print(round(a * d))` are incorrect.

#### Correct Implementation:
Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        num_pairs = n // 2
        remaining_yogurts = n % 2
        cost_pairs = num_pairs * b
        cost_remaining = remaining_yogurts * a
        total_cost = cost_pairs + cost_remaining
        print(total_cost)

# Call the function to execute
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to improper input parsing, incorrect calculations, and incorrect logic. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: False**
