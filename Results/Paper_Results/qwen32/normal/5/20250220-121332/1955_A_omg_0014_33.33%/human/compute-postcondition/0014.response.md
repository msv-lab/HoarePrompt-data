Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `d` is `c / 2`. If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, then `a * b` is less than `a * d`. Otherwise, `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms: **`t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` remains greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are unchanged integers, and `d` is still `c / 2`. If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, the condition holds. Otherwise, `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
