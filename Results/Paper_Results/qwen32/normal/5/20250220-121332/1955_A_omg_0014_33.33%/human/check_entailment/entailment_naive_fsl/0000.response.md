Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description. There are several issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads `n` (the number of test cases) and then reads `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case. However, the problem description specifies that the first and only line of each test case contains `n`, `a`, and `b`, not `a`, `b`, and `c`. The variable `c` is not defined in the problem description, and it seems like there might be a misunderstanding in the input parsing.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, but `c` is not defined in the problem description. Instead, the program should calculate the cost based on the number of yogurts `n`, the price for one yogurt `a`, and the price for two yogurts `b`.
   - The logic for determining the minimum cost is incorrect. The program should calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price and how many yogurts will be left to buy at the regular price.

3. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for each test case. The output is based on an incorrect understanding of the problem.

Let's correct the logic and provide a working solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price
        pairs = n // 2
        # Calculate the number of yogurts that will be left to buy at the regular price
        singles = n % 2
        # Calculate the total cost
        total_cost = pairs * b + singles * a
        print(total_cost)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program correctly reads the input, calculates the minimum cost for each test case, and prints the result. It handles the problem description correctly by considering the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price and the number of yogurts that will be left to buy at the regular price.
