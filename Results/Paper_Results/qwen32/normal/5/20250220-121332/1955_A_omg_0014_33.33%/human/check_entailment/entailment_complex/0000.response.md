Reasoning: The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the logic and see why it is incorrect.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts. There are two ways to buy yogurts:
1. Buy one yogurt for `a` burles.
2. Buy two yogurts for `b` burles.

### Correct Approach:
To minimize the cost, we should:
- Buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible using the promotion (i.e., `b` burles for two yogurts).
- If there is an odd number of yogurts, buy the remaining yogurt at the regular price (`a` burles).

### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**: The program reads `n` first, but `n` is the number of test cases, not the number of yogurts. Inside the loop, it reads three integers `a, b, c`, but `c` should be `n` (the number of yogurts), and `a` and `b` are correctly interpreted as the price of one yogurt and the price of two yogurts, respectively.
   
2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside the loop is incorrect. The program calculates `d` as `c / 2` (which is not used correctly) and then compares `a * b` with `a * d`. This comparison does not make sense in the context of the problem. Instead, it should calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought using the promotion and handle the remaining yogurt if the number of yogurts is odd.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of pairs and the remaining yogurt
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        
        # Calculate the cost
        cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        
        print(cost)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
