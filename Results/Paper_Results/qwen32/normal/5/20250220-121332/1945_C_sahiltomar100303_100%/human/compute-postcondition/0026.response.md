Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is at least 2, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is 1, `leftZero` is 2 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[0]` is not '0', `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 1, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 2 if `s[0]` is not '0' otherwise 1, `trightOne` is 0. If `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are incremented by 1.**
