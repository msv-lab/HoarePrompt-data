Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is a new input integer such that `n > 1`, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `i` is `mid + 1`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 3 and `trightZero` is 2. Otherwise, `rightZero` is 0 and `trightOne` is 2. If `s[i]` is not '0', `rightOne` is the previous value of `rightOne` plus 1.**
