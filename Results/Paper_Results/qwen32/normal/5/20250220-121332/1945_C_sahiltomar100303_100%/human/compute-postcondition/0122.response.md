Given the initial state:
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is 3 and equals `n`.
- `t`, `a`, `n` is 3.
- `s`, `mid` is 1.
- `leftMove` remains unchanged.
- `tleftZero` and `trightZero`, `tleftOne` and `trightOne` depend on the specific values of `s[2]` and `s[3]`.
- `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, which is 2.

We are asked to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(right)`.

From the initial state, we know that `right` is explicitly set to 3. No operations or conditions are mentioned that would change the value of `right` before the print statement is executed.

Therefore, the value of `right` when the `print(right)` statement is executed is 3.

Output: **3**
