Postcondition: **`right` is 8, `n` is 8, `left` is 0, `t` is 2, `a` is 3, `s` is "11001100", `mid` is 4, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `tleftZero` is 4, `rightZero` is 5, `rightOne` is 3, `trightZero` is 3, `trightOne` is 2, `leftOne` is 3, `tleftOne` is 3`. Additionally, `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, which is 4.5, rounded down to 4.**
