Postcondition: **`left` is not 0; `right` is 3 and equals `n`; `t`, `a`, `n` is 3; `s`, `mid` is 1; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `tleftZero` and `trightZero`, `tleftOne` and `trightOne` depend on the specific values of `s[2]` and `s[3]`. If `left` is not 0, the condition `left != 0` is true. If `left` is 0, then `tleftZero` is compared to the threshold (n + 1) // 2, which is 2. If `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to 2, it meets or exceeds the threshold; otherwise, it is less than the threshold.**
