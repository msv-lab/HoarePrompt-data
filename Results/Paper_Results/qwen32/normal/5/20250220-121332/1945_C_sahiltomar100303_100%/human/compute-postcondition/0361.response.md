The code increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Given the initial state, `tleftZero` was 2. After the increment, `tleftZero` becomes 3. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is 5, `t` is 2, `a` is 3, `n` is 8, `s` is "11001100", `mid` is 4, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 5, `rightOne` is 3, `tleftZero` is 3, `trightZero` is 1, `tleftOne` is 3, `trightOne` is 2`.**
