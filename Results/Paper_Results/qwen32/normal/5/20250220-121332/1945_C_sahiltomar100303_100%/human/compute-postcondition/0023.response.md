Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is at least 2, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is 1, `leftZero` is 2 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1 if `s[0]` is not '0' otherwise 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 1, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1 if `s[0]` is not '0' otherwise 0, `trightOne` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. Since `tleftZero` was initially 1 if `s[0]` is not '0' or 2 if `s[0]` is '0', after the increment, `tleftZero` becomes 2 if `s[0]` is not '0' or 3 if `s[0]` is '0'. However, the output state format requires us to describe it in a consistent way with the initial state conditions, so we describe it as `tleftZero` being 2 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 1, which is the updated state. All other variables remain unchanged.
