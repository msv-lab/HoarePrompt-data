The code snippet initializes the variable `rightZero` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `rightZero` changes from its previous state (which was not specified) to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is a new input integer, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0**.
