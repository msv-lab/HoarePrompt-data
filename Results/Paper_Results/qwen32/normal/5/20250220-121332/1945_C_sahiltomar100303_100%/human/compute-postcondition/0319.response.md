The code snippet increments the variable `rightOne` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged unless their values depend on `rightOne`, which they do not in this case. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `rightOne`.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is 3 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `right` is 4, `t` is 2, `a` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `s` is the new input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is 5, `rightOne` is increased by 1. If `s[i]` is '0', `rightZero` is 2. If `s[i]` is not '0', `rightOne` is increased by 1.** 

In simpler terms, the only change is that `rightOne` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
