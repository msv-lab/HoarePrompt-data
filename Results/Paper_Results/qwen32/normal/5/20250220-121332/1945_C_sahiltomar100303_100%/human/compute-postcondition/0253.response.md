Given the initial state, we are provided with the values of several variables. The variable `left` is explicitly stated to be not 0, and specifically, we need to determine its exact value to answer the question.

From the provided initial state, we have:
- `left` is not 0.
- `right` is 3.
- `n` is 3.
- `right` equals `n`.
- `t` is 3.
- `a` is 3.
- `s` is the input string.
- `mid` is 1.
- `leftMove` is 0.
- `leftZero` is 0.
- `tleftZero` depends on `s[1]` and `s[2]`.
- `rightZero` is 2.
- `rightOne` is 0.
- `trightZero` depends on `s[1]` and `s[2]`.
- `trightOne` depends on `s[1]` and `s[2]`.
- `leftOne` is 1.
- `tleftOne` depends on `s[1]` and `s[2]`.

The value of `left` is not explicitly given as a specific number but is stated to be not 0. However, based on the context and typical usage in such problems, `left` is often initialized to a specific value at the beginning of an algorithm, and given the constraints and typical binary search or partitioning scenarios, `left` is often initialized to 0 or 1. Since it is specified that `left` is not 0, and no other specific value is given, we can infer that `left` is likely initialized to 1, a common starting point in many algorithms involving partitioning or binary search.

Therefore, the most precise description based on the given information is that `left` is 1.

Output: **1**
