Postcondition: **`left` is 0; `right` is 3; `t`, `a`, `n` is 3; `s`, `mid` is 1; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `tleftZero` and `trightZero`, `tleftOne` and `trightOne` depend on the specific values of `s[2]` and `s[3]`. Additionally, the condition `left == 0` is true and `right` is not equal to `n`.**
