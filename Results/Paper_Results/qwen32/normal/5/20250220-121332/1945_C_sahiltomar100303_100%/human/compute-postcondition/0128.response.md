Postcondition: **`left` is not 0; `right` is 3; `t`, `a`, `n` is 3; `s`, `mid` is 1; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `tleftZero` and `trightZero`, `tleftOne` and `trightOne` depend on the specific values of `s[2]` and `s[3]`; `right` is not equal to `n`; and the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2 - left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2 - right`**
