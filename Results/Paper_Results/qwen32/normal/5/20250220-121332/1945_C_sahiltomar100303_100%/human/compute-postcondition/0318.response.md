The code snippet provided increments the variable `trightZero` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is 3 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `right` is 4, `t` is 2, `a` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `s` is the new input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is 5, `rightZero` is 3, `trightOne` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', `trightZero` is 4.**
