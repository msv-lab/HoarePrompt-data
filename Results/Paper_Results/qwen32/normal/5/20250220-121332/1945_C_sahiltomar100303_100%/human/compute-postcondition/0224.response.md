Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is 2, `t` is 3, `a` is 3, `n` is 3, `s` is the input string, `mid` is 1, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0. If the character at position `right - 1` in `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 2, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is 1, `tleftOne` is 1. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 2, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 1, `trightOne` is -1, `leftOne` is 1, `tleftOne` is 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `right` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding the character at position `right` in `s` now refers to the character at the new position `right - 1` (which is 1), since `right` has been incremented.
