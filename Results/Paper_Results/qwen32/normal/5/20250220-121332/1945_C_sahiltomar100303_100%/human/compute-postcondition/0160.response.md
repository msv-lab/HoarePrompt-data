Postcondition: **`left` is 0 or `left` is not 0; `right` is 3; `t` is 3; `a` is 3; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `trightZero` is 0; `trightOne` is 0; `s[i]` is the current character of the string `s`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2 and `tleftZero` is 2. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `leftOne` is 1 and `tleftOne` is 1. `rightZero` and `rightOne` remain 0; `i` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `s[i]` is not '0', `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are incremented by 1.**
