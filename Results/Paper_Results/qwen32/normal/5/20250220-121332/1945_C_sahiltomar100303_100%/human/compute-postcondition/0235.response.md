Initial State: `left` is 0, `right` is 3, `t` is 3, `a` is 3, `n` is 3, `s` is the input string, `mid` is 1, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 2, `rightOne` is 0

The provided code snippet is:
```
tleftOne += 1
```

This line of code increments the variable `tleftOne` by 1. Since `tleftOne` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it was 0 before this operation. After the operation, `tleftOne` becomes 1.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is 3, `t` is 3, `a` is 3, `n` is 3, `s` is the input string, `mid` is 1, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 2, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1**.
