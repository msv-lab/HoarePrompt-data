Postcondition: **`left` is not 0; `right` is 3; `t`, `a`, `n` is 3; `s`, `mid` is 1; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` depend on the specific values of `s[2]` and `s[3]`; `right` is not equal to `n`. If the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, the condition in the else part holds.**
