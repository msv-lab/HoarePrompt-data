The code increments the value of `trightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is a new input integer such that `n > 1`, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is 2, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is 1, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightOne` is 0, `i` is `mid`, and `s[i]` is '0'.**
