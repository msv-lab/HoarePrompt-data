Output State: **`left` is 0 or `left` is not 0; `right` is 3; `t` is 3; `a` is 3; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` depend on the specific values of `s[2]` and `s[3]`; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `rightOne` is explicitly set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
