The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which determines how many times the loop will execute. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `t` is the only one that needs adjustment here.

State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0**
