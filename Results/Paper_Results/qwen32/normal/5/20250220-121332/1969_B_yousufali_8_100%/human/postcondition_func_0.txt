The function `func_1` reads a binary string `s` from the input, processes it to count consecutive '1's before each '0', and prints the accumulated sum of these counts plus one for each '0' encountered. If the string ends with '1's, it adds the count of these trailing '1's to the sum. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value; it directly prints the result.
