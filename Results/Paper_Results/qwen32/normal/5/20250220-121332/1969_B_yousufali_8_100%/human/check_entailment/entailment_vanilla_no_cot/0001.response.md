To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) using the minimum cost of cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift operation on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is equal to `r - l + 1`.

### Key Insight

A critical observation is that to sort the binary string, we need to ensure that all 0s are to the left of all 1s. The optimal strategy involves moving all 1s to the right of all 0s. Each time we encounter a '0' after a '1', we need to perform operations to move the '1's encountered so far to the right of this '0'.

### Cost Calculation

For each '0' encountered after a '1', we need to perform cyclic shifts for all '1's encountered so far. If we have encountered `n` ones before a zero, the cost to move these `n` ones past this zero is `n + 1` (the cost of shifting the substring consisting of these `n` ones and the current zero).

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - Reads a binary string `s`.
    - Initializes `n` to 0 (to count the number of '1's encountered).
    - Initializes `ans` to 0 (to accumulate the total cost).
    - Iterates through each character in the string:
        - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
        - If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans` (cost to move the `n` ones past this zero).
    - Prints the accumulated cost `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

### Verification

The logic in `func_1` aligns with our key insight. Each time a '0' is encountered after '1's, the cost to move those '1's past the '0' is correctly calculated as `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of '1's encountered so far.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the described operations.

**Correctness: True**
