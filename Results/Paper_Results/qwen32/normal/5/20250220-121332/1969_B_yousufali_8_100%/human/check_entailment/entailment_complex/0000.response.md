### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to compute the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift operation on a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) is \( r - l + 1 \).

The given program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function processes a single binary string. It counts the number of consecutive '1's before each '0' and adds the count plus one to the total cost (`ans`). This is because each '0' encountered after a sequence of '1's can be moved to the beginning by performing a series of cyclic shifts on the substring consisting of those '1's and the '0'. The cost of moving a '0' to the beginning is equal to the number of '1's before it plus one (the '0' itself).

2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases (`t`) and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

Let's analyze the logic of `func_1()` more closely:
- For each '1' encountered, the counter `n` is incremented.
- When a '0' is encountered and `n` is not zero, the cost to move this '0' to the front is `n + 1` (the number of '1's before it plus the '0' itself). This cost is added to `ans`.
- If the string ends with '1's, the count of these trailing '1's is added to `ans` because they need to be moved to the end of the string.

This approach correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order. The logic is based on the fact that each '0' needs to be moved to the front of the string, and the cost is determined by the number of '1's that need to be shifted along with it.

### Correctness:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.

**Correctness: True**
