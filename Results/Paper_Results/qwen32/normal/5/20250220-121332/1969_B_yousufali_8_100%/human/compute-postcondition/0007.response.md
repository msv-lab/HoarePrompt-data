To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the value of `t` and the number of times `func_1()` has been executed.

Given:
- The loop runs `t` times, as specified by `for _ in range(t):`.
- `func_1()` is called in each iteration of the loop.

From the initial and intermediate output states provided:
- After 1 iteration: `t` must be greater than 0.
- After 2 iterations: `t` must be greater than 1.
- After 3 iterations: `t` must be greater than 2, and `func_1()` has been executed 3 times.

Following this pattern, after `t` iterations, `func_1()` will have been executed `t` times.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0; `func_1()` has been executed `t` times.**

In simpler terms, the loop will run `t` times, and `func_1()` will be called exactly `t` times, assuming `t` is a non-negative integer. If `t` is 0, the loop will not execute at all, and `func_1()` will not be called.
