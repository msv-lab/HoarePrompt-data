### Reasoning:
The provided problem requires determining the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.

Let's break down the provided functions:

- **Function `func_1`:** This function reads a binary string `s` from the input. It then iterates through the string, counting the number of consecutive '1's (`n`). Whenever a '0' is encountered and there are preceding '1's (`n != 0`), it adds `n + 1` to the total cost (`ans`). This cost calculation reflects the minimum cost required to shift all preceding '1's past the '0'. If the string ends with '1's, it adds the count of these trailing '1's to the sum. The function directly prints the accumulated cost.

- **Function `func_2`:** This function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. It then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times, processing each test case independently.

### Analysis:
The logic in `func_1` seems to align with the problem's requirements. Here's why:

1. **Cost Calculation:** The cost is calculated based on the number of '1's that need to be shifted past each '0'. When a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's, the cost is incremented by the number of preceding '1's plus one. This accounts for the minimum number of operations needed to bring all preceding '1's to the right of the '0'.

2. **Handling Trailing '1's:** If the string ends with '1's, these do not need to be shifted further, so the function correctly does not add any additional cost for trailing '1's.

3. **Multiple Test Cases:** `func_2` properly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions, when executed together, correctly compute the minimum cost required to sort each binary string in non-descending order using the specified operations.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
