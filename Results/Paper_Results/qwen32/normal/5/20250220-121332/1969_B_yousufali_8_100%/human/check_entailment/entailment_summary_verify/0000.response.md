### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the logic of the provided program and compare it with the problem description and the given examples.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Sort a binary string `s` in non-descending order using the minimum total cost, where the cost of cyclically shifting a substring `s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r` is `r - l + 1`.
- **Input**: 
  - The first line contains an integer `t` (number of test cases).
  - Each of the next `t` lines contains a binary string `s`.
- **Output**: For each test case, print the minimum total cost to sort the string.

#### Provided Program:
```python
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

#### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` counts the number of '1's encountered so far.
   - `ans` accumulates the total cost.
2. **Loop through the string**:
   - If the current character is '1', increment `n`.
   - If the current character is '0' and `n` is non-zero, add `n + 1` to `ans`.

#### Correctness Check:
The logic seems to be based on the observation that when a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's, the cost to shift those '1's to the right of the '0' is `n + 1` where `n` is the number of '1's encountered so far. This is because each '1' needs to be shifted past the '0' with a cost of 1 per shift, and the additional 1 accounts for the shift operation itself.

Let's test this logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: `s = "10"`
   - `n = 1` (first '1')
   - `ans = 1 + 1 = 2` (when '0' is encountered)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**: `s = "0000"`
   - No '1's, so `ans` remains 0.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**: `s = "11000"`
   - `n = 2` (first two '1's)
   - `ans = 2 + 1 = 3` (first '0' encountered)
   - `ans = 3 + 2 = 5` (second '0' encountered)
   - `ans = 5 + 2 = 7` (third '0' encountered)
   - Output: `9` (Incorrect, expected `9`)

   Let's break down the correct steps:
   - First '0': `n = 2` -> Cost = `2 + 1 = 3`
   - Second '0': `n = 2` -> Cost = `2 + 1 = 3`
   - Third '0': `n = 2` -> Cost = `2 + 1 = 3`
   - Total Cost = `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`
   - The program seems to be correct for this example.

4. **Example 4**: `s = "101011"`
   - `n = 1` (first '1')
   - `ans = 1 + 1 = 2` (first '0' encountered)
   - `n = 2` (second '1')
   - `ans = 2 + 2 = 4` (second '0' encountered)
   - `n = 3` (third '1')
   - `ans = 4 + 3 = 7` (third '0' encountered)
   - `n = 4` (fourth '1')
   - `ans = 7 + 4 = 11` (fourth '0' encountered)
   - Output: `11` (Correct)

5. **Example 5**: `s = "01101001"`
   - `n = 1` (first '1')
   - `ans = 1 + 1 = 2` (first '0' encountered)
   - `n = 2` (second '1')
   - `ans = 2 + 2 = 4` (second '0' encountered)
   - `n = 3` (third '1')
   - `ans = 4 + 3 = 7` (third '0' encountered)
   - `n = 4` (fourth '1')
   - `ans = 7 + 4 = 11` (fourth '0' encountered)
   - `n = 5` (fifth '1')
   - `ans = 11 + 5 = 16` (fifth '0' encountered)
   - `ans = 16 + 5 = 21` (sixth '0' encountered)
   - Output: `11` (Incorrect, expected `11`)

   Let's break down the correct steps:
   - First '0': `n = 1` -> Cost = `1 + 1 = 2`
   - Second '0': `n = 2` -> Cost = `2 + 1 = 3`
   - Third '0': `n = 3` -> Cost = `3 + 1 = 4`
   - Fourth '0': `n = 4` -> Cost = `4 + 1 = 5`
   - Fifth '0': `n = 5` -> Cost = `5 + 1 = 6`
   - Sixth '0': `n = 5` -> Cost = `5 + 1 = 6`
   - Total Cost = `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 6 = 26`
   - The program seems to be incorrect for this example.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to work correctly for some examples but not for others. Specifically, the logic for calculating the cost when encountering a '0' after '1's needs to be re-evaluated. The provided examples and edge cases suggest that the logic is not fully correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in all cases. While it works for some examples, it fails for others, indicating that the logic needs to be re-evaluated and corrected.
