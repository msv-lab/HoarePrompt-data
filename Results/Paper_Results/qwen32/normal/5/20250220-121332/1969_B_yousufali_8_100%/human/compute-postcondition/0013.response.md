The code snippet provided is:

```
ans += n + 1
```

Given the initial state:
- `s` is the input binary string that must have at least 1 character.
- `i` is `i + 1`. If `s[i]` was '1', then `n` is `n + 1`.

The code modifies the variable `ans` by adding `n + 1` to its current value. The variables `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged by this operation, except for the potential change in `n` based on the condition involving `s[i]`.

Output State: **`s` is the input binary string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is `i + 1`. If `s[i]` was '1', then `n` is `n + 1`. `ans` is `ans + n + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `s` remains the input binary string, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` was '1', and `ans` is increased by `n + 1`.
