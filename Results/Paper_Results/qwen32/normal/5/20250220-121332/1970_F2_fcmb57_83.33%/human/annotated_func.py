#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field, where 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd. b is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field, where 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd. The field is a list of N strings, each containing M pairs of characters separated by spaces. Each pair of characters can be ".." for an empty cell, "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9" for players, "RG" or "BG" for goals, ".Q" for the Quaffle, or ".B" for the Bludger. There is exactly one Quaffle and at least one goal for each team. The number of steps (T) is an integer where 0 <= T <= 10000. The next T lines describe the actions of the entities, where each action is a pair of characters representing the entity followed by a valid action (U, D, L, R, C <ball>, T).
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns a tuple (2*x, 2*y), where (x, y) are the elements of the tuple `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, a tuple representing coordinates, and `b`, another tuple representing changes in coordinates. It returns a new tuple where each element of `b` is added to the corresponding element of `a`.
