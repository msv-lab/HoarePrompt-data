The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the value it was at the end of the previous iteration, and `a` is a constant integer value representing the integer value of the original string `num`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`num` is a string representing a positive integer (1 ≤ int(num) ≤ 5000), `out` is an empty list, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `list1[2 * i]`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`, `a` is an integer equal to the integer value of the original string `num` (1 ≤ a ≤ 5000), `b` is the input string, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since the only variable that can be adjusted is `i`, and it should be incremented by 1:

State: **`num` is a string representing a positive integer (1 ≤ int(num) ≤ 5000), `out` is an empty list, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `list1[2 * i]`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`, `a` is an integer equal to the integer value of the original string `num` (1 ≤ a ≤ 5000), `b` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`**.

For clarity, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.

State: **`num` is a string representing a positive integer (1 ≤ int(num) ≤ 5000), `out` is an empty list, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `list1[2 * i]`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`, `a` is an integer equal to the integer value of the original string `num` (1 ≤ a ≤ 5000), `b` is the input string, `i` is 4**.

Generalizing, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`num` is a string representing a positive integer (1 ≤ int(num) ≤ 5000), `out` is an empty list, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `list1[2 * i]`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`, `a` is an integer equal to the integer value of the original string `num` (1 ≤ a ≤ 5000), `b` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`**.
