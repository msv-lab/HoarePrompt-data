The code snippet appends the sum of `list2` to the `out` list. Since `list2` contains integer values derived from specific elements of `list1`, and `out` was initially empty, after this operation, `out` will contain one element: the sum of `list2`.

Given that `num` is a string representing a positive integer, `a` is the integer value of `num`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`, and `list2` is a list of integer values from `list1` at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2*(a-1)), the sum of `list2` will be calculated and stored in `out`.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing a positive integer (1 ≤ int(num) ≤ 5000), `out` is a list containing the sum of `list2`, `list2` is a list containing the integer values of `list1[2 * j]` for all `j` from 0 to `a-1`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`, `a` is an integer equal to the integer value of the original string `num` (1 ≤ a ≤ 5000), `b` is the input string.**
