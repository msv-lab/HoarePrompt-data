#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that s represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n`, and values representing the cumulative balance of parentheses up to each index in `s`; `i` is `n-1`.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: ans is s.
    return ans
    #The program returns the variable `ans` which is `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that represents a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It returns the same string `s`.
