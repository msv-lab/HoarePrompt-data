Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys 0 and 1, and values 0 and -1, respectively; `i` is 0; `s[i]` is not '('**

Explanation: The dictionary `d` is updated to include the key 1 with the value -1, as `d[i + 1]` is set to `d[i] - 1`, and `i` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
