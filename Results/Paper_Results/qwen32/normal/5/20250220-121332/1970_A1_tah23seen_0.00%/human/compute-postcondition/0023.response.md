The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `j`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `d`. If `d` has more tuples, the loop will execute again for the next tuple.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` and `j` were set to the values of the first tuple in `d`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to move to the next tuple in `d`.

Let's denote the next tuple in `d` as `(i_next, j_next)`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i_next` and `j` should be `j_next`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing the character `s[i]`; `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the cumulative balance of parentheses up to each index in `s`; `i` and `j` are set to the values of the next tuple in `d`.**
