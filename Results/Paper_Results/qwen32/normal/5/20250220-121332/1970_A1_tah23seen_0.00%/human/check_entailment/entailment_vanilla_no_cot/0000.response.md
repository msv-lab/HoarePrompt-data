Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The dictionary `d` is being used to store the prefix balances, but the key-value pairs are not correctly utilized for sorting and constructing the balanced shuffle.
2. The sorting criteria are not correctly implemented as per the problem statement. The sorting should be done first by prefix balance in increasing order and then by position in decreasing order.
3. The positions are not handled correctly during the sorting process.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balances = []
    current_balance = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            current_balance += 1
        else:
            current_balance -= 1
        prefix_balances.append((current_balance, -i, s[i]))  # Use -i for decreasing order of position
    
    # Sort by balance first, then by position (in decreasing order)
    prefix_balances.sort()
    
    ans = ''.join([char for _, _, char in prefix_balances])
    return ans

n = input().strip()
print(func_1(n))
```

This corrected version properly calculates the prefix balances, sorts them according to the given criteria, and constructs the balanced shuffle.
