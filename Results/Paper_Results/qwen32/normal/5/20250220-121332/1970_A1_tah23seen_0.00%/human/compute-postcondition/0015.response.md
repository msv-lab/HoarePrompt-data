The code snippet `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1` updates the dictionary `d` by adding a new key-value pair where the key is `i + 1` (which is `3` since `i` is `2`) and the value is `d[i] + 1`.

Given that `i` is `2`, `d[2]` has a value of either `2`, `0`, or `-2` (depending on the value of `s[1]`). Therefore, `d[3]` will be `d[2] + 1`.

Let's break down the possible values:
- If `d[2]` is `2`, then `d[3]` will be `3`.
- If `d[2]` is `0`, then `d[3]` will be `1`.
- If `d[2]` is `-2`, then `d[3]` will be `-1`.

The other variables (`s`, `n`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys 0, 1, 2, and 3, and values 0, 1 (or -1), 2 (or 0) or -2 depending on whether `s[1]` is '(' or ')', and `d[3]` is `d[2] + 1`; `i` is 2.**
