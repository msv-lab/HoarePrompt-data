The code snippet `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1` updates the dictionary `d` by adding a new key-value pair. The key is `i + 1`, which is `1` since `i` is `0`. The value for this key is `d[i] + 1`, which is `0 + 1 = 1` because `d[0]` is `0`.

The variables `s`, `n`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. The string `s` is still a non-empty string of balanced parentheses with length not exceeding 500,000. The length `n` is still the length of `s`. The string `ans` is still an empty string. The variable `i` is still `0`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys 0 and 1, and values 0 and 1 respectively; `i` is 0**.
