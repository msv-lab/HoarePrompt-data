The code snippet reads new values for `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input and overwrites the existing values of these variables. The other variables (`t`, `A`, `B`, `ans`, `qi`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are the new values read from the input, `A` is `int(m/a) + 1`, `B` is `int(m/b) + 1`, `ans` is `m // a + m // b + 2`, `qi` is `t`.**
