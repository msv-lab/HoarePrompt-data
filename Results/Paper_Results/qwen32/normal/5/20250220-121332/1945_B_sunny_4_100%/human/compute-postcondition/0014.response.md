To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration.

The loop runs `t` times. For each iteration, it reads new values for `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input, calculates `ans` as `m // a + m // b + 2`, and prints `ans`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to read new values and compute `ans` for each iteration until `qi` reaches `t-1`.

After all iterations, `qi` will be equal to `t` (since the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`), and the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` will be the values read during the last iteration.

The final output state will be:
- `qi` will be `t`.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` will be the values read during the last iteration.
- `A` and `B` will be calculated based on the last `a`, `b`, and `m` values as `int(m/a) + 1` and `int(m/b) + 1` respectively.
- `ans` will be `m // a + m // b + 2` based on the last `a`, `b`, and `m` values.

However, since `A` and `B` are not used in the loop body, they are not relevant to the final output state described by the printed `ans` values.

Thus, the final output state will simply reflect the last iteration's computation and the completion of the loop.

Output State: **`qi` is `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are the values read during the last iteration, and the last computed `ans` is printed.**
