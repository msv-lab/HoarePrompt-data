Output State: **`t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is now `n // 2` (where `n` was originally greater than 1), `k` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is `x`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

In natural language: The value of `n` has been updated to be `n // 2`. All other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) retain their original values or definitions.
