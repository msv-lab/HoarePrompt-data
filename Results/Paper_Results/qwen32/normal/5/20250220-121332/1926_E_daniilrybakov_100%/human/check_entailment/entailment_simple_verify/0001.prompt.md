You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        m = 1
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2

            s += x
            m *= 2

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it accurately reflects the problem's requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Card Laying Process**:
   - Vladislav first lays down all the odd-numbered cards in ascending order.
   - Then, he lays down cards that are twice an odd number in ascending order.
   - Next, he lays down cards that are three times an odd number in ascending order, and so on.
   - He continues this process until all cards are laid down.

2. **Objective**:
   - For each test case, find the k-th card laid down by Vladislav.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided program step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the position `k`.

2. **Logic to Find the k-th Card**:
   - The program uses a loop to determine the correct multiplier `m` and the position `s` within that multiplier's sequence.
   - `s` keeps track of the cumulative count of cards laid down up to the current multiplier.
   - `m` is the current multiplier (starting from 1).
   - `x` is the number of cards in the current sequence of multiples of `m`.

3. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop continues until `s < k <= s + x`, meaning the k-th card is within the current sequence of multiples of `m`.
   - Inside the loop, `n` is halved in each iteration, and `s` is updated to reflect the number of cards laid down so far.
   - `m` is doubled in each iteration to move to the next sequence of multiples.

4. **Calculating the k-th Card**:
   - Once the correct sequence is identified, the k-th card is calculated using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.
   - This formula ensures that the card is the correct multiple of `m` based on its position within the sequence.

### Correctness Verification:
- The program correctly identifies the sequence of multiples (`m`) and the position within that sequence (`k - s`).
- It accurately calculates the k-th card using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`, which reflects the odd-numbered base and its multiples.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
