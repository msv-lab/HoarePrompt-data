Output State: **`n` is `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 2, `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
