The value of `x` is assigned the result of the integer division of `(n + 1)` by `2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, and `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.
