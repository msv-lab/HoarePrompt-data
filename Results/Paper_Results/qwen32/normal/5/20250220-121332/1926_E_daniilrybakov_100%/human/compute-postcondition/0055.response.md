The code snippet `m *= 2` multiplies the variable `m` by 2. Given that the initial value of `m` is 4, after executing this line, `m` will be 8. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input value such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is the original `n` integer value divided by 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that \(1 \leq k \leq \text{original } n\); `s` is `(original n + 1) + (original n + 1) // 2`; `m` is 8; `x` is `(original n + 1) // 2`.**
