Output State: **`n` is `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 2, `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`. If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the value of `s` is now `(n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`, which is equivalent to `2 * (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
