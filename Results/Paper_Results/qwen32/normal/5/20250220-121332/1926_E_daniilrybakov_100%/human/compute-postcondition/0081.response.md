Postcondition: **`n` is `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 4, `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`. If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.**
