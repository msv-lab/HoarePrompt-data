The `while` loop in the given code will execute as long as `n` is truthy. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered truthy, and a zero integer is considered falsy. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be a non-zero integer.

Given the conditions:
- `t` is an integer input value such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\)
- `n` is the first integer read from the input
- `k` is the second integer read from the input such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\)
- `s` is 0
- `m` is 1

The only variable in the loop head is `n`. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be a non-zero integer. Since `n` is the first integer read from the input, we need to ensure it is not zero.

State: **`t` is an integer input value such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is the second integer read from the input such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `s` is 0, `m` is 1**
