Output State: **t is 0, n is 0, k is the last input integer, s is the accumulated sum of `(n + 1) // 2` for all iterations, m is `2^i` where `i` is the total number of iterations for the last test case.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because it counts down from the initial value to 0, indicating no more test cases to process. The variable `n` will be 0 because it is reduced to 0 in each test case's while loop. The variable `k` will hold the value of `k` from the last test case processed. The variable `s` will be the accumulated sum of `(n + 1) // 2` for all iterations of the while loop in the last test case, and `m` will be `2` raised to the power of the number of iterations it took to reduce `n` to 0 in the last test case.
