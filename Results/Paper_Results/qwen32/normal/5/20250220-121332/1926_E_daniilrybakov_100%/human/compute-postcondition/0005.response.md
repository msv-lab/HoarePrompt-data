The `while` loop in the provided code will execute as long as the condition `n` is truthy. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy, and zero is considered falsy. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be a non-zero integer.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `s` is 0
- `m` is 1

The variable `n` is already constrained to be between 1 and 10^9, which means it will always be a non-zero integer. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n` to ensure the loop executes at least once.

Since only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and `n` is already guaranteed to be non-zero, the state right before the loop does not need to be modified.

State: **`t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is 0, `m` is 1**
