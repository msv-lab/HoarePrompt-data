The only variables in the loop head are `x` and the range parameters `0` and `len(nums)`. Since the loop iterates over `x` from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`, we need to adjust `x` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `num_tests` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces and must have at least 1 integer
- `start_year` is `(start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`
- `x` is 1

In the previous iteration, `x` was 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces and must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is `(start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`, `x` is 2**
