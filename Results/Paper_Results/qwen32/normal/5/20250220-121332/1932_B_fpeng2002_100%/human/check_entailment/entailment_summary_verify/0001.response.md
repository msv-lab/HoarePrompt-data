### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly analyzes the problem and the provided Python program. Here is a systematic breakdown to ensure the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Understanding:
The task is to determine the year when the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs at regular intervals and must occur sequentially. The i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years, and the next sign must occur strictly after the previous one.

#### Program Analysis:
The program processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the number of signs `n`.
2. Reads the list of periodicities `nums`.
3. Initializes `start_year` to 0.
4. Iterates over each sign's periodicity:
   - Updates `start_year` to the next occurrence of the current sign after `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
5. Prints the final `start_year` after processing all signs.

#### Verification:
The program's logic is correct and matches the problem's requirements. Here's the verification with the provided example:

- **First Test Case:**
  - `start_year` starts at 0.
  - For the first sign (period 3): `(0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - For the second sign (period 2): `(3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - For the third sign (period 4): `(4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - For the fourth sign (period 5): `(8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - For the fifth sign (period 9): `(10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - For the sixth sign (period 18): `(18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
  - Output: `36` (matches the example)

- **Second Test Case:**
  - `start_year` starts at 0.
  - For the first sign (period 1): `(0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
  - For the second sign (period 2): `(1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
  - For the third sign (period 3): `(2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - For the fourth sign (period 4): `(3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
  - For the fifth sign (period 5): `(4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
  - Output: `5` (matches the example)

- **Third Test Case:**
  - `start_year` starts at 0.
  - For each sign (period 1): `(start_year // 1 + 1) * 1 = start_year + 1`
  - Output: `5` (matches the example)

- **Fourth Test Case:**
  - `start_year` starts at 0.
  - For the first sign (period 50): `(0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
  - For the second sign (period 30): `(50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
  - For the third sign (period 711): `(60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
  - For the fourth sign (period 200): `(711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 900`
  - For the fifth sign (period 503): `(900 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
  - For the sixth sign (period 1006): `(1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
  - Output: `2012` (matches the example)

#### Function Summary:
The function summary accurately describes the program's behavior: it processes multiple test cases and calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Final: **True**
