Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly computes the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen according to the rules described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs, `n`, and the list of periodicities, `nums`.
3. It initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year from which we start waiting for the next sign.
4. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by:
   - Dividing `start_year` by the periodicity `nums[x]` to find how many full cycles have passed.
   - Adding 1 to ensure we wait for the next occurrence after the last one.
   - Multiplying by `nums[x]` to get the actual year of the next occurrence.
5. It prints the `start_year` after processing all signs for the current test case.

The logic used to determine the next occurrence year is correct and aligns with the problem's requirement for signs to occur sequentially. Therefore, the program is correct.
