Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `num_tests` must be greater than 0; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `num_tests` is decreased by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `num_tests` is reduced by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
