The code snippet `n = int(input())` reassigns the value of `n` to a new integer value obtained from the input. The other variables (`num_tests`, `nums`, `start_year`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces, `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `nums`, `x` is len(nums) - 1**
