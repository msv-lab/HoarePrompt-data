You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Good Array Definition**: An array `a` of length `m` is considered good if there exists an integer array `b` of length `m` such that:
  1. The sum of elements in `a` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
  2. For every index `i` from 1 to `m`, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.
  3. Every element in `b` is greater than 0.
- **Input**:
  - `t`: Number of test cases.
  - For each test case:
    - `n`: Length of the array `c`.
    - `q`: Number of queries.
    - `c`: Array of integers where each element is greater than 0.
    - `q` lines of queries, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing the borders of the subarray.
- **Output**:
  - For each query, print "YES" if the subarray is good, otherwise print "NO".

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `q`, and the array `c`.
   - It initializes `a` as a prefix sum array of `c` with an extra 0 at the beginning for 1-based indexing.
   - It initializes `b` as a prefix sum array where each element is either 1 or 2 based on whether the corresponding element in `c` is greater than 1 or not.

2. **Logic for Determining if a Subarray is Good**:
   - For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]` using the prefix sum array `a`.
   - It calculates the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b` using the prefix sum array `b`.
   - It checks if the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the subarray in `b` or if the subarray length is 1 (`x == y`). If either condition is true, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Potential Issues:
- **Condition 2 of Good Array**: The program does not ensure that `a[i] != b[i]` for every index `i` in the subarray. It only ensures that the sum of `a` is not less than the sum of `b`. This is a critical oversight because the problem specifically requires that **every element** in `a` must be different from the corresponding element in `b`.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle the case where the subarray length is 1 correctly. If `x == y`, the program should check if `c[x]` can be transformed into a different positive integer `b[x]` such that `a[x] != b[x]`. The current logic simply prints "NO" for such cases, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the requirement that `a[i] != b[i]` for every index `i` in the subarray. It also incorrectly handles the case where the subarray length is 1.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
1 1
2
1 1
```
- The subarray is `[2]`.
- The sum of the subarray in `a` is `2`.
- The sum of the subarray in `b` is `1` (since `b[1] = 1`).
- The program prints "YES" because `2` is not less than `1`, but this is incorrect because `a[1]` must not equal `b[1]`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the requirement that `a[i] != b[i]` for every index `i` in the subarray and incorrectly handles the case where the subarray length is 1.
