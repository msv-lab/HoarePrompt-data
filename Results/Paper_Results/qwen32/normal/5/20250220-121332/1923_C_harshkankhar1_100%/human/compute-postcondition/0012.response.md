Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining `n` elements are the integers read from the input; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers, where each `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from `b[1]` to `b[i]` with `x` being 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2; `i` is `n`; `x` is 1 if `a[n] > 1` else 2.`**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains the same as it was initially, representing the number of test cases.
- The variable `n` remains the same, representing the number of elements in the list `c` and the number of iterations the loop will perform.
- The variable `q` remains the same, representing the number of queries.
- The list `c` remains unchanged, containing `n` integers.
- The list `a` remains unchanged, with the first element as 0 and the subsequent `n` elements as the integers read from the input.
- The list `b` is updated such that each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of the values `x` from `b[1]` to `b[i]`, where `x` is determined by whether `a[i]` is greater than 1 or not.
- The loop variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `x` will be determined by the value of `a[n]`, being 1 if `a[n] > 1` or 2 otherwise.
