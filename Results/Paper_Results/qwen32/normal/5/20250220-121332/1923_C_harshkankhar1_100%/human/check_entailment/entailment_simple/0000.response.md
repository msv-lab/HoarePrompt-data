### Reasoning:
The given program aims to determine if a subarray of the array `c` is "good" according to the specified conditions. However, the current implementation does not correctly evaluate these conditions.

Let's break down the conditions for a subarray to be "good":
1. The sum of the elements in the subarray must equal the sum of the elements in another array `b` of the same length.
2. Each element in the subarray must be different from the corresponding element in `b`.
3. Each element in `b` must be greater than 0.

The program's logic for constructing array `b` is flawed. It sets `b[i]` to be the cumulative sum of `x` values, where `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2. This does not ensure that `b[i] > 0` for all `i`, nor does it ensure that the sum of `b` equals the sum of the subarray. Furthermore, the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` does not correctly check if the subarray is "good".

To correctly determine if a subarray is "good," we need to construct array `b` such that:
- The sum of `b` equals the sum of the subarray.
- Each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in the subarray.
- Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

A possible correct approach would be to:
- Calculate the sum of the subarray.
- Create array `b` by adjusting the elements of the subarray to ensure they are different from the original elements while maintaining the same sum and being greater than 0.

However, the provided code does not implement this logic correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
