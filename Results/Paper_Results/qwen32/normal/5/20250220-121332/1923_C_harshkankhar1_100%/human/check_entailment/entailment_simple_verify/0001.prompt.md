You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks us to determine if a subarray of `c` is "good". A subarray is considered "good" if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that:
1. The sum of elements in the subarray `c` equals the sum of elements in the subarray `b`.
2. No element in the subarray `c` is equal to the corresponding element in the subarray `b`.
3. All elements in the subarray `b` are positive.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the given program step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the length of the array `n`, and the number of queries `q` are read.
   - The array `c` is read and stored as `a` with an extra `0` at the beginning for easier indexing.
   - An array `b` of length `n + 1` is initialized with `0` values.

2. **Constructing Array `b`:**
   - For each element in `a` (starting from index 1), the program sets `b[i]` to `b[i - 1] + x`, where `x` is `1` if `a[i] > 1` and `2` otherwise.
   - This step aims to create a cumulative sum for `b` such that the difference `b[i] - b[i - 1]` will be `1` if `a[i] > 1` and `2` if `a[i] == 1`. This is to ensure that `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] != b[i]`.

3. **Cumulative Sum of `a`:**
   - The array `a` is transformed into its cumulative sum using `accumulate`.

4. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `x` and `y`.
   - It then checks if the sum of the subarray `c[x:y+1]` (which is `a[y] - a[x - 1]`) is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray `b[x:y+1]` (which is `b[y] - b[x - 1]`).
   - If the sum of `c[x:y+1]` is less than the sum of `b[x:y+1]`, or if `x == y` (which would imply a single-element subarray that cannot be "good" under the given conditions), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Evaluation

The logic in the program has a few issues:
- The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is "good". The sum of `b` is constructed to ensure that `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] != b[i]`, but it doesn't guarantee that `sum(c[x:y+1]) = sum(b[x:y+1])`.
- The program does not correctly handle the case where `x == y`. A single-element subarray can be "good" if `c[x] > 1` because we can set `b[x] = 1`.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly determine if a subarray is "good" based on the problem's conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
