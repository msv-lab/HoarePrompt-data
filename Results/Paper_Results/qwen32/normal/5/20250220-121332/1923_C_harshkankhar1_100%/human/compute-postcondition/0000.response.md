Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `q` are assigned based on the input, splitting the input into two integers. The other variables (`t`, `c`, `l_i`, `r_i`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
