### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the solution provided in the code to determine if it is correct.

The goal is to maximize the profit from selling `n` buns under the given promotion rules. Here's the key logic:

1. **If `b <= a`:** 
   - Selling all buns at the usual price `a` is optimal because the modified price is not beneficial.
   - Profit = `a * n`.

2. **If `b > a`:**
   - Bob should sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`.
   - The remaining `n - k` buns should be sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{k \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})}{2}
     \]
     Here, the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`.

   - Profit from the first `k` buns = \(\frac{k \times (b + (b - k + 1))}{2}\).
   - Profit from the remaining `n - k` buns = `(n - k) * a`.
   - Total profit = \(\frac{k \times (b + (b - k + 1))}{2} + (n - k) \times a\).

The value of `k` should be chosen to maximize the profit. The code uses `k = min(n, b - a)` to determine the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price. This is because selling more than `b - a` buns at the modified price would not be beneficial since the price would drop below `a`.

### Verification with the Example:

Let's verify the code with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1: `4 4 5`**
   - `b > a`, so we calculate `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`.
   - Profit = \(\frac{1 \times (5 + (5 - 1 + 1))}{2} + (4 - 1) \times 4 = 5 + 12 = 17\).

2. **Test Case 2: `5 5 9`**
   - `b > a`, so we calculate `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 5`.
   - Profit = \(\frac{5 \times (9 + (9 - 5 + 1))}{2} + (5 - 5) \times 5 = 35 + 0 = 35\).

3. **Test Case 3: `10 10 5`**
   - `b <= a`, so we calculate `k = 0`.
   - Profit = `10 * 10 = 100`.

4. **Test Case 4: `5 5 11`**
   - `b > a`, so we calculate `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`.
   - Profit = \(\frac{5 \times (11 + (11 - 5 + 1))}{2} + (5 - 5) \times 5 = 45 + 0 = 45\).

5. **Test Case 5: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`**
   - `b <= a`, so we calculate `k = 0`.
   - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.

6. **Test Case 6: `1000000000 1000000000 1`**
   - `b <= a`, so we calculate `k = 0`.
   - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.

7. **Test Case 7: `1000 1 1000`**
   - `b > a`, so we calculate `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`.
   - Profit = \(\frac{999 \times (1000 + (1000 - 999 + 1))}{2} + (1000 - 999) \times 1 = 500500 + 1 = 500500\).

The code correctly computes the maximum profit for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain from selling the buns under the given promotion rules.

**Correctness: True**
