Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers. The function returns a value based on the specific logic applied to `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.**
