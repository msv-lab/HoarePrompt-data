The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use. In this context, the loop will execute based on the number of iterations specified by `int(input())`, which is `t` in this case. 

Given that `t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 10^4\), it means that at the end of the previous iteration, `t` was decremented by 1. To execute one more iteration, `t` must be decremented by 1 again, so `t` should be one more than the current value of `t` at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `t` decremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input, split by spaces; `b` is compared to `a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `k` is set to the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. Otherwise, if `b` is greater than `a`, `k` is still set to the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.**
