Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input, split by spaces; `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the program executes the if part; otherwise, it executes the else part. In both cases, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and `k` is calculated as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.**
