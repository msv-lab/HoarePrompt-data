Let's break down the given code and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t - 1 <= 10^4. (This variable `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.)
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input, split by spaces.
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, then `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the value of `k`:**
   - If `b <= a`, then `k = min(n, b - a)`.
   - If `b > a`, then `k = min(n, b - a)`.

   Notice that in both cases, `k` is defined as `min(n, b - a)`. Therefore, regardless of whether `b` is less than or equal to `a` or greater than `a`, the value of `k` is the same.

2. **Substitute `k` into the print statement:**
   - The expression to be printed is:
     \[
     \left(\frac{b + (b - k + 1)}{2}\right) \times k + (n - k) \times a
     \]

3. **Simplify the expression:**
   - First, simplify the term inside the parentheses:
     \[
     b + (b - k + 1) = 2b - k + 1
     \]
   - Then, divide by 2:
     \[
     \frac{2b - k + 1}{2} = b - \frac{k}{2} + \frac{1}{2}
     \]
   - Multiply by `k`:
     \[
     \left(b - \frac{k}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\right) \times k = bk - \frac{k^2}{2} + \frac{k}{2}
     \]
   - Add the second part of the expression:
     \[
     bk - \frac{k^2}{2} + \frac{k}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]
   - Distribute `a`:
     \[
     bk - \frac{k^2}{2} + \frac{k}{2} + na - ka
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     bk - ka + na - \frac{k^2}{2} + \frac{k}{2}
     \]
     \[
     (b - a)k + na - \frac{k^2}{2} + \frac{k}{2}
     \]

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the value of the expression \((b - a)k + na - \frac{k^2}{2} + \frac{k}{2}\), where `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

Output: **(b - a)k + na - (k^2 / 2) + (k / 2) (where k is the minimum value between n and b - a)**
