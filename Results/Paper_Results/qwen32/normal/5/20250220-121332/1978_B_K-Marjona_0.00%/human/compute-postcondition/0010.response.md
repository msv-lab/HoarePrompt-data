Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t - 1 <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input, split by spaces; if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `b` is less than or equal to `a` and `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. Otherwise, `b` is greater than `a` and `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.**

In simple terms, the output state is: `t` remains the same positive integer within the given range; `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their input values; `k` is calculated as the minimum of `n` and the difference `b - a`.
