You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.

    #State: The loop has processed `t` test cases, and the last values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are those from the final iteration. The value of `t` remains as the initial input value but is no longer relevant to the loop control.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a number of test cases specified by `t`. For each test case, it takes three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, and prints a computed value based on these inputs. The computed value is determined by whether `b` is less than or equal to `a` or greater than `a`, using specific arithmetic operations to derive the result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The issue lies in the calculation of `k` and the subsequent profit calculation.

Here are the specific issues:

1. **Calculation of `k`**: The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the case where selling some buns at the modified price could yield a higher profit than selling all at the usual price or a different number of buns at the modified price.

2. **Profit Calculation**: The program calculates the profit based on the incorrect `k`. It sums the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1` and adds the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`. However, this does not guarantee the maximum profit.

### Correct Approach:
To find the maximum profit, we need to consider selling up to `n` buns at the modified price and compare the total profit for each possible `k` from `0` to `n`. Specifically, for each `k`, the profit can be calculated as:
- Sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`.
- Plus the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

The correct way to calculate the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series is:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{k \cdot (b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \]

The total profit for a given `k` is:
\[ \text{Profit}(k) = \frac{k \cdot (b + (b - k + 1))}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a \]

We need to iterate over all possible values of `k` from `0` to `n` and find the maximum profit.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the test case:
```
1
5 5 9
```
The program calculates `k` as `min(5, 9 - 5) = 4`. The profit calculation for `k = 4` is:
\[ \text{Profit}(4) = \frac{4 \cdot (9 + (9 - 4 + 1))}{2} + (5 - 4) \cdot 5 = \frac{4 \cdot 15}{2} + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 \]
This is correct for this specific case, but the program does not guarantee this for all cases.

However, consider another test case:
```
1
5 5 11
```
The program calculates `k` as `min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`. The profit calculation for `k = 5` is:
\[ \text{Profit}(5) = \frac{5 \cdot (11 + (11 - 5 + 1))}{2} + (5 - 5) \cdot 5 = \frac{5 \cdot 17}{2} + 0 = 42.5 \]
Since the profit must be an integer, this indicates an issue with the logic. The correct approach should be to iterate over all `k` from `0` to `5` and find the maximum profit.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = (k * (b + (b - k + 1)) // 2) + (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This corrected program ensures that the maximum profit is calculated by considering all possible values of `k` from `0` to `n`.
