The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state of `t` is not affected by this code snippet. The conditions regarding `k` are not evaluated or changed by this snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t - 1 <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input, split by spaces; if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `b` is less than or equal to `a` and `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. Otherwise, `b` is greater than `a` and `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.**
