Based on the initial state provided, let's analyze the variables and the print statement:

- `i` is set to `i + 1`, but its initial value is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value.
- `n` is an input integer, but its value is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value.
- `a` is a string input by the user, but its value is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value.
- `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`, but since `a` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `count`.

Despite the lack of specific values for `i`, `n`, `a`, and `count`, the print statement is straightforward. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **NO**
