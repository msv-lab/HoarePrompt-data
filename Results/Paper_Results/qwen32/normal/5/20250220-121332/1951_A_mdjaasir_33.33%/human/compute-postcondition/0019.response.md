Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the value provided by the user input; `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`, and `count` is greater than 0. Additionally, either `count` is less than or equal to 2, or `count` is not an even number. If `count` is exactly 2, then the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is either not immediately followed by another '1', or the first occurrence of '1' is at index 0 and the element immediately following the first '1' is also '1'. If `count` is not 2, then `count` is greater than 0 and either `count` is less than or equal to 2, or `count` is not an even number.**
