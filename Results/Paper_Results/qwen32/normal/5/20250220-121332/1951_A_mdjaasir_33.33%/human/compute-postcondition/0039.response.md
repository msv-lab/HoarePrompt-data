Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `i` is `i + 1`: This suggests that `i` is being incremented by 1, but the initial value of `i` is not provided.
2. `n` is an input integer: This means `n` holds an integer value that is provided as input.
3. `a` is a string input by the user: This means `a` holds a string value that is provided as input.
4. `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`: This means `count` is an integer representing the occurrences of the character '1' in the string `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, or `count`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
