Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new value provided by the user input; `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `a`; `i` is `i` + 1. Regardless of whether `count` is 2 or not, the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `count`, and `i` retain their described values with `i` incremented by 1. If `count` is 2, the condition checks if the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is not followed by another '1', but this check does not affect the values of the variables.**
