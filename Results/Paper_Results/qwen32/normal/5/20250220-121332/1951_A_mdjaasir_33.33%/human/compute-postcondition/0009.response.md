The provided initial state includes several variables and conditions, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables described in the initial state. The `print` statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will simply print the string `'YES'` to the console. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `count` do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
