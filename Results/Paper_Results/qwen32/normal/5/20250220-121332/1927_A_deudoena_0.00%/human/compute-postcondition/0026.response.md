Postcondition: **`ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is `i` if the character at the position `inpstr[-i - 1]` is 'B', otherwise `ind2` remains 0, `outind` remains 0, `inpstr` must have at least one character, `i` is incremented by 1. If the character at `inpstr[-i - 1]` is 'B', the loop or if statement is broken out of.**
