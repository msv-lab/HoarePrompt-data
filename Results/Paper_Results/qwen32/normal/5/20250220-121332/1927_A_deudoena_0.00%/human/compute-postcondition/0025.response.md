Output State: **`ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is `i`, `outind` remains 0, `inpstr` must have at least one character, `i` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `ind1`, `ind2`, `outind`, and the precondition that `inpstr` must have at least one character remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
