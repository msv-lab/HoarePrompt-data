The provided code snippet is:
```
ind1 = i
```

However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the code will result in a `NameError` because it tries to assign the value of `i` to `ind1`, but `i` is not defined anywhere in the given context.

If we assume there was a variable `i` defined somewhere in the code that is not shown here, and `i` had a specific value, the output state would reflect that value being assigned to `ind1`. Since `i` is not defined, we cannot proceed with the simulation.

Given the lack of definition for `i`, the output state cannot be determined accurately. However, if we hypothetically consider that `i` was defined and had a specific value, the output state would be described as follows:

Assuming hypothetically `i` had a value, say `i = 5`, then:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' present in `s`, `inpstr` is a non-empty string, `ind1` is 5, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0, and `j` is 'B'.**

Since `i` is not defined, the actual output state cannot be determined from the provided information. The code will raise an error.
