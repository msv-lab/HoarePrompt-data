The `break` statement in the given code does not affect any of the variables directly; it only exits the most internal loop or if statement it is placed within. Since there is no loop or if statement provided in the context, the `break` statement itself has no impact on the variables `t`, `n`, `s`, `inpstr`, `ind1`, `ind2`, `outind`, or `j`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' present in `s`, `inpstr` is a non-empty string, `ind1` is 5, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0, and `j` is 'B'.**
