Postcondition: **`ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `outind` remains 0, `inpstr` must have at least one character, `i` is incremented by 1. If the character at the position `inpstr[-i - 1]` is 'B', then `ind2` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ind2` remains 0.**
