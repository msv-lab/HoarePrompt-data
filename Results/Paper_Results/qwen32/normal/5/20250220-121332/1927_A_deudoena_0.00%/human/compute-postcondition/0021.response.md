Output State: **`ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is `i`, `outind` remains 0, `inpstr` must have at least one character, and the character at the position `inpstr[-i - 1]` is 'B'. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `ind1`, `ind2`, `outind`, or `inpstr`. It only causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
