The value of `ind2` is updated to the value of `i`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is `i`, `outind` remains 0, `inpstr` must have at least one character, and the character at the position `inpstr[-i - 1]` is 'B'.
