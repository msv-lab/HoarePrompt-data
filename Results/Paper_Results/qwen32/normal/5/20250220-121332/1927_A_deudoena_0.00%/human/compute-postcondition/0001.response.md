The code snippet provided assigns the value `0` to the variable `ind1`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, and `inpstr`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' present in `s`; `inpstr` is the input string; `ind1` is 0.**
