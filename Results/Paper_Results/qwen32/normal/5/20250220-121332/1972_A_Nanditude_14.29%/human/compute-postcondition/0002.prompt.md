You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case. Each test case contains three parts: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a list a of length n (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), and a list b of length n (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). The first element of each test case is the integer n, followed by the list a, and then the list b.
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order. Each inner list in `arr`, which represents a test case, is sorted as a whole (not its individual elements) in reverse order based on lexicographical comparison.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of lists. Each inner list represents a test case containing an integer `n` and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. The function returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order based on lexicographical comparison of each inner list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order. Each inner list in `arr`, which represents a test case, is sorted as a whole (not its individual elements) in reverse order based on lexicographical comparison.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
