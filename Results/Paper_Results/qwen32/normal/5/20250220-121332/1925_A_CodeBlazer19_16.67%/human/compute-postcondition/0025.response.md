To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the provided information and the loop structure.

The loop iterates over the range from 97 to `k + 97`. Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After the 1st iteration, `s` contains 'a' (since `chr(97)` is 'a').
- After the 2nd iteration, `s` contains 'ab' (since `chr(98)` is 'b').
- After the 3rd iteration, `s` contains 'abc' (since `chr(99)` is 'c').

From this, we can see that `s` is a string of consecutive lowercase letters starting from 'a' up to the `k`-th letter in the alphabet. Thus, after all iterations, `s` will contain the string of the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet.

The loop does not modify `t`, `n`, `i`, or any other variables outside the loop body, so these variables will remain unchanged.

Given that `k` must be at least 3 to have completed 3 iterations, we can generalize that after all iterations, `s` will contain the first `k` letters of the alphabet.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676, `n` is the first integer provided by the input, `k` is the second integer provided by the input, `s` is a string containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet, `i` is 4.**

In simpler terms, the string `s` will be the first `k` letters of the alphabet, and all other variables will remain as they were initially.
