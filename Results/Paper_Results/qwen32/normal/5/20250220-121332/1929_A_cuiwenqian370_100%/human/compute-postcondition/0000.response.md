The provided code snippet only imports the `read` method from `sys.stdin` and assigns it to the variable `input`. This does not affect the values of the existing variables `array`, `n`, or any `a_i` in the array. The variable `input` now refers to the `read` method, which can be used to read from the standard input.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length `n` (2 <= `n` <= 100), and each integer `a_i` in the array satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`.**
