Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is 1; `index` is `4 + int(data[1]) + n + n`; `results` is a list containing three elements, the first being `result`, the second being the newly appended `result`, and the third being the newly appended `result` again; `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)` and has been updated to the new value returned by `func_1(array)`**

Explanation: The `results` list has been updated to include the `result` value a third time, as the `result` was appended to the `results` list twice before the given code snippet. The other variables remain unchanged.
