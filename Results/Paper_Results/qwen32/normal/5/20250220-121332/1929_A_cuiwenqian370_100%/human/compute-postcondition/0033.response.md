To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's carefully analyze the given information:

The loop iterates over the elements in the `results` list, which contains `int(data[0])` elements. Each iteration prints the current `result`, which is an element from `results`.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue until all elements in `results` have been printed. Therefore, the loop will execute `int(data[0])` times.

After all iterations, the state of the variables will be as follows:

- `array` remains the same as it was derived from `data[index:index + n]` and is not modified in the loop.
- `data` remains unchanged as it is only used to derive `array` and `results` at the start and is not altered during the loop.
- `t` remains 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
- `index` remains the same as it is calculated once at the start and not changed during the loop.
- `results` remains the same as it is only used to provide values for the `result` variable during each iteration and is not modified.
- `n` remains the same as it is calculated once at the start and not changed during the loop.
- `result` will be the last element of `results` after the loop finishes, as it is the final value assigned to `result` in the loop.

The loop will have printed all elements of the `results` list, and there will be no more elements to iterate over.

Output State: **array is a list of integers derived from data[index:index + n]; data is a list of strings; t is 0; index is 1 + sum(int(data[i]) for i in range(1, 1 + 3*int(data[0])) if i % (int(data[i]) + 1) == 1); results is a list containing int(data[0]) elements, each being the output of func_1(array) for the corresponding iteration; n is an integer equal to int(data[index - 1]); result is the last element in results.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop will have printed all the elements from the `results` list, and the state of all variables will remain as they were defined at the start, except that `result` will be the last element of `results`.
