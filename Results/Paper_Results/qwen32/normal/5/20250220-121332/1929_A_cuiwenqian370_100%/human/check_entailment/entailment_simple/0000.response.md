### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the "beauty" of an array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. To maximize this sum, we need to arrange the elements in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. The optimal arrangement is to sort the array in ascending or descending order because this will maximize the difference between consecutive elements.

The provided program does exactly this. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the total number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The array is passed to `func_1`, which sorts the array.
   - It then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

3. **Output:**
   - The beauty for each test case is calculated and stored in the `results` list.
   - Finally, the program prints the beauty for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Sorting the Array:** Sorting the array in ascending or descending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which is the goal of maximizing the beauty.
- **Calculating Beauty:** The beauty is calculated correctly by iterating through the sorted array and summing the differences between consecutive elements.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:** The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and processing each one individually.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
