### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, the program code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging, i.e., \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} |a_i - a_{i-1}|\).

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(array)`: Sorts the array and calculates the beauty.
2. `func_2()`: Reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each using `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Evaluation Using Function Summary:
- **Function `func_1(array)`**:
  - **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array in ascending or descending order will maximize the beauty. This is because the largest differences will be between the smallest and largest elements, ensuring the maximum possible sum of absolute differences.
  - **Calculating the Beauty**: The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after sorting. This approach correctly maximizes the beauty.

- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - **Reading Input**: The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the length and elements of the array.
  - **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it calls `func_1(array)` to compute the beauty and stores the result.
  - **Printing Results**: After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

#### Edge Cases:
- **All Elements the Same**: If all elements are the same, the beauty will be 0 because the differences between consecutive elements will be 0.
- **Two Elements**: For an array with only two elements, the beauty is simply the absolute difference between the two elements.
- **Largest and Smallest Elements**: Sorting ensures that the largest and smallest elements are placed at the extremes, maximizing the beauty.

#### Verification:
- **Sorting and Beauty Calculation**: The approach of sorting the array and calculating the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements is correct. This is because sorting maximizes the differences, which is the goal.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The program handles multiple test cases by reading input, processing each test case, and printing the results, which matches the problem description.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. It also handles multiple test cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
