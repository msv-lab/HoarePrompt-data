The value of `n` is reassigned to `int(data[index])`. The previous values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer equal to the previous `t` minus 1, `index` is `2 + int(data[1])`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index])`, `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer equal to the previous `t` minus 1, `index` is `2 + int(data[1])`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index])`, `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**.
