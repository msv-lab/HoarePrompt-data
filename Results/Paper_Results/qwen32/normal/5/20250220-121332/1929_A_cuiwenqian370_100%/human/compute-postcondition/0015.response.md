The code snippet updates the `array` variable by mapping the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` to integers. The other variables (`data`, `t`, `index`, `results`, `n`, `result`) remain unchanged except for `array`.

Given:
- `array` was initially derived from `data[index:index + n]`
- `data` is a list of strings
- `t` is an integer equal to the previous `t` minus 1
- `index` is `3 + int(data[1])`
- `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`
- `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`
- `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`

After the execution of the code snippet:
- `array` is now the list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the previous `t` minus 1; `index` is `3 + int(data[1])`; `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`; `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**
