Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **data**: A list of strings where `int(data[0])` must be greater than 0.
   - `data[0]` is the number of elements in the `results` list.
   - `data[1]` to `data[3*int(data[0])]` are other relevant data points used in the calculation of `index`.

2. **t**: Initialized to 0. (This variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so it can be ignored for this task.)

3. **index**: Calculated as `1 + sum(int(data[i]) for i in range(1, 1 + 3*int(data[0])) if i % (int(data[i]) + 1) == 1)`.
   - This formula sums up `int(data[i])` for indices `i` in the range from 1 to `3*int(data[0])` (inclusive) where `i % (int(data[i]) + 1) == 1`.

4. **n**: Set to `int(data[index - 1])`.
   - `n` is the length of the sublist `array` taken from `data`.

5. **array**: A list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`.
   - This sublist is used as input for `func_1`.

6. **results**: A list containing `int(data[0])` elements, each being the output of `func_1(array)` for the corresponding iteration.
   - `results` has `int(data[0])` elements, each derived from applying `func_1` to different sublists of `data`.

7. **result**: The next element in `results`.
   - `result` is the value to be printed.

### Calculation of `index`

To determine `index`, we need to evaluate the sum:
\[ \text{index} = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{3 \cdot \text{int(data[0])}} \text{int(data[i])} \quad \text{if} \quad i \% (\text{int(data[i])} + 1) == 1 \]

### Calculation of `n`

Once `index` is determined:
\[ n = \text{int(data[index - 1])} \]

### Calculation of `array`

\[ \text{array} = \text{data[index:index + n]} \]

### Calculation of `results`

For each iteration, `func_1(array)` is called, and the result is stored in `results`.

### Final Output

The `print(result)` statement prints the next element in the `results` list.

### Output Format

Since we do not have the exact values of `data`, `index`, `n`, `array`, and `results`, we can only describe the value of `result` in terms of the given information.

Output: **result (where result is the next element in the results list, each element of which is the output of func_1(array) for the corresponding iteration)**
