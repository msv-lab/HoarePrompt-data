Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is 1; `index` is `4 + int(data[1]) + n + n`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being `result` and the second being the newly appended `result`; `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)` and has been updated to the new value returned by `func_1(array)`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `result` has been updated to the new value returned by `func_1(array)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
