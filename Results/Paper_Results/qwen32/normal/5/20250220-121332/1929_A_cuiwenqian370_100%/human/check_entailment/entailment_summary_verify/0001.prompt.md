You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it computes and prints the result of `func_1` applied to a list of integers. The input consists of the number of test cases followed by the length and elements of each list. The final state of the program is that it has printed the result for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The problem requires maximizing the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements of the array. To maximize this sum, we need to arrange the elements of the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

One way to achieve this is by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. When the array is sorted, the differences between consecutive elements are maximized compared to any other arrangement. This is because the smallest element will be at the start, and the largest will be at the end, thus maximizing the absolute difference.

Let's analyze the given program:
- `func_1(array)`: This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. Since the array is sorted, this function correctly calculates the maximum beauty.
- `func_2()`: This function handles input reading and output writing. It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements, calls `func_1` to calculate the beauty, and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

The logic in both functions is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
