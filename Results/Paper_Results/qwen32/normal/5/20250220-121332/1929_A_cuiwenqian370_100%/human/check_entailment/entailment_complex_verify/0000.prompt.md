You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it computes and prints the result of `func_1` applied to a list of integers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine the maximum beauty of an array `a` by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:

1. `func_1(array)`: This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the array. Sorting the array in either ascending or descending order will maximize the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is because the largest differences will be between the smallest and largest elements, and these differences will be maximized when the array is sorted.

2. **Calculating the Beauty**:
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after sorting. This approach ensures that the differences are maximized, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the beauty.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results. This matches the problem description which specifies multiple test cases.

### Edge Cases:
- **All Elements the Same**: If all elements in the array are the same, the beauty will be 0, as the differences between consecutive elements will be 0.
- **Two Elements**: For an array with only two elements, the beauty is simply the absolute difference between the two elements.
- **Largest and Smallest Elements**: The sorting ensures that the largest and smallest elements are placed at the extremes, maximizing the beauty.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. It handles multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program sorts the array to maximize the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements, which correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array as per the problem description. It also handles multiple test cases appropriately.
