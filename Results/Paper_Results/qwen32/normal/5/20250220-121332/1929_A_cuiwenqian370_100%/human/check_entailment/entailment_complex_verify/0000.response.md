### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the provided program and its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine the maximum beauty of an array `a` by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} |a_i - a_{i-1}|\).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:

1. **`func_1(array)`**:
   - **Functionality**: Sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Annotations**:
     - Before the function call, `array` is a list of integers with length `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), and each integer in the array satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
     - After sorting, `array` is a sorted list of integers, and `beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in the sorted array.
     - The function returns the beauty, which is the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in the sorted list.

2. **`func_2()`**:
   - **Functionality**: Reads input from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
   - **Annotations**:
     - The function reads input from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and processes each test case.
     - For each test case, it extracts the length of the array and the array elements, calls `func_1` to compute the beauty, and stores the result.
     - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

#### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - **Logic**: Sorting the array in either ascending or descending order will maximize the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is because the largest differences will be between the smallest and largest elements, and these differences will be maximized when the array is sorted.
   - **Implementation**: The function `func_1` sorts the array using `array.sort()`, which sorts the array in ascending order. The beauty is then calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that `array` is sorted and `beauty` is calculated correctly.

2. **Calculating the Beauty**:
   - **Logic**: The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after sorting. This approach ensures that the differences are maximized, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the beauty.
   - **Implementation**: The function iterates through the sorted array and sums the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that `beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in the sorted array.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - **Logic**: The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results. This matches the problem description which specifies multiple test cases.
   - **Implementation**: The function reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by extracting the length and elements of the array, calling `func_1` to compute the beauty, and storing the result.
   - **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that `results` is a list containing the output of `func_1` for each test case, and the results are printed correctly.

#### Edge Cases:
- **All Elements the Same**: If all elements in the array are the same, the beauty will be 0, as the differences between consecutive elements will be 0. This is correctly handled by the program.
- **Two Elements**: For an array with only two elements, the beauty is simply the absolute difference between the two elements. This is correctly handled by the program.
- **Largest and Smallest Elements**: The sorting ensures that the largest and smallest elements are placed at the extremes, maximizing the beauty. This is correctly handled by the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. It handles multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
**Final: True**

The program is correct and accurately computes the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.
