### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, by rearranging the elements. The key insight is that the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in either ascending or descending order. This is because sorting maximizes the differences between consecutive elements.

Let's break down the provided code to ensure it meets the problem requirements:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - **Input**: A list of integers `array` with length `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), and each integer in the array satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
    - **Process**: The function sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
    - **Output**: The function returns the calculated beauty of the array.
    - **Correctness**: Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the beauty of the array.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - **Input**: Reads from standard input, which consists of the number of test cases followed by the length and elements of each test case's array.
    - **Process**: For each test case, it reads the array, calls `func_1` to calculate the beauty, and stores the result.
    - **Output**: After processing all test cases, it prints the results.
    - **Correctness**: The function correctly reads multiple test cases, processes each one by calling `func_1`, and prints the results as specified.

3. **Execution Flow**:
    - The program starts by calling `func_2` if it is the main module.
    - `func_2` handles input reading and output printing, delegating the calculation of beauty to `func_1`.
    - `func_1` handles the core logic of sorting the array and computing the beauty.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and computing the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. It handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
