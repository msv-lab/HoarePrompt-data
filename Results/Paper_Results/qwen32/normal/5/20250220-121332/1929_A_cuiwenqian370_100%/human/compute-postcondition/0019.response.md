The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer equal to the previous `t` minus 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Let's adjust `t` accordingly. If `t` was 1 at the end of the last iteration, it would be 0 now, and the loop would terminate. Therefore, `t` must have been at least 2 at the end of the last iteration to allow for another iteration.

State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the previous `t` minus 1 but adjusted to be at least 2; `index` is `3 + int(data[1]) + n`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being `result` and the second being the newly appended `result`; `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**

To make it more precise, if `t` was 2 at the end of the last iteration, it would be 1 now, allowing for one more iteration.

State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is 1; `index` is `3 + int(data[1]) + n`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being `result` and the second being the newly appended `result`; `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**
