To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the effect of each iteration on the variables involved.

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `a` and `b` from the input, checks if their sum is even or odd, and prints either "Bob" or "Alice" based on the result.

Here's a summary of the process:
1. The loop iterates `t` times.
2. In each iteration, it reads a new pair of integers `a` and `b`.
3. It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even.
4. If the sum is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice".

After all `t` iterations, the loop terminates, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `s` reflect the values from the last iteration. However, the total number of iterations `t` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final output state after all iterations will be the state where:
- `i` has reached `t` (the loop has completed all iterations).
- `a` and `b` hold the values from the last iteration.
- `s` holds the last input string.
- `t` remains the same as initially given.

However, since the question asks for the output state, which is the result printed by the loop, the final output state will be the sequence of "Bob" or "Alice" printed for each iteration.

Since the output state is determined by the sequence of inputs, and not by the final values of `a`, `b`, `s`, or `t`, we can describe the final output state as the sequence of outputs from each iteration.

If we denote the outputs of each iteration as a sequence of "Bob" or "Alice", the final output state would be the concatenation of these outputs.

For the sake of the format requested, we will describe the output state in terms of the final values of the variables involved in the loop, which are `a`, `b`, `s`, and `i`. However, the actual output is the sequence of "Bob" or "Alice" printed.

Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times. The final values of `a` and `b` are from the last iteration. `s` is the last input string. `i` is equal to `t`. The output consists of `t` lines, each either "Bob" or "Alice" based on the sum of `a` and `b` in each iteration.**

To summarize in the requested format:
Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and the final output is a sequence of `t` lines, each either "Bob" or "Alice" based on the sum of `a` and `b` in each iteration.**
