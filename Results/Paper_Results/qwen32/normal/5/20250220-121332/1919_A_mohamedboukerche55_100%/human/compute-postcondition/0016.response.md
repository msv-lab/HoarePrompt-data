Postcondition: **`s` is the new input string; `a` is the integer value of the first element in the new input string `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second element in the new input string `s`; `t` is greater than `i + 1`; the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the code follows the if part. Otherwise, it follows the else part. In both cases, the values of `s`, `a`, `b`, `t`, and `i` retain their initial states with respect to the conditions given.**
