### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the winner of a game based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The game rules indicate that both players will play optimally. The key to solving the problem lies in understanding the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins (a + b).

The strategy is as follows:
- If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will win.
- If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice will win.

The reasoning behind this strategy is:
- When the total number of coins is even, Alice always leaves an odd number of coins after her turn, and Bob can always leave an even number of coins after his turn. Eventually, when there is only 1 coin left, it will be Alice's turn to take it, leaving Bob with no coins and thus Bob wins.
- When the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always leave an even number of coins after her first turn, and Bob will always be left with an odd number of coins after his turn. Eventually, when there is only 1 coin left, it will be Bob's turn to take it, leaving Alice with no coins and thus Alice wins.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of coins in each test case and printing the winner accordingly.
