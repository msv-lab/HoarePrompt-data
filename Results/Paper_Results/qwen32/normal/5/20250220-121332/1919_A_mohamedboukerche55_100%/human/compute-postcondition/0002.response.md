The code provided reads an input string and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `s` now holds the input string, while `a`, `b`, and `t` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`a` is any integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is any integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is the input string.**
