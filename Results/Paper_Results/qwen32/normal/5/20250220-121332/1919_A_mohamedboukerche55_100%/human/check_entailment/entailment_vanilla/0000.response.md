To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the problem and the reasoning behind the solution.

### Game Analysis:
1. **Objective**: The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
2. **Turns**: Players take turns, with Alice starting first.
3. **Actions in Each Turn**:
   - Swap wallets or keep the current one.
   - Remove 1 coin from the current wallet.
4. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally.

### Key Insight:
The game can be analyzed based on the total number of coins (a + b) in both wallets:
- **Even Total Coins**: If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins.
- **Odd Total Coins**: If the total number of coins is odd, Alice wins.

#### Explanation:
- **Even Total Coins (a + b) % 2 == 0**: In this scenario, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. If Alice swaps, Bob swaps; if Alice takes a coin, Bob takes a coin. Since the total is even, Bob will always have a move after Alice, ensuring Bob wins.
- **Odd Total Coins (a + b) % 2 != 0**: In this scenario, Alice can force Bob into a losing position. Alice can ensure that after her moves, Bob is left with an even total number of coins, making it impossible for Bob to always mirror Alice's moves effectively.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then checks if the total number of coins is even or odd and prints "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic based on the total number of coins being even or odd, which determines the winner under optimal play. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
