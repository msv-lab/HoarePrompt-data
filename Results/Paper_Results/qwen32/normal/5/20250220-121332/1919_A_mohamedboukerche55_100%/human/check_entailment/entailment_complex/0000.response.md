### Reasoning:
To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the game mechanics and the optimal strategies for both players. The key observation here is based on the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins \( a + b \).

1. **Game Analysis**:
    - If the total number of coins \( a + b \) is **odd**, Alice can always force Bob to face a situation where the remaining coins are even after his turn. This is because Alice can always ensure that the parity of the total coins switches with each of her turns.
    - Conversely, if the total number of coins \( a + b \) is **even**, Bob can always force Alice to face a situation where the remaining coins are odd after her turn. This is because Bob can always ensure that the parity of the total coins switches with each of his turns.

2. **Winning Strategy**:
    - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always make the last valid move, ensuring that Bob is left with no valid moves.
    - If the total number of coins is even, Bob can always make the last valid move, ensuring that Alice is left with no valid moves.

3. **Program Analysis**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
    - For each test case, it reads two integers \( a \) and \( b \).
    - It calculates the sum \( a + b \).
    - It checks the parity of the sum:
        - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
        - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

The program's logic correctly implements the winning strategy based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.
