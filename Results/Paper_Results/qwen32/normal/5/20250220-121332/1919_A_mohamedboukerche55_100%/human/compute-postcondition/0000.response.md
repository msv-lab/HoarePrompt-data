The code snippet provided reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

Since the code only reads the number of test cases and does not process the actual test cases, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged and are still described as two integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) for each test case. The variable `t` is now assigned the value of the input integer.

Output State: **Each test case contains two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively; `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
