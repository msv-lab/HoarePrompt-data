The `print('Alice')` statement will output the string 'Alice' regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `t`, and `s` as long as the conditions described in the initial state are met. The conditions (such as `a` and `b` being derived from the input string `s`, `t` being greater than or equal to 1, and the sum of `a` and `b` not being even) do not affect what is printed by this specific `print` statement.

Output: **Alice**
