Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. For each test case, if `a` is greater than `b`, the function returns "Alice"; if `b` is greater than `a`, the function returns "Bob"; if `a` is equal to `b`, the function returns "Tie". This process is repeated for `t` test cases.**
