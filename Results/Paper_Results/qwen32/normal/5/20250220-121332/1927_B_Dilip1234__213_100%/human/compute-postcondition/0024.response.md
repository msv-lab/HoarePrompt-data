The code snippet provided increments the value at index `j` of the `char_count` list by 1. Given that `j` is 0, this means the element at index 0 of `char_count` is incremented by 1 again.

Initial State: 
- `s` contains two characters `chr(j + ord('a'))`
- `char_count` has exactly one element incremented by 1 at index `j`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `n` is unchanged
- `j` is 0

After executing `char_count[j] += 1`:
- The element at index `j` (which is 0) of `char_count` is incremented by 1 again.
- The values of `s`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` contains two characters `chr(j + ord('a'))`, `char_count` has exactly one element incremented by 2 at index `j`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, and `j` is 0.**
