Postcondition: **`s` contains a single character `chr(j + ord('a'))` if `char_count[j]` does not equal `a[i]`. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, `s` contains two characters `chr(j + ord('a'))`. `char_count` has exactly one element incremented by 1 if a match was not found, and incremented by 2 if a match was found, at index `j`. `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, and `j` is 0.**
