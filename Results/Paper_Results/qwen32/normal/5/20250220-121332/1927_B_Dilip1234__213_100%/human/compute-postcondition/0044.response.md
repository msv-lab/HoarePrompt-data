Postcondition: **`s` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' + character corresponding to `j` in the alphabet if `char_count[j] == a[i]`, with `char_count` having a 2 at index `j` and 1s elsewhere, `i` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s` and `char_count` remain unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged.**
