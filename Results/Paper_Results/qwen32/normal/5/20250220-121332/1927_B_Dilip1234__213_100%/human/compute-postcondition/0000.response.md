The code snippet provided initializes a variable `s` as an empty string. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `a` as they are not modified by the given code. The only change is the initialization of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. It is guaranteed that for the given trace, there exists a suitable string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z. `s` is an empty string.**
