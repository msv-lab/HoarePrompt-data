Postcondition: **`s` contains a single character `chr(j + ord('a'))` followed by `'c'` if `char_count[j]` does not equal `a[i]`. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, `s` contains two characters `chr(j + ord('a'))` followed by `'b'`, followed by `'c'`. `char_count` has exactly one element incremented by 1 if a match was not found, and incremented by 2 if a match was found, at index `j`. Now, `char_count[2]` is incremented by 1. `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, and `j` is 2. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
