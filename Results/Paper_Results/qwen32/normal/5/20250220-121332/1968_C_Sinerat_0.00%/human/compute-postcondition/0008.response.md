The given code snippet updates the `i`-th element of the list `a` based on the previous element and the corresponding element in the list `x`. Specifically, `a[i]` is set to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

Given the initial state, we know that `a[0]` is 500, and for `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is initially defined as `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. However, the code snippet provided only updates `a[i]` for a specific `i` that is already incremented by 1 outside of the snippet.

Since the code snippet only updates `a[i]` and does not affect `t`, `n`, `x`, or the other elements of `a` (except for the specific `i`), the only change is in the value of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` except `a[i]` is now `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1.** 

In simpler terms, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, and `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables and list elements remain unchanged.
