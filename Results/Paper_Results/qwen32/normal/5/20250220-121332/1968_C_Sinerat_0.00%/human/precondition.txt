x is a list of lists, where each sublist contains n-1 integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the elements x_2, x_3, ..., x_n for each test case, and the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Each integer in the sublists satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
