The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the loop statement, the loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` remains the same since it is the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

However, to be more precise, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

To be more specific, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3.
