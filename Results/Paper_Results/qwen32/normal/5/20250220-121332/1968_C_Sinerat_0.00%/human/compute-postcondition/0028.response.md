The code snippet `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `x`. This means the previous list stored in `x` is replaced by the new list of integers obtained from the input.

Given the initial state, the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`) remain unchanged. The only change is that `x` is now the list of integers provided by the user.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the first element is 500, the `i`-th element is the sum of 500 and the first `i-1` elements of `x`, and the rest are set to 0 if not yet modified; `_` is 1; `i` is `n`.**
