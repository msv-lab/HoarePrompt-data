The code snippet `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the `i`-th element of the list `a` by adding the `(i-1)`-th element of `a` with the `(i-1)`-th element of `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`
- `i` is `i + 1`

The line `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` modifies the `i`-th element of `a` based on the previous element of `a` and the corresponding element of `x`. This means the value of `a[i]` is updated to be the sum of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `a[i]` is now `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simple terms, the `i`-th element of `a` has been updated to be the sum of the previous element of `a` and the corresponding element of `x`, and `i` has been incremented by 1. All other conditions and values remain the same.
