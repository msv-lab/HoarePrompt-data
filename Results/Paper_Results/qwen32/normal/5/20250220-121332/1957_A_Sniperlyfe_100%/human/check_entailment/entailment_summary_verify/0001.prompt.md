You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 3 for v in freq.values()))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers where the first element indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer representing the number of sticks followed by the lengths of those sticks. The function calculates and returns the total number of groups of three sticks that can be formed from all test cases, considering each unique stick length.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons that can be constructed using given sticks, where:
- Each polygon must have equal sides.
- Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick.
- No stick can be used in more than one polygon.

### Key Points
- To form a regular polygon, the number of sticks used must be at least 3 (the minimum number of sides for a polygon is 3).
- For a given stick length, the maximum number of polygons that can be formed is determined by the integer division of the count of sticks of that length by 3 (since each polygon requires at least 3 sticks of the same length).

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of a main loop that reads input for each test case and calls a function `func_1` to compute the result for each test case. Here's a breakdown of `func_1`:

1. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function creates a dictionary `freq` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It iterates through the list of stick lengths and updates the count for each length in the dictionary.

2. **Polygon Count Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the sum of integer divisions of the counts by 3.
   - This sum represents the maximum number of polygons that can be formed using the sticks.

### Correctness of the Program

The program is incorrect because it assumes that the only polygons that can be formed are triangles (3-sided polygons). However, the problem statement allows for polygons with any number of sides (at least 3).

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```
(We can form two squares, each with side length 2.)

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
2
```
(The program correctly outputs 2 for this case, but this is not a sufficient test for correctness.)

However, consider another test case:

**Input:**
```
1
6
3 3 3 3 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```
(We can form two equilateral triangles, each with side length 3.)

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
2
```
(The program correctly outputs 2 for this case as well, but this is still not sufficient.)

The problem arises when we have more than 3 sticks of the same length and can form polygons with more than 3 sides. For example:

**Input:**
```
1
9
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```
(We can form three triangles, each with side length 2.)

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
3
```
(The program correctly outputs 3 for this case, but this is still not sufficient.)

However, if we consider a case where we can form polygons with more than 3 sides:

**Input:**
```
1
9
3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```
(We can form three triangles, each with side length 3, or one hexagon and one triangle, etc.)

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
3
```
(The program correctly outputs 3 for this case, but this is still not sufficient.)

The issue is that the program only considers forming triangles and does not account for the possibility of forming polygons with more than 3 sides. Therefore, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
