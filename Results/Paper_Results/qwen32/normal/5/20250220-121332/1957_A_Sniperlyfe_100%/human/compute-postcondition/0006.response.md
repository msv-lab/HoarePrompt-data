The code snippet `freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1` increments the count of the value `n` in the dictionary `freq` by 1. If `n` is not already a key in the dictionary, it is added with a count of 1.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers with at least three elements.
- `t` (the first element of `arr`) is the number of test cases, and `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`.
- `n` is the third element in the list `arr`.
- `freq` is a dictionary with the count of the previous `n` incremented by 1.

After the execution of the code, the count of `n` in the `freq` dictionary will be incremented by 1. The values of `arr` and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least three elements where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, `n` is the third element in the list, and `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `n` incremented by 1.**
