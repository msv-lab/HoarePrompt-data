To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all possible iterations, we need to consider the behavior of the loop:

The loop `while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:` increments `i` as long as the current element `arr[i]` is equal to the next element `arr[i + 1]`. This means the loop will continue to run as long as there are consecutive equal elements starting from the beginning of the list.

The loop stops when either:
1. `i` reaches the second-to-last index of the list (`i < len(arr) - 1` fails), or
2. `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

Given the initial conditions and the behavior of the loop, after all iterations, `i` will be positioned at the first index where the value of the element is different from the previous one, or it will reach the second-to-last index if all elements are the same.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `i` will be the index of the first element that is different from the previous one, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are the same.
- `n` (the length of `arr`) remains unchanged.
- `j` (which is `len(arr) - 1`) remains unchanged.

If all elements in the list are the same, `i` will be `len(arr) - 1` after the loop finishes.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `i` is the index of the first element that is different from the previous one or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are the same, `n` is the length of `arr`, and `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.**
