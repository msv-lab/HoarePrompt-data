The value of `j` is decremented by 1. Since `j` was initially `len(arr) - 1`, after the decrement, `j` becomes `len(arr) - 2`. The other variables (`arr`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements where the last two elements are equal, `i` is the index of the first element that is different from the previous one or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are the same, `n` is the length of `arr`, and `j` is `len(arr) - 2`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements where the last two elements are equal, `i` is the index of the first element that is different from the previous one or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are the same, `n` is the length of `arr`, and `j` is `len(arr) - 2`.**
