The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially 0, it is now 1. The other variables `arr`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0] == arr[1]`, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `arr` and `n > 1`, `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0] == arr[1]`, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `arr` and `n > 1`, `j` is `len(arr) - 1`**
