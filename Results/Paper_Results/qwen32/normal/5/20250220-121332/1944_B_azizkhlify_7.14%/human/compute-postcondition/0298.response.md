Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.
- `res` contains up to `k` elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` if `k` is non-zero.
- `i` is set to `n + 2`.
- `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true, multiplied by 2.
- `a` remains the same.
- `l` reflects the counts of each element in `a`.
- `r` remains the same.
- `re` is equal to `k` if `k` is non-zero.
- If `ul == ur`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is printing the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.
- From the initial state, we know that `i` is set to `n + 2`.

### Determining the Output:
- The value of `a[i]` will be the element at index `n + 2` in the list `a`.
- Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `a[n + 2]`.
- However, we can describe the output in terms of the list `a` and the index `n + 2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[n + 2] a[n + 2] (where a[n + 2] is the element at index n + 2 in the list a)**
