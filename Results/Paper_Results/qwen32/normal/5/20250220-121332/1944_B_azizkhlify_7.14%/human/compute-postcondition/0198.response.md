Postcondition: **`res` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the last element of `res` plus 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `ul` is not equal to `ur` if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2. Otherwise, `ul` retains its original value relative to `ur`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.**
