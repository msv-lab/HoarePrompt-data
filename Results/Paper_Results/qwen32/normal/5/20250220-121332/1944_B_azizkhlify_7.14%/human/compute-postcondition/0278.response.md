To determine the output of the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n` and `k`**: These variables remain unchanged and their specific values are not provided, so we cannot determine their exact values.
2. **`res`**: This list contains at least one element from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` if `k` is non-zero. This means `res` contains indices (or values from `a`) that have a count of 1 in the list `l`.
3. **`i`**: This variable is the next element in `res` that has not been processed. It is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we know it is an element from `res`.
4. **`ul`**: This variable is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true, multiplied by 2. This information is not directly relevant to the value of `i`.
5. **`a`**: This list remains unchanged and its specific values are not provided, so we cannot determine its exact values.
6. **`l`**: This list reflects the counts of each element in `a`. For example, if `a` contains the element `x`, then `l[x - 1]` gives the count of `x` in `a`.
7. **`r`**: This variable remains unchanged and its specific value is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value.
8. **`re`**: This variable is equal to `k` if `k` is non-zero. If `k` is zero, the value of `re` is not specified, but it is not relevant to the value of `i`.

### Analysis:
The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space. The variable `i` is described as the next element in `res` that has not been processed. Since `res` contains elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` if `k` is non-zero, `i` is an element from `a` that has a count of 1 in `l`.

### Output:
Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe it based on the given information. The value of `i` is an element from `res`, and `res` contains elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` if `k` is non-zero.

Output: **i (where i is the next element in res that has not been processed, and res contains elements from a where l[a[i] - 1] == 1 if k is non-zero)**
