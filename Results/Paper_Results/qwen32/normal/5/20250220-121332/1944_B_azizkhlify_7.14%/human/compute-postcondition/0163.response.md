To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided:

1. **Variable `a`**: The variable `a` is a list of integers from the input. The exact elements of `a` are not specified, but we know that it contains at least two elements because `l` is defined as a list of 2 elements where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of the integer `j+1` in the list `a`.

2. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2. This means that the `print` statement will print the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

3. **Index 2 of `a`**: Since `i` is 2, the `print` statement will output `a[2]`. However, the exact value of `a[2]` is not provided in the initial state. We only know that `a` is a list of integers and that it has at least two elements.

Given this information, we can conclude that the output will be the third element of the list `a` (since list indices start from 0).

Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list `a`)**
