Postcondition: **`t` is a variable, `ul` is either `k * 2` or `k * 2 + 2 * (count of elements with count 2 in the first two elements of `a`)`, `ur` is 0, `n` is 2, `k` is either 0 or `-2 * (count of elements with count 2 in the first two elements of `a`)`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `l` is a list of 2 elements where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of the integer `j+1` in the list `a`, `r` is `[0, 1]`. If `k` is not 0, then `i` is 1, `re` is the count of elements in the first two elements of `a` that occur exactly once, and `res` is a list containing those elements that occur exactly once in the first two elements of `a`. Otherwise, `i`, `re`, and `res` retain their initial values.**
