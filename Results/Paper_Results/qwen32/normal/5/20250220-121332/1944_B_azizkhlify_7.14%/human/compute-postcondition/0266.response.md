To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and understand the relationships between the variables.

### Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `k` is a non-zero value and `k` is defined as `2 * k - ul`.
   - `res` is a list that contains `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, otherwise it remains an empty list.
   - `i` is initialized to 2.
   - `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true multiplied by 2, up to the point where the loop breaks if `ul` equals `k * 2`.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `l` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `a[i] - 1` which is now the number of times `a[i]` appears in `a`.
   - `r` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a[n:2*n]`.
   - `re` is 1 if `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, otherwise it remains 0. If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement breaks.

2. **Key Variables**:
   - `a[i]`: This is the element in the list `a` at index `i`. Given `i` is initialized to 2, `a[i]` is the third element of the list `a`.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]`: This is the value in the list `l` at the index `a[i] - 1`. The value at this index indicates how many times `a[i]` appears in `a`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Explanation:

- The statement `print(a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[i]` followed by a space.
- Since `i` is initialized to 2, `a[i]` refers to the third element in the list `a`.

### Output:
The output will be the third element of the list `a` followed by a space.

Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list `a`)**
