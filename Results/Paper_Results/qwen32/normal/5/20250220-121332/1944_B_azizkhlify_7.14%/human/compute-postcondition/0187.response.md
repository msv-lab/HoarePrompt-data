The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only terminates the innermost loop or switch statement it is contained within. Therefore, the values of `res`, `i`, `n`, and `ul` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the last element of `res`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ul` is equal to `ur`.**
