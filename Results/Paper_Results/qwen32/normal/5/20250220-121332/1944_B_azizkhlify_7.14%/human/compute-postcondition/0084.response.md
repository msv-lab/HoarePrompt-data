Postcondition: **`t`, `ul`, and `ur` are defined with `ul` not equal to `ur` before entering the if condition, but now `ul` equals `ur`. `n` is at least 1. If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, `ur` is increased by 2; otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged. Since `ul == ur` is true, `ul` and `ur` have the same value.**
