To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 0.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2. This implies that `l[a[0] - 1]` equals 2. Therefore, the value at index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 2.

However, the initial state does not provide the explicit value of `a[0]` or the list `a`. We only know that `a[0]` is such that `l[a[0] - 1]` equals 2. To proceed, we need to focus on what is printed by the `print` statement.

The `print` statement prints `a[i]` twice, with `i` being 0. Therefore, it prints `a[0]` twice, separated by a space, and does not add a newline at the end due to `end=' '`.

Since the exact value of `a[0]` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `a[0]`.

Output: **a[0] a[0] (where a[0] is the first element of the list `a`)**
