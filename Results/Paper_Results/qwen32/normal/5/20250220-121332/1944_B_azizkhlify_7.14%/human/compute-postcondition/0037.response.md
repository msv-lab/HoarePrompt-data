To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 5000.
- `n` is an integer that is at least 1.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `l` is a list where the i-th element represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i+1` in the list `a`.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers.
- `re` is initialized to 0.
- `ul` is set to 4 if the i-th element of `a` satisfies `l[a[i] - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ul` is set to 2.
- `ur` is initialized to 0.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (presumably in a loop context).

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

This statement will print the element at index `i` in the list `a` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline character at the end.

### Determining the Output:
- The value of `a[i]` depends on the list `a` and the current value of `i`.
- Since the exact values of `a` and `i` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the element at index `i` of the list `a`, printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i of the list a)**
