The code snippet `ul += 2` increments the value of `ul` by 2. Given the initial state, `ul` is either 2 or 4. After adding 2, `ul` will be either 4 or 6.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that n >= 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list where the i-th element is the count of occurrences of integer i+1 in the list `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 4 or 6, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is incremented by 1.**
