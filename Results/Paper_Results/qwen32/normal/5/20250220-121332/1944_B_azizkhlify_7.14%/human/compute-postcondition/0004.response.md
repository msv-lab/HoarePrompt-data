The code snippet creates a new list `r` with `n` zeros. The initial state indicates that `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` and `k` are integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers, and `l` is a list of `n` zeros. After executing the code, `r` is also a list of `n` zeros.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values from the input line to integers; `l` is a list of `n` zeros; `r` is a list of `n` zeros.**
