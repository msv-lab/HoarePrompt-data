Postcondition: **`t` is a variable, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `n` is 2, `k` is the second input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `l` is a list of 2 elements where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of the integer `j+1` in the list `a`. The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, indicating that the integer `a[i]` appears exactly twice in the list `a`. `r` is [0, 1], `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list.**
