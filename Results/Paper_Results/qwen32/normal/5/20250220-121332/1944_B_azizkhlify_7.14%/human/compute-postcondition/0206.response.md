The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each of these elements to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `res`, `i`, `ul`, or `ur`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `res` is a list (unchanged), `i` is the last element of `res` (unchanged), `ul` is unchanged, `ur` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers from the input.**
