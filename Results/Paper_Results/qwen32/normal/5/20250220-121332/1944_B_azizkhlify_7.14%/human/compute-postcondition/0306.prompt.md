Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= floor(n/2). The array a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t`, `ul`, and `ur` are variables. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `ur` is updated to its initial value plus `2 * k`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ul` or `ur`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop prints all elements in `res` separated by spaces, and `i` is the last element of `res`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `i` is `2*n - 1` unless the loop breaks due to `ul` equaling `ur`. During the iterations, `ur` is incremented by 2 for every iteration where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, and `ul` remains unchanged unless it equals `ur`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` remains the same; `k` remains the same; `res` contains up to `k` elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` if `k` is non-zero; `i` is either the value at which the loop broke or `2 * n` if it did not break; `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true, multiplied by 2; `a` remains the same; `l` reflects the counts of each element in `a`; `r` remains the same; `re` is equal to `k` if `k` is non-zero; if `ul != ur`, then `ur` could be different from `ul` if the loop completed all iterations, otherwise `ur` is equal to `ul`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
