Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0; `k` is a non-zero value and `k` is `2 * k - ul`; `res` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true multiplied by 2, up to the point where the loop breaks if `ul` equals `k * 2`; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `l` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `a[i] - 1` which is now the number of times `a[i]` appears in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a[n:2*n]`; `re` is 0; the current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.**
