The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since the provided code snippet does not contain any loop structure, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program. Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`) are modified.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` with all occurrences of `a1` removed.**
