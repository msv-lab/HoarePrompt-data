Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the situation step-by-step:

1. **Variables and Lists**:
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10,000.
   - `n`: An integer greater than or equal to 2.
   - `m`: An integer read from the input, explicitly set to 2.
   - `a1`: The first integer from the first input line.
   - `l1`: A list of integers from the first input line following `a1`.
   - `a2`: The first integer from the new input line.
   - `l2`: A list of integers from the new input line following `a2`.
   - `l11`: A list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`.
   - `l22`: A list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`.
   - `i`: The value of `n-2` or the index where the loop broke early.
   - `idx1` and `idx2`: Indices where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` or `-1` if no such pair is found.
   - `p1` and `p2`: `1` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` was encountered, otherwise `0`.
   - `val`: An empty list.
   - The condition `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2` is given.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('yes')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables or the state of the program. It simply prints the string `'yes'`.

4. **Output**:
   - Since the print statement is independent of the variable values and the state of the program, the output will always be `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
