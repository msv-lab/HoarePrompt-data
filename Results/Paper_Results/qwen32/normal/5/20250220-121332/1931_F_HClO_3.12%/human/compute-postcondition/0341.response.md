Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged unless `m` was 2 in which case `m` becomes 1, `a1` and `a2` remain the same, `l2` has `a2` inserted at `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`, `l22` remains the same unless `a2` was inserted into `l2` in the else part, `idx1` is incremented by 1 if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise it remains the same, `idx2` is `idx2 + 1` if `idx1 < idx2`, otherwise it is reset to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1` if such a pair is found, otherwise it is -1, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, `val` is an empty list if `idx1 <= idx2`, otherwise `val` is a list containing an additional tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the first integer from the input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers. If `idx1 > idx2`, `l` becomes `l1`. If `idx1 <= idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index `idx2` and `l` becomes `l1`. Otherwise, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at index `idx1` and `l` becomes `l2`.**
