To determine what will be printed by the `print('no')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the conditions under which the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`: An integer greater than or equal to 2.
   - `m`: An integer read from the input, decreased by 1 if `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.
   - `a1`: The first integer from the first input line.
   - `l1`: A list of integers from the first input line following `a1`, with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` under certain conditions.
   - `a2`: The first integer from the new input line.
   - `l2`: A list of integers from the new input line following `a2`, with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` under certain conditions.
   - `l11`: A list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`.
   - `l22`: A list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`.
   - `i`: Set to `n-2` or the index where the loop broke early.
   - `idx1` and `idx2`: Indices where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` or `-1` if no such pair is found.
   - `p1` and `p2`: `1` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` was encountered, otherwise `0`.
   - `val`: A list containing at least two tuples `(a3, l3)`.
   - `a3`: The first integer from the input of each iteration.
   - `l3`: A list of the remaining integers from the input of each iteration.
   - `l`: A list equal to `l1` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2` with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` under certain conditions.
   - `_`: Equal to `m - 2` indicating all iterations have completed.
   - The loop breaks if `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all instances of `a3` removed.

2. **Conditions and Logic:**
   - The code seems to involve multiple iterations and comparisons between lists and their elements.
   - The `print('no')` statement is not preceded by any conditional statements that would prevent its execution, suggesting it is intended to be executed under certain circumstances.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:

- The `print('no')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any conditional checks or variable values.
- It will print the string `'no'` regardless of the state of other variables or the results of previous computations.

### Conclusion:

Given the initial state and the structure of the provided code snippet, the `print('no')` statement will output the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
