The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` at the position `idx1` in the list `l2`. This operation changes the content of `l2` by adding one element at the specified index.

Given the initial state, `idx1` is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` if such a pair is found. If such a pair is not found, `idx1` is -1. However, since we are performing an insertion, we assume that `idx1` is not -1 (otherwise, the insertion operation would not change `l2`).

After the insertion, `l2` will have an additional element, and its length will increase by 1. The elements after `idx1` will be shifted to the right to accommodate the new element.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the same, `m` is 2 if the initial `m` was 2, otherwise `m` remains the same, `a1` is the same, `a2` is the same, `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l22` is the same, `idx1` and `idx2` are set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` if such a pair is found, otherwise they are -1, `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` were encountered, otherwise they are 0, and `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
