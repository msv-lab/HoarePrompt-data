Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 5, `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` with all occurrences of `a1` removed, `i` is 4, `idx2` is 4, `p2` is 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without modification to the variables.**

Explanation: The value of `p2` is set to 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
