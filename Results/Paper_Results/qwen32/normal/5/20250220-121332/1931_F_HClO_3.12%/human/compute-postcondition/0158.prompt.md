You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an else statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account that the program does not enter the if block and goes to the lese block instead. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement. WE DO NOT FOLLOW THE IF CONDITION IN THIS CASE. WE ENTER THE ELSE BLOCK.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after not entering the if block and instead enetering the else block . So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is false. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is more than or equal to 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` can have any value except an integer one`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive larger or equal to 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, a is a list of integers
if condition:
```
if n <=0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. n is larger than 0, a is a list of integers***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the first input line, `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`, `i` is 0, `idx1` and `idx2` are both -1, `p1` and `p2` are both 0, `val` is a list containing tuples `(a3, l3)` for each of the `m-2` iterations, `a3` is the first integer from the input of each iteration, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input of each iteration, `l` is a list equal to `l1` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2` with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3` or `a2` is not in `l3` or `a1` is not in `l3`, `_` is 1 if `l11 == l22`, otherwise `_` is `m-2`, the loop has not printed 'yes' or 'no' yet, if `m` is 1, the state remains the same as described above, if `m` is not 1 and `l11 != l22`, `m-3` additional input lines have been consumed. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Additionally, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`
if condition:
```
if (l1[i + p1] == a2):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition .All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the negation of the if condition must also be included. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it does not enter the if condition and instead enters the else. 
Provide the postcondition in Natural language easily understandable by humans. Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**
