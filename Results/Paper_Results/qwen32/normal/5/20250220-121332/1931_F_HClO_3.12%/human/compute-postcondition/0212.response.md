Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1` with `a1` inserted at the position `idx2`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2` (before the insertion); `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is `n-1`; `idx1` and `idx2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `val` is an empty list; `l` is a list of integers from `l1`; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a3`; the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.** 

The value of `l` has been updated to be equal to `l1`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
