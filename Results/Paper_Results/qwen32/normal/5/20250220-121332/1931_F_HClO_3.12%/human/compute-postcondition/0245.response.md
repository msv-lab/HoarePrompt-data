The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which represents the number of iterations the loop is supposed to execute. Since the loop has finished all its iterations, it means that `t` must have been 0 at the start of the last iteration, as the loop would not execute if `t` were 0.

To execute one more iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop has just finished, we need to reset `t` to 1 to allow for one more iteration.

State: **`t` is 1**
