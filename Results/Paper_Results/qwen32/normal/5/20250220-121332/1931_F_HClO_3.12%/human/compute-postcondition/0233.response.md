Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, we need to determine what will be printed when the `print('no')` statement executes.

Let's break down the provided initial state:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
2. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
3. `m` is an integer greater than 2.
4. `a1` is the first integer from the first input line.
5. `a2` is the first integer from the new input line.
6. `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`, with `a1` inserted at `idx2` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.
7. `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`, with `a2` inserted at `idx1` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a2` in `l3` is less than or equal to the index of `a1` in `l3`.
8. `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2` (before the insertion).
9. `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`.
10. `i` is `n-1`.
11. `idx1` and `idx2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`.
12. `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`.
13. `val` is a list containing at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`.
14. `l` is a list of integers from `l1` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers from `l2` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, or `l` is a list of integers from `l1` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.
15. `_` is `0` if `l11 == l22`, otherwise `_` is `1`.
16. `idx1` is less than `idx2` if `idx1` was less than `idx2` initially, otherwise `idx1` is not less than `idx2`.
17. The loop has not printed 'yes' or 'no' yet.
18. `a3` is the first integer from the new input line.
19. `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a3` for the last iteration.
20. The list `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all instances of `a3` removed.

The `print('no')` statement is straightforward. It prints the string 'no' regardless of the values of the variables described above. There is no condition or variable value that affects what gets printed by this statement.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **no**
