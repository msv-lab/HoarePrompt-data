The code snippet provided assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. Given that `i` is 5, `idx1` and `idx2` will both be 5. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 6, `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` with all occurrences of `a1` removed, `i` is 5, `idx1` is 5, `idx2` is 5, and if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
