The provided Python code snippet initializes two variables, `idx1` and `idx2`, to `-1`. No other operations are performed that would affect the initial state of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, or `l22`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1.**
