The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables; it simply moves the control back to the beginning of the loop for the next iteration.

Given the initial state, the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the same, `m` is 2, `a1` is the same, `a2` is the same, `l2` is the same, `l22` is the same, `idx1` and `idx2` are set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` if such a pair is found, otherwise they are -1, `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` were encountered, otherwise they are 0, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.**
