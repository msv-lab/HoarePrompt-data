The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'yes'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of these variables does not affect the output.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is described as an integer within the range 1 to 10,000. However, it is not used in the `print` statement.
2. The variables `n` and `m` are read from the input, but `n` is not used in the `print` statement. The variable `m` is explicitly set to 1, but this also does not affect the `print` statement.
3. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'yes'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
