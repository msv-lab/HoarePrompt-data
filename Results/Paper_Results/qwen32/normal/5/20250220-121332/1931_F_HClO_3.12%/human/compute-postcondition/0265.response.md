The code snippet provided initializes two variables, `idx1` and `idx2`, both to the value `-1`. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `-1` to `idx1` and `idx2`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` with all occurrences of `a1` removed, if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the condition holds true, otherwise, no specific action is taken regarding `l11` and `l22`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.**
