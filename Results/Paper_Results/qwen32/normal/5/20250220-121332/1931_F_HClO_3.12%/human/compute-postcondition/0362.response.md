Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

The initial state provides information about various variables and their values or states, but the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables or their values. The statement is:

```python
print('no')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'no'`. There are no variables or conditions that affect the output of this print statement. Therefore, the output is exactly what is specified in the `print` statement.

Output: **no**
