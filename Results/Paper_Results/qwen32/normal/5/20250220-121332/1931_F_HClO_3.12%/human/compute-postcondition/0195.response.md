To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given information about the first three iterations.

Here's the summary of the loop's behavior and the conditions provided:
1. The loop runs for `n-1` iterations.
2. It breaks early if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or if `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`.
3. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, it checks if either `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` and updates `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` accordingly.
4. If `idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0`, the loop breaks.

From the provided states after the first three iterations:
- After the first iteration: `i` is 0, `idx1` and `idx2` are set based on whether `l1[0] == a2` or `l2[0] == a1`.
- After the second iteration: `i` is 1, `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged if they were set in the first iteration, otherwise, they are set based on whether `l1[1 + p1] == a2` or `l2[1 + p2] == a1`.
- After the third iteration: `i` is 2, `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged if they were set in the first or second iteration, otherwise, they are set based on whether `l1[2 + p1] == a2` or `l2[2 + p2] == a1`.

Given these states, we can infer the following:
- The loop will continue to iterate until `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` is met.
- If `idx1` and `idx2` are set (i.e., `idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0`), the loop will break.
- If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` and neither `l1[i + p1] == a2` nor `l2[i + p2] == a1`, the loop will continue to the next iteration.

The final state after all iterations will be when either the loop breaks due to the conditions mentioned or completes all `n-1` iterations.

Let's consider the possible final states:
1. **Loop breaks early**: If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` is met before `n-1` iterations.
2. **Loop completes all iterations**: If none of the break conditions are met, the loop will complete `n-1` iterations.

Given the information, the most likely scenario is that the loop completes all `n-1` iterations if no early break conditions are met.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `m` remains the same.
- `a1` and `l1` remain the same.
- `a2` and `l2` remain the same.
- `l11` and `l22` remain the same.
- `i` will be `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations.
- `idx1` and `idx2` will be set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`.
- `p1` and `p2` will be set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`.
- `val` remains the same.
- `l` remains the same.
- `_` remains the same.
- The loop does not print 'yes' or 'no'.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is `n-1`; `idx1` and `idx2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `val` is a list containing tuples `(a3, l3)` for each of the `m-2` iterations; `a3` is the first integer from the input of each iteration; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input of each iteration; `l` is a list equal to `l1` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2` with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3` or `a2` is not in `l3` or `a1` is not in `l3`; `_` is 1 if `l11 == l22`, otherwise `_` is `m-2`. The loop has not printed 'yes' or 'no' yet.**

In simpler terms, the loop completes all `n-1` iterations, and the variables are updated based on the last iteration's conditions.
