Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `a1` and `a2` remain the same, `l2` and `l22` are updated based on the last iteration's conditions, `idx1` and `idx2` are updated based on the last iteration's conditions, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, `val` contains at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l` is updated based on the last iteration's conditions. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined as there is no else part.**
