### Reasoning:

The program attempts to solve the problem by calculating a product of multipliers (`prod`) for each test case. It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the product divided by the corresponding multiplier. The difference between the product and the sum of `vprod` is calculated as `den`. If `den` is less than or equal to zero, the program outputs `-1`, indicating no valid distribution is possible. Otherwise, it outputs the elements of `vprod`.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program's approach:

1. **Product Calculation**: The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`). This product can become very large, especially given the constraints (up to 50 multipliers each up to 20). This large product is then used to compute `vprod` by dividing it by each multiplier.

2. **Sum of `vprod`**: The sum of `vprod` is subtracted from `prod` to get `den`. If `den` is positive, the program outputs `vprod`. However, the values in `vprod` are not necessarily the bets that ensure the player comes out ahead in every possible winning scenario.

3. **Logical Error**: The key issue is that `vprod` does not guarantee that the total bet is strictly less than the return for each winning outcome. The program does not ensure that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the return for each outcome. Instead, it relies on the incorrect assumption that the specific calculation of `vprod` will always satisfy the conditions.

### Correctness:

Given the logical flaw described above, the program does not correctly solve the problem as intended. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
