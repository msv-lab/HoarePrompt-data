The code snippet `prod *= r` multiplies the current value of `prod` by the value of `r` and assigns the result back to `prod`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `N`, and `vals` remain unchanged as they are not directly involved in the operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20; `N` is an input integer; `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least two integers; `prod` is the current value of `r` multiplied by the previous value of `prod`; `r` is the next element in `vals`.**
