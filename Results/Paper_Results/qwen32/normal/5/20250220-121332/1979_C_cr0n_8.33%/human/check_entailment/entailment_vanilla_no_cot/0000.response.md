Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. Specifically, the calculation of `den` and the check `if den <= 0` do not guarantee the required condition.

Let's analyze the solution step by step:

1. The product `prod` is calculated as the product of all `k_i` values.
2. `vprod` is a list where each element is `prod // k_i`.
3. `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
4. If `den <= 0`, the solution outputs `-1`.

The issue with this approach is that `den` does not represent the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes minus the amount received back for any winning outcome. Instead, `den` is just the difference between the product of all multipliers and the sum of the partial products, which does not satisfy the problem's requirement.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that for each `i`, the total bet is strictly less than `k_i * x_i`. One way to do this is to set each `x_i` to a value that ensures the inequality holds, such as setting `x_i` to `1` for all but one outcome and adjusting the remaining outcome to satisfy the condition.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
cases = int(input())
for _ in range(cases):
    n = int(input().strip())
    k = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    
    # Find the minimum k
    min_k = min(k)
    min_k_index = k.index(min_k)
    
    # Set all bets to 1 except for the minimum k
    bets = [1] * n
    bets[min_k_index] = sum(k) - min_k
    
    # Check if the solution is valid
    total_bet = sum(bets)
    valid = True
    for i in range(n):
        if k[i] * bets[i] <= total_bet:
            valid = False
            break
    
    if valid:
        print(' '.join(map(str, bets)))
    else:
        print(-1)
```

This solution sets all bets to `1` except for the outcome with the smallest `k`, which is set to `sum(k) - min_k`. This ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
