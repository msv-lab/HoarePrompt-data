`den` is assigned the value of `prod - sum(vprod)`. The values of `prod`, `vprod`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `N`, and `vals` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`; `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`; `t`, `n`, `k`, `N`, and `vals` remain unchanged; `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`.**
