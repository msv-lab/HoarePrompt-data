The `print` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `prod`, `vprod`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `N`, or `vals` directly. It simply prints the integer `-1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `prod` variable is the product of all elements in the `vals` list.
2. The `vprod` list is derived by dividing `prod` by each element in `vals`.
3. The `den` variable is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)` and is specified to be less than or equal to 0.
4. The `print(-1)` statement is independent of these calculations and directly outputs the value `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
