The given code snippet is attempting to increment the count of the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. However, since `M` is initially an empty dictionary and `cur` is -1, this operation will result in a `KeyError` because the key `-1` does not exist in `M`.

Given the task constraints and the initial state, the code as written will not execute successfully due to the `KeyError`. However, if we assume the intention is to initialize the key if it does not exist, we can simulate that behavior.

Here's the corrected interpretation and output state:

If we assume the code should initialize the key if it does not exist:
```python
if cur in M:
    M[cur] += 1
else:
    M[cur] = 1
```

Given this assumption, the output state would be:

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `M` is a dictionary with the key `-1` having the value `1`, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is -1, and `num` is less than or equal to `cur`.**

In natural language: The dictionary `M` now contains the key `-1` with a value of `1`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state.
