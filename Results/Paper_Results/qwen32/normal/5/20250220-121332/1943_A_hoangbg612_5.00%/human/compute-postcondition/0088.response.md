The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. The other variables `M`, `S`, and `N` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their respective counts in `N`; `S` remains unchanged; `N` remains unchanged; `cur` is the last element in `N` plus 1.**
