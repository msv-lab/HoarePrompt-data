Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `S` is an input integer, and `cur` is either -1 or equal to `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur` (previously -1), `M` is a dictionary with the key `cur` and value `1`, and `cur` is updated to `num`. If `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, `M` is a dictionary with the key `-1` having the value `1`, and `cur` remains -1.**
