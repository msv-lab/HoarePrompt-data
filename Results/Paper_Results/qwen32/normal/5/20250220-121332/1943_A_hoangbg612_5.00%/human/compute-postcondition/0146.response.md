Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` (or up to the last number before a gap) and values as the count of consecutive occurrences, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is greater than 0. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, then `cur` is set to `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, and `cur` remain unchanged.**
