The code snippet provided assigns the value of `num` to the variable `cur`. This means the new value of `cur` will be whatever `num` was before the assignment. No other variables are altered in this snippet.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after `num_next`; `cur` is now equal to `num`.**
