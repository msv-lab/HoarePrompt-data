The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `cur` was -1, it becomes 0, and if `cur` was 0, it becomes 1. The values of `M`, `S`, `N`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`M` is a dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `cur` is either 0 or 1, and `num` is the next element in `N`.**
