To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior and conditions of the loop based on the provided initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations.

Given:
- The loop iterates `cur` times.
- For each `i` in the range of `cur`, if `M[i] <= i`, then `cur` is set to `i` and the loop breaks.
- Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `cur` is the highest number in `N` that is consecutively reachable starting from -1.
   - `M` contains the count of each reachable value.
   - If the sum of the counts of all values in `M` equals `S`, then `cur` is incremented by 1.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = cur - 1`.
   - If `M[i] <= i` for any `i`, `cur` is set to `i` and the loop breaks.
   - If no such `i` is found, `cur` remains unchanged.

3. **Output States After Iterations**:
   - After 1 iteration: `cur` must be greater than 0. If `M[0] <= 0`, `cur` is set to 0 and the loop breaks.
   - After 2 iterations: `cur` is the value of `i` if `M[i] <= i` for `i = 1`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.
   - After 3 iterations: `cur` is the value of `i` if `M[i] <= i` for `i = 2`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

To determine the final output state, we need to consider the condition that stops the loop. The loop will stop either when `M[i] <= i` for some `i` or when `i` reaches `cur - 1`.

The final state of `cur` will be the smallest `i` such that `M[i] <= i`, or it will remain unchanged if no such `i` is found within the range.

### Conclusion

The final output state is determined by the smallest `i` in the range `[0, cur-1]` such that `M[i] <= i`. If no such `i` exists, `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State: **The smallest `i` in the range `[0, cur-1]` such that `M[i] <= i`, or `cur` if no such `i` exists.**

In natural language: The final value of `cur` will be the smallest index `i` where the count `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. If no such index exists, `cur` remains the same as its initial value.
