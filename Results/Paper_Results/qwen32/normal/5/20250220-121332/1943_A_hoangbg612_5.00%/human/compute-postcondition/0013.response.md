The code assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. Since `num` is greater than `cur` and specifically greater than `cur + 1`, the condition that leads to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is met. However, the break statement itself is not present in the provided code snippet, so we only reflect the assignment in the output state.

Output State: **T is greater than or equal to 1, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; S is an input integer; N is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element; cur is `num`; M is an empty dictionary; num is greater than cur. If num is greater than cur + 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
