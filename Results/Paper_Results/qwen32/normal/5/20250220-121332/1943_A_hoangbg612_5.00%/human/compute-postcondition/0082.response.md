Output State: **`M` is a dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `cur` is the value of `num` (which is `num_next`), `num` is the next element in `N` (i.e., `num_next`).**

In simpler terms, the value of `cur` is updated to the value of `num`, which is the next element in the sorted list `N`. All other variables remain unchanged.
