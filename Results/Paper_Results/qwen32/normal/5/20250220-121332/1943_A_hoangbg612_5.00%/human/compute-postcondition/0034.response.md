To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior and how the variables `cur` and `M` evolve.

### Initial State Recap:
- `T` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `S` is an input integer.
- `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `cur` is initialized to -1.
- `M` is initialized to an empty dictionary.

### Loop Behavior:
The loop iterates over each number `num` in the sorted list `N`:
- If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop. Otherwise, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
- If `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, it increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1.

### Final Output State:
After the loop has iterated over all elements in `N`, `cur` will hold the highest value in `N` that was consecutively reachable starting from -1, and `M` will contain the count of each such reachable value.

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: `cur` starts at -1 and `M` is empty.
2. **Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates through each `num` in `N`.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur` but not more than `cur + 1`, `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1.
   - If `num` is equal to `cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.
   - If `num` is more than `cur + 1`, the loop breaks, and `cur` remains at the last valid value.
3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when either all elements in `N` are processed or when `num` is more than `cur + 1`.

### Final State:
- `cur` will be the highest number in `N` that is consecutively reachable starting from -1.
- `M` will contain the count of each such reachable value.

### Output State:
Output State: **`cur` is the highest number in `N` that is consecutively reachable starting from -1, and `M` contains the count of each such reachable value.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes, `cur` will be the largest number in the sorted list `N` that can be reached consecutively starting from -1, and `M` will have the counts of each of these reachable numbers.
