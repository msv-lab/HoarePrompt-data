The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range `cur`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to `cur`. If `i` is less than `cur`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is `x + 1` and `i` is also `x + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since `i` is the loop variable that gets incremented automatically in each iteration), and `cur` remains the same (`x + 1`).

However, we need to ensure that the loop condition `i < cur` holds true. Since `i` at the end of the last iteration is `x + 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 2` for the loop to execute again, but `cur` should still be `x + 1` which would make the loop condition `i < cur` false. This implies that the loop should not execute again if `i` is incremented to `x + 2` with `cur` being `x + 1`.

Given the context, it seems that the loop should not execute again if `i` is equal to `cur`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration, where the loop condition is checked, should have `i` incremented to `x + 2` (or more generally, the next value in the range), and `cur` remains `x + 1`.

State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` (or up to the last number before a gap) and values as the count of consecutive occurrences, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is `x + 1`, `i` is `x + 2`**
