The code snippet `cur = i` updates the value of `cur` to be equal to the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Given that `i` is `x + 1`, `cur` will now hold the value `x + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` (or up to the last number before a gap) and values as the count of consecutive occurrences, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is `x + 1`, `i` is `x + 1`**.
