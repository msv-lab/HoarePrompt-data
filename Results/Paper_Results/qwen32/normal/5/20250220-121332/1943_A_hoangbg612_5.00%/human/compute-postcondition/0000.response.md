Output State: **`T` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Natural Language: `T` is assigned the value of an input integer. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`) and their constraints remain unchanged as they have not been affected by the code snippet.
