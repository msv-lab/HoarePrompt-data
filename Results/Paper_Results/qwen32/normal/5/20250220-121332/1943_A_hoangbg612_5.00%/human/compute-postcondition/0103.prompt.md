Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their respective counts in `N`; `S` remains unchanged; `N` remains unchanged. If the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, then `cur` is the last element in `N` plus 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains the last element in `N`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cur):
    if M[i] <= i:
        cur = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their respective counts in `N`, `S` remains unchanged, `N` remains unchanged, and the last element in `N` is at least 1. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, then `cur` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the condition `M[i] > i` holds and no change is made to `cur`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their respective counts in `N`, `S` remains unchanged, `N` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, `cur` is set to the incremented value of `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 4 and `cur` is 4. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program does not alter `i` or `cur` and continues execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
