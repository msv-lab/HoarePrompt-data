The code assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. The value of `cur` is determined based on the condition `if num > cur + 1`, but since the value of `cur` is initially set to `num` and then potentially adjusted based on that condition, we need to consider both possibilities for `cur`.

1. If `num > cur + 1` was true, `cur` would be set to `0`.
2. If `num > cur + 1` was false, `cur` would remain `-1`.

Given these conditions, `cur` can either be `0` or `-1`. 

- If `cur` is `0`, then `M[0]` is set to `1`.
- If `cur` is `-1`, then `M[-1]` is set to `1`.

The values of `S`, `N`, and `num` are not affected by the code provided. 

Output State: **`M` is a dictionary with `cur` as the key and `1` as the value, where `cur` is either `0` or `-1`; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `num` is a value that determines `cur`.**
