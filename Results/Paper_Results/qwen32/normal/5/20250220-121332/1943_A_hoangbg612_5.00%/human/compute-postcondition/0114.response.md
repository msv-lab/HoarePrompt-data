The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, so `cur` changes from -1 to 0. The other variables (`N`, `M`, `S`, and `num`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is 0, and `num` is an integer greater than `cur` (which is 0).**
