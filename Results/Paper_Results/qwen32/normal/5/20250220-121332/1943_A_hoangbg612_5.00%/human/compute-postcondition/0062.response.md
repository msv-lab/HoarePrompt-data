Output State: **`M` is an empty dictionary; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `cur` is 0. The current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.**

In this output state, the variable `cur` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from -1 to 0. The other variables (`M`, `S`, `N`, and `num`) remain unchanged.
