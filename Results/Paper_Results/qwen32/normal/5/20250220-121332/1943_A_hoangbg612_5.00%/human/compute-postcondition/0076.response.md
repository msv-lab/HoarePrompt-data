The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. The values of `S`, `N`, `cur`, and `num` remain unchanged. Since `cur` is either -1 or 0, the value at that key in `M` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`M` is a dictionary where the value at key `cur` is incremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `cur` is either -1 or 0, and `num` is the next element in `N`.**
