Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is `num_next`, which is the next element in the list `N`; `cur` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been increased by 1, and the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
