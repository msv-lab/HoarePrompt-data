Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is either 0 or equal to the previous `num` + 1, `num` is the next integer in the list `N` after the previous `num` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of the variables `N`, `S`, `cur`, and `num` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
