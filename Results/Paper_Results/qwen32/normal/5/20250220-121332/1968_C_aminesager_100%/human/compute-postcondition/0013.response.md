To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the list `a` is being constructed. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`, and in each iteration, it appends a new element to the list `a` based on the previous element and the corresponding element in the list `T`.

Here's the step-by-step explanation of how `a` is built:

- Initially, `a` is `[1000]`.
- After the first iteration (`i = 1`), `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 + T[0]]`.
- After the second iteration (`i = 2`), `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 + T[0], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1]]`.
- After the third iteration (`i = 3`), `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 + T[0], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1] + T[2]]`.

Following this pattern, after `n-1` iterations, the list `a` will be:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = 1000 + T[0]`
- `a[2] = 1000 + T[0] + T[1]`
- `a[3] = 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2]`
- ...
- `a[n-1] = 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]`

So, the final list `a` will have `n` elements where the first element is `1000` and each subsequent element is the sum of `1000` and the cumulative sum of the elements in `T` up to the previous index.

The final output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer minus 1, `n` is an integer value provided by user input (2 <= n <= 500), `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the string `line`, `line` is the string input by the user, `a` is `[1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]]`**.

In simpler terms, `a` starts with `1000` and each subsequent element is `1000` plus the sum of the first `i-1` elements of `T`.
