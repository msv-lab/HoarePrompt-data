The code snippet provided takes the string `line` and splits it into a list of integers, which are then assigned to the variable `T`. The other variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged as per the code snippet. The list `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` is not directly affected by this code; however, it is implied that this list is equivalent to `T` after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer minus 1, `n` is the integer value provided by user input (2 <= n <= 500), `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the string `line`, `line` is the string input by the user.**
