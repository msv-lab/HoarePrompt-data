Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates a new list where each element is the cumulative sum starting from 1000, adding each integer from the input list sequentially. It then prints this new list as a space-separated string for each test case.**
