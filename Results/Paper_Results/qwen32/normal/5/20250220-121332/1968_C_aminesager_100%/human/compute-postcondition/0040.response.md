The code appends a new element to the list `a`. The new element is the sum of the last element of `a` and the second element of `T` (since `i` is 2, `i - 1` is 1).

Given:
- `a` initially contains `[1000, 1000 + T[0]]`.
- The new element to append is `a[1] + T[1]`, which is `(1000 + T[0]) + T[1]`.

Thus, the updated list `a` will be `[1000, 1000 + T[0], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1]]`.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 500), `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the new string `line`, `line` is the new string input by the user, `a` is [1000, 1000 + T[0], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1]], `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`, `i` is 2**.
