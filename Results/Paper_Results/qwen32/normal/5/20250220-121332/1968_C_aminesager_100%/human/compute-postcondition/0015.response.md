Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a non-zero integer minus 1. This value is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `n` is an integer value provided by user input, with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 500\).
- `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the string `line`. `line` is the string input by the user.
- `a` is a list defined as:
  \[
  a = [1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], \ldots, 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + \ldots + T[n-2]]
  \]
- `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **User Input (`n` and `line`)**:
   - The user inputs an integer `n` which specifies the number of integers in the string `line`.
   - The user also inputs a string `line` which contains `n` space-separated integers.

2. **Conversion of `line` to `T`**:
   - `T` is created by splitting the string `line` into a list of integers.

3. **Construction of List `a`**:
   - The list `a` is constructed iteratively:
     - The first element of `a` is `1000`.
     - Each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the next integer in the list `T`.

4. **Construction of `result`**:
   - `result` is created by joining the elements of `a` into a single string with spaces separating the elements.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example to illustrate the construction of `a` and `result`:
- Suppose the user inputs `n = 4` and `line = "10 20 30"`.
- `T` would be `[10, 20, 30]`.
- The list `a` would be constructed as follows:
  - \(a[0] = 1000\)
  - \(a[1] = 1000 + T[0] = 1000 + 10 = 1010\)
  - \(a[2] = 1010 + T[1] = 1010 + 20 = 1030\)
  - \(a[3] = 1030 + T[2] = 1030 + 30 = 1060\)
- Therefore, `a` would be `[1000, 1010, 1030, 1060]`.
- `result` would be the string `"1000 1010 1030 1060"`.

### General Output:
Given the above analysis, the `print(result)` statement will output a space-separated string of integers where the first integer is `1000` and each subsequent integer is the sum of the previous integer in `a` and the next integer in `T`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1000 [1000 + T[0]] [1000 + T[0] + T[1]] ... [1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]] (where T is the list of integers derived from splitting the user input string `line`)**
