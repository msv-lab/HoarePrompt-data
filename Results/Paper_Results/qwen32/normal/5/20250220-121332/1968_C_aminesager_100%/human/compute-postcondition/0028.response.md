Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer value provided by user input (2 <= n <= 500), T is a list of integers derived from splitting the string line, line is the new string input by the user, a is [1000, 1000 + T[0], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1], ..., (1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]) + T[n-1]], result is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of a**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `a` will contain `n` elements. The first element is `1000`. Each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`. Specifically, the `i`-th element of `a` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is the sum of `1000` and all elements of `T` from `T[0]` to `T[i-1]`. The variable `result` will be a string that contains all the elements of `a` separated by spaces. The variables `t`, `n`, `T`, and `line` remain unchanged from their initial states.
