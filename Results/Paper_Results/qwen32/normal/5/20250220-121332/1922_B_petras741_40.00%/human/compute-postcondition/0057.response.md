Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `w`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) for which `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`. Additionally, if `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `res` is the accumulated sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` is less than 3, no additional variables are defined or modified.**
