To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
2. `buffer` is an empty list.
3. `n` is a non-negative integer.
4. `w` is a list of integers with length `n`.
5. `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1.
6. `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in `w`.
7. `eta` is a list containing all the unique values from `w` that have a count greater than 0.
8. `j` is `n`.
9. `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`.
10. `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`.
11. `eta_ln` equals 1.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
```

This statement calculates the number of ways to choose 3 items from `n` items without regard to the order of selection, which is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} \).

### Determining the Output:
The value printed will be the result of the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the output depends on the specific value of `n`.

However, we don't have a specific value for `n` in the initial state, so we can't compute the exact numerical value. But we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

### Output:
Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (where n is a non-negative integer)**
