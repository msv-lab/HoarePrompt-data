Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); `buffer` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = {}
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
                if j > 1000:
                    break
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `w`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) for which `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`. Additionally, if `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `res` is the accumulated sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` is less than 3, no additional variables are defined or modified.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `n` is less than 3, `i` is incremented by 1, and other variables (`q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, `res`) are unchanged or not defined. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is incremented by 1 if `n` was less than 3, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with the element at index `w[j]` incremented by `n` for each occurrence of `w[j]` in `w`, `eta` is a list containing all `j` (0 ≤ j ≤ n) where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. If `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` and `res` is the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`. `j` is `n + 1` if `eta_ln` is 1, and `j` is `eta_ln - 1` if `eta_ln - 1` is less than or equal to 1000; otherwise, `j` is 1000.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, then `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in `w`, `eta` is a list of unique values from `w` that have a count greater than 0, `j` is updated to either `n` if `eta_ln` equals 1, or `eta_ln` otherwise, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]` if `eta_ln` equals 1, or the sum of all `q[eta[k]]` for `k` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` otherwise, and `res` is the sum of all contributions from each `eta[j]` for `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` if `eta_ln` does not equal 1. If `n` is less than 3, then no additional changes are made to `q`, `eta`, `j`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, or `res`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
