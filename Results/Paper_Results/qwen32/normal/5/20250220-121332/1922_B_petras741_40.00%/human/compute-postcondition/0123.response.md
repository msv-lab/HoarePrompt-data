The code snippet `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at the index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1. The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than `j + 2` and `j` is `j + 1`. This means that `j` has been incremented by 1 before the code snippet is executed. 

The output state will reflect that `j` has been incremented and the value at `q[w[j]]` has been increased by 1. The precondition `n > j + 2` is still valid after the execution of the code snippet, but `j` has a new value.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `j + 2`, `j` is incremented by 1, `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.**
