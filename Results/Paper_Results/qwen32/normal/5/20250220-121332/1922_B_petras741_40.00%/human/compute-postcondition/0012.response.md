The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n`, which means the loop has just finished executing for the last time.

To execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, the value of `j` at the start of the next iteration should be `j - 1` from the end of the previous iteration.

However, since `j` is `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop has already completed all iterations (from `0` to `n-1`). Therefore, to start another full loop, `j` should be reset to `0`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer with a value greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[n]]` which is 2, `j` is 0**
