Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer with a value greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `w`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) for which `q[j]` is greater than 0.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, `eta` will contain all the unique integers from the list `w` that have a count greater than 0, sorted in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, and `q`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
