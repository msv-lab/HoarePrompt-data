Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers with length `n`, `i` is the current value of i plus 1, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in `w`, `eta` is a list containing all the unique values from `w` that have a count greater than 0, and `j` is `n`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, `eta` will contain all the unique values from the list `w` that appear at least once. The variable `j` will be equal to `n`, which is the length of the list `w`. All other variables (`t`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, and `i`) will remain unchanged from their initial states as they are not modified within the loop.
