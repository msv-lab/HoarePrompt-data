The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `w`. The variables `t` and `buffer` are not affected by this code snippet. The variable `n` is also not directly affected, but it is mentioned in the initial state, so we should include it in the output state without modification.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
