### Reasoning:

Let's go through the problem description, the provided program, and the annotations to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to split a given string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s`. It then counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints the difference between these counts.

#### Annotations:
The annotations correctly describe the program's behavior:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
- It counts the number of '+' characters (`P`) and '-' characters (`M`).
- It prints the difference `P - M`.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not solve the problem as described. The program merely computes the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not related to the penalty calculation process. The correct approach involves splitting the string into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.

#### Counterexample:
The counterexample provided in the original assessment demonstrates the issue:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  3
  +--
  ```
- **Expected Output:** `2`
  - Optimal split: `([+], [--])` or `([+-], [-])` yields a total penalty of `1` or `1`, respectively.
- **Actual Output:** `0`
  - The program calculates `1 - 2 = -1` and prints `0` (absolute value of the difference).

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum penalty as required by the problem statement. The program's behavior, as described in the annotations, confirms that it performs an incorrect operation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
