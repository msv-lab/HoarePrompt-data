The code snippet `M += 1` increments the value of `M` by 1. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `M` is increased by 1, while `t`, `s`, `e`, `i`, and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is the new input integer, `e` is the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is `i + 1`, `q` is the next character in `e` after the current `q`. If `q` is '+', `P` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `M` is incremented by 1, and `M` is now `M + 1`.**
