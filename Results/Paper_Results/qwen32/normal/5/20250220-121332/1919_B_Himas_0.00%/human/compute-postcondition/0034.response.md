The code snippet provided is `M += 1`, which increments the value of `M` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `e`, `i`, `q`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is the new input integer, `e` is the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is `i + 1`, `q` is the next character in `e`, `M` is incremented by 1.**
