The value of `P` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `s`, `e`, `M`, and `q` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a string equal to the input value and has at least 2 characters. If `q` is equal to '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 1, `q` is the next character in the string `e`.
