You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of sticks, `a` is the list of stick lengths, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with each unique stick length as keys and their counts as values.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of sticks, `a` is the list of stick lengths, `ans` is the sum of `x // 3` for all `x` in `cnt`, `cnt` is a dictionary with each unique stick length as keys and their counts as values.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of x // 3 for all x in cnt, with x being the counts of unique stick lengths in the list a)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks (each between 1 and 100 inclusive). The function returns the result for each test case, which is not specified in the given output details.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
