The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks. This is followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. The total number of test cases, t, is provided at the beginning and satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
