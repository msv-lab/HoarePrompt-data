The code snippet initializes an empty dictionary `cnt`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For the first test case, `n` is an integer representing the number of sticks. The second line containing the lengths of the sticks for the first test case has been processed and stored in the list `a`. `ans` is 0. `cnt` is an empty dictionary.**
