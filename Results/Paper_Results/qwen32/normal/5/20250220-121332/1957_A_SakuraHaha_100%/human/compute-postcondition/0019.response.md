Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks (each between 1 and 100 inclusive). The function returns the result for each test case, which is not specified in the given output details.**
