#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of sticks, `a` is the list of stick lengths, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with each unique stick length as keys and their counts as values.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of sticks, `a` is the list of stick lengths, `ans` is the sum of `x // 3` for all `x` in `cnt`, `cnt` is a dictionary with each unique stick length as keys and their counts as values.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of x // 3 for all x in cnt, with x being the counts of unique stick lengths in the list a)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of sticks and their respective lengths. For each test case, it calculates how many groups of three sticks can be formed from each unique stick length and sums these values. The result for each test case is printed, representing the total number of groups of three sticks that can be formed.
