The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It also reads `q` queries, each consisting of a range `[l, r]`. For each query, the function determines whether a specific condition is met based on the count of 1s and the sum of elements in the specified range `[l, r]` of `nums`, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
