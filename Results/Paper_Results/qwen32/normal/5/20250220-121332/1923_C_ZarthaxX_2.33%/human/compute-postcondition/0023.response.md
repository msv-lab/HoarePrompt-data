Given the initial state and the provided conditions, let's analyze the print statement `print('YES')`:

The initial state describes several variables and lists (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `l`, `r`, `onesInRange`, `sumInRange`) and their relationships. However, the specific values of these variables are not provided, and the print statement itself does not depend on the values of any of these variables directly. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

The condition `(2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange)` is mentioned to hold true, but it does not affect the output of the print statement since the print statement does not evaluate this condition or use its result. It merely prints `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is straightforward.

Output: **YES**
