The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. This statement is independent of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `q-1`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `l`, `r`, `onesInRange`, and `sumInRange` as described in the initial state. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'NO'` regardless of the values of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **NO**
