Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we need to determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement.

Here is the breakdown of the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` and `q-1` are integers where 1 <= n, q-1 <= 3 * 10^5.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9).
- `nums` is a list of integers.
- `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1` for all i from 1 to n.
- `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, with each element decremented by 1.
- `l` and `r` are integers read from the input.
- `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
- `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables or the state of the program. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
