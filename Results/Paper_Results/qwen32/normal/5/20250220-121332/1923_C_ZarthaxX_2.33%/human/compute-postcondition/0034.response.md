To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, we need to analyze the conditions given in the initial state and the logic that leads to the print statement.

The initial state provides us with several variables and their properties:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` and `q` are integers where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9).
- `nums` is a list of integers.
- `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1` for all i from 1 to n.
- `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, with each element decremented by 1.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `l` and `r` are integers read from the input.
- `onesInRange` is defined as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
- `sumInRange` is defined as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.

The conditions given are:
- If `l` equals `r`, the condition (2 * `onesInRange` + (`r` - `l` + 1) - `onesInRange` <= `sumInRange`) holds true.
- Otherwise, if `l` does not equal `r`, the condition (2 * `onesInRange` + (`r` - `l` + 1) - `onesInRange` > `sumInRange`) holds true.

The print statement `print('YES')` is executed based on the truth of these conditions. However, the exact values of `l`, `r`, `onesInRange`, and `sumInRange` are not provided, so we cannot determine a specific numerical result. But based on the problem setup, we know that the print statement `print('YES')` will execute if the conditions are met.

Given that the print statement `print('YES')` is directly executed without any conditional branching that would prevent it from running, we can conclude that the conditions are satisfied, and the output will be 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
