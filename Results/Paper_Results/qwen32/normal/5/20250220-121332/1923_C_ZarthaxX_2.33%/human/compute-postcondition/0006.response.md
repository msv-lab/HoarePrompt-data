The code snippet updates the `sum` list by setting `sum[i]` to the value of `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for a specific index `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `ones` remain unchanged. The `sum` list will have its `i`-th element updated based on the given formula.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `nums` is a list of integers read from input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for the specific `i` being updated.**
