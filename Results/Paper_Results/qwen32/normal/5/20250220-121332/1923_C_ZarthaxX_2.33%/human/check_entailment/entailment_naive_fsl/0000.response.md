Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is good based on the given problem description. Let's analyze the logic and identify a potential issue.

The program uses two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the number of ones and the adjusted sum of the subarray elements, respectively. Here is a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of ones up to index `i-1`.
   - `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of the elements up to index `i-1` minus the count of ones up to index `i-1`.

2. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the number of ones and the adjusted sum in the subarray `c[l:r+1]`.
   - It then checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` holds to determine if the subarray is good.

However, there is a fundamental flaw in the logic used to determine if a subarray is good. The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is not correctly reflecting the requirement that there must exist an array `b` such that:
- The sum of `a` and `b` are equal.
- Each element in `a` is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
- Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

Let's consider a specific test case to illustrate the issue:

**Test Case**:
```
1
3 1
2 2 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output**:
```
YES
```

**Explanation**:
- The subarray `c[1:3]` is `[2, 2, 2]`.
- We can construct `b` as `[1, 1, 1]` which satisfies all the conditions:
  - Sum of `a` and `b` are equal: `2 + 2 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 6`.
  - Each element in `a` is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
  - Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

However, the provided program will output `NO` for this test case because the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` does not hold true for this specific case.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
