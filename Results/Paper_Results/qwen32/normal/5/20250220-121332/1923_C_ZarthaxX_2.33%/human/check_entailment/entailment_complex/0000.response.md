### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine if a given subarray of an array `c` is "good" based on the conditions specified in the problem statement. Here's a detailed analysis of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, both of size `n + 1` (where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`).
   - `ones[i]` is intended to store the count of `1`s in the subarray `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]`.
   - `sum[i]` is intended to store the cumulative sum of the subarray `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]` with each element decremented by `1`.

2. **Computing `ones` and `sum` Arrays**:
   - The program iterates over the array `nums` and updates the `ones` and `sum` arrays accordingly.
   - `ones[i]` is updated to include the count of `1`s up to the current index.
   - `sum[i]` is updated to include the cumulative sum of elements up to the current index, with each element decremented by `1`.

3. **Handling Queries**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the number of `1`s (`onesInRange`) and the adjusted sum (`sumInRange`) within the specified range `[l, r]`.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is checked to determine if the subarray is "good".
   - The condition essentially checks if it is possible to construct an array `b` such that:
     - The sum of `b` equals the sum of the subarray.
     - No element in `b` equals the corresponding element in the subarray.
     - All elements in `b` are positive.

4. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` simplifies to `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`.
   - This condition ensures that there is enough "slack" in the sum to adjust the elements of the subarray to form a valid `b` array.
   - Specifically, it checks if the number of `1`s plus the number of elements in the subarray is less than or equal to the sum of the subarray minus the number of `1`s (since each `1` can only be adjusted to a value greater than `1`).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `l == r` by printing "NO" because a single-element subarray cannot satisfy the condition of having all elements different from `b`.
   - The program processes up to `3 * 10^5` elements and queries efficiently, adhering to the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the provided conditions. The condition used to check the feasibility of constructing the array `b` is sound and efficiently handles the input constraints.

**Correctness: True**
