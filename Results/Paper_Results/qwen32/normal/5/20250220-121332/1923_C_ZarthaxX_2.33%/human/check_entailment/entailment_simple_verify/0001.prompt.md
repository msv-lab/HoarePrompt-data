You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
A subarray is considered "good" if there exists an integer array `b` of the same length as the subarray such that:
1. The sum of elements in the subarray is equal to the sum of elements in `b`.
2. Each element in the subarray is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
3. Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an array `nums` and performs `q` queries. For each query, it determines if the subarray `nums[l-1:r]` is "good".

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Prefix Arrays Construction**:
   - `ones[i]`: Stores the count of `1`s in the subarray `nums[0:i]`.
   - `sum[i]`: Stores the sum of the subarray `nums[0:i]` minus the number of elements in that subarray. This is equivalent to the sum of the subarray minus its length.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it calculates the number of `1`s and the adjusted sum in the subarray `nums[l-1:r]` using the prefix arrays.
   - It then checks if the subarray can be transformed into a "good" array `b`:
     - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is used to determine if a valid `b` can be constructed.

#### Condition Analysis:
The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is derived as follows:
- `onesInRange`: Number of `1`s in the subarray.
- `sumInRange`: Sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray.
- To make the subarray "good", we need to ensure that each element in `b` is greater than 0 and different from the corresponding element in the subarray.
- If the subarray contains `onesInRange` number of `1`s, we need to increase each `1` to at least `2` (to satisfy `b_i > 0` and `a_i != b_i`). This contributes `onesInRange` to the sum.
- For the remaining elements, we need to ensure they are different from the original elements, but since they are already greater than 1, we just need to ensure the overall sum condition is satisfied.
- The term `(r - l + 1) - onesInRange` accounts for the remaining elements that need to be adjusted.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the problem description. The condition used in the program accurately checks if a valid `b` can be constructed for each subarray.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
