Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list `c`, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The list `c` consists of `n` integers, each greater than 0. For each query, it receives two integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing a range within the list `c`. The function processes these inputs and returns the sum of the elements in the list `c` for each query range `[l_i, r_i]`.**
