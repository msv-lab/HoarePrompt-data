The provided code snippet reads two integers `l` and `r` from the input and splits them into separate variables. This operation does not affect any of the existing variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, or `sum`. It only introduces two new variables `l` and `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `nums` is a list of integers read from input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1` for all i from 1 to n; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, with each element decremented by 1; `q` must be greater than 0; `l` and `r` are integers read from input.**
