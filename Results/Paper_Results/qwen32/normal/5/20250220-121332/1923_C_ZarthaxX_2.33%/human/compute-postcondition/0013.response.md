Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `nums` is a list of integers read from input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1` for all i from 1 to n; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, with each element decremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all iterations, `ones[i]` will contain the number of 1s in the `nums` list up to the `i-1` index, and `sum[i]` will contain the sum of the elements in `nums` up to the `i-1` index, with each element in the sum being decremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
