The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `l` and `r`. The previous values of `l` and `r` are overwritten by the new input values. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q-1` are integers where 1 <= n, q-1 <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `nums` is a list of integers; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1` for all i from 1 to n; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, with each element decremented by 1; `l` and `r` are integers read from the input; `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`; `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.**
