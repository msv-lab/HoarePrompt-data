Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a non-empty string, `slength` is an input integer, `i` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus 1, `counter` is `counter + 1`, `x` is the next character in `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged except for the update to `i` and `counter`.**
