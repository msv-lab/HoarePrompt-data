`slength` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables `t`, `tests`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `slength` is an input integer**.
