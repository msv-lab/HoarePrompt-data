The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the length of strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, with the constraint that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each consist of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n` and strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a result for each test case based on these inputs.**
