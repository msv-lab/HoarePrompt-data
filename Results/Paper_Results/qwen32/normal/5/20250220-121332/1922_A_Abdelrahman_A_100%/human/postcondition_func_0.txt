The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it checks if a given string `c` can be formed by characters from corresponding positions in strings `a` and `b`. It prints 'YES' if for every character in `c`, there is a corresponding character in either `a` or `b` at the same position, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
