Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**

Explanation: The value of `tests` is assigned the integer value from the input. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
