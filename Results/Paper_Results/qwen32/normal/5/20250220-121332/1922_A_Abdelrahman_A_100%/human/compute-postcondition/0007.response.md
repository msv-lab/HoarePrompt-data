Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `slength` is an input integer, and `no` is True. Additionally, `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`.**
