Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `slength` is an input integer, `no` is True, `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, `counter` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
        no = False
        print('YES')
        break
    counter += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `slength` is an input integer, `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, and `counter` is 1. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is False and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `no` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `slength` is an input integer, `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, and `counter` is 3. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `no` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `slength` is an input integer, `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, and `counter` is 4. `x` is `c[4]`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is set to False, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues as per the original flow.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
