Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `s` is 0; `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop iterations; `i` is equal to `m` after the loop completes.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable `a` will hold the sum of all `f` values that were read from the input during each iteration of the loop. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state, except that the loop counter `i` will have reached the value of `m`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
