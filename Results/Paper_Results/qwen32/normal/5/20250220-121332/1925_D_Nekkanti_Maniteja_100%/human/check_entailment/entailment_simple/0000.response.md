### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions, and then express this value as a fraction \(\dfrac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers. The final result should be calculated as \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

Let's break down the provided code and see if it correctly implements the logic to achieve this:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
   - It then reads \(m\) lines, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
   - The code calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\dfrac{1}{n(n-1)/2}\) modulo \(10^9+7\). This is correct as it represents the probability of selecting any given pair among all possible pairs.

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The code correctly sums up the initial friendship values of all the pairs.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The code attempts to calculate the expected value, but there seems to be an issue in the formula used.
   - The expected value calculation in the code is:
     ```python
     for i in range(k):
         s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
     ```
   - This loop seems to be incorrectly calculating the expected sum of friendship values over \(k\) excursions.

### Issues in the Code:
- The formula used inside the loop does not correctly represent the expected sum of friendship values.
- The expected value should consider the probability of choosing a pair and the expected increase in the friendship value due to previous excursions.

### Correct Formula:
The correct formula for the expected value can be derived as follows:
- The probability of choosing any pair in one excursion is \(\dfrac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \dfrac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
- The expected value of the sum of friendship values over \(k\) excursions can be calculated using the linearity of expectation.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values over \(k\) excursions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
