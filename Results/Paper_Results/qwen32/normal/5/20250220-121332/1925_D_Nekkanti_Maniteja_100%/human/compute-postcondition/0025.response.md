The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `M` is a constant 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is a specific expression involving `c`, `m`, `k`, and `a`, and `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop iterations. The variable `i` is initially set to `k + 1`.

The code snippet only updates `n`, `m`, and `k` by reading new values from the input. Therefore, the values of `t`, `M`, `c`, `s`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop iterations, `i` is `k + 1`.**
