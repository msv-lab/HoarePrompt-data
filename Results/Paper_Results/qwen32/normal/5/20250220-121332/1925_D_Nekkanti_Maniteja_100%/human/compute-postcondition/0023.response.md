To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the variables and their values based on the initial state provided.

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\).
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, with `k` being greater than 0.
   - `M` is a constant integer \(1000000007\).
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo `M`.
   - `s` is calculated as \(c^2 \times m \times (k-1) \times k // 2 + c \times a \times k\).
   - `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop iterations.
   - `i` is equal to `k`.

2. **Expression for `s`:**
   - The expression for `s` is given as \(c^2 \times m \times (k-1) \times k // 2 + c \times a \times k\).
   - This expression involves the modular multiplicative inverse `c`, the integers `m` and `k`, and the sum `a`.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The final value to be printed is `s % M`, which is the value of `s` taken modulo `M`.

4. **Output Description:**
   - The output will be the result of the expression \(s \% M\).
   - Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the `f` values are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s`.
   - However, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables and the expression for `s`.

Given the above analysis, the output will be the result of the expression \(s \% M\), where `s` is calculated as described.

Output: **s % M (where s is calculated as c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, a is the sum of all f values read from the input during the loop iterations, and M is 1000000007)**
