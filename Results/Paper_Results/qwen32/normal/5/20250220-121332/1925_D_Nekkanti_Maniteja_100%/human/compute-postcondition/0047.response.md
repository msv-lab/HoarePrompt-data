To determine the output of the `print(s % M)` statement, we need to understand the values and calculations leading up to `s`.

1. **Variables and Constants**:
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 (not directly used in the calculation of `s`).
   - `n`, `m`, `k`: Integers read from the input, with `k > 0`.
   - `M`: A constant integer, 1000000007.
   - `c`: The modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`.
   - `a`: The sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations.
   - `s`: Calculated as `c * ((c * m * k * (k-1) // 2) % M + k * a % M) % M`.
   - `i`: Calculated as `k + m` (not directly used in the calculation of `s`).

2. **Calculation of `s`**:
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`. This means `c` is a number such that `(c * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) % M == 1`.
   - `a` is the sum of `m` integers `f` read from the input.
   - `s` is calculated in two main parts:
     - The first part is `c * m * k * (k-1) // 2 % M`.
     - The second part is `k * a % M`.
     - These two parts are added together and then multiplied by `c` again, and the result is taken modulo `M`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The final output is `s % M`, which simplifies to `s` since `s` is already calculated modulo `M`.

Given the above calculations, the output of the `print(s % M)` statement will be the value of `s` as calculated by the given formula.

Output: **s (where s is calculated as c * ((c * m * k * (k-1) // 2) % M + k * a % M) % M)**
