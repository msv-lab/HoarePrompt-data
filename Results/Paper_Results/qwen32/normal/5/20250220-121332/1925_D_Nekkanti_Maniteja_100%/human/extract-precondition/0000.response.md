Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5. For each of the m lines in a test case, a_i and b_i are integers such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and f_i is an integer such that 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. All pairs (a_i, b_i) are distinct within a test case.**
