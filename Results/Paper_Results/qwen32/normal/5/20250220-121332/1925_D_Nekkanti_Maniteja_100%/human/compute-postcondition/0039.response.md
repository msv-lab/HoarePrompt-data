To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to analyze the changes made to the variables within the loop and how they evolve over time.

### Analysis:
- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4.
  - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0.
  - `M` is 1000000007.
  - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`.
  - `s` is 0.
  - `a` is 0.
  - `i` is `k + 1`.

- **Loop Structure:**
  - The loop runs `m` times.
  - In each iteration, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input.
  - The variable `a` is incremented by `f`.

### Observations from the Output States:
- After 1 iteration, `a` is `f`.
- After 2 iterations, `a` is `2 * f`.
- After 3 iterations, `a` is `3 * f`.

From this pattern, it is clear that after `m` iterations, `a` will be the sum of all `f` values read in each iteration.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- `M` remains 1000000007.
- `c` remains the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`.
- `s` remains 0.
- `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations.
- `i` is `k + m` after the loop completes.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations, `i` is `k + m`.**

### Natural Language Description:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `a` will hold the sum of all `f` values read from the input during each iteration. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, and `s` remain unchanged. The variable `i` will be `k + m`, reflecting the total number of iterations completed.
