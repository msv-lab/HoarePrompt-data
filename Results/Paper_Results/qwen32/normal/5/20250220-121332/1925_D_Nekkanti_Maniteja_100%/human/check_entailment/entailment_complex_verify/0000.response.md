### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's systematically analyze the program using the annotations and the problem description.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Total Pairs Calculation**: The total number of possible pairs among `n` children is `C = n * (n - 1) / 2`.
2. **Probability of Choosing a Pair**: The probability of choosing any specific pair in one excursion is `1 / C`.
3. **Friendship Value Update**: If a pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
4. **Expected Value Calculation**: For each pair of friends `(a_i, b_i)` with an initial friendship value `f_i`, the expected value of their contribution to the total sum over `k` excursions is:
   - The sum of an arithmetic series: `f_i * (1 + 2 + ... + k) / C + (1 + 2 + ... + (k-1)) / C + ... + 1 / C`.
   - This simplifies to `f_i * (k * (k + 1) / 2) / C` for the initial value plus the incremental increases.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   M = 10 ** 9 + 7
   c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
   s = 0
   a = 0
   ```
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, which is correct for calculating the probability of choosing any specific pair.
   - `a` is initialized to 0 and will store the sum of all initial friendship values.

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values**:
   ```python
   for i in range(m):
       u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
       a += f
   ```
   - This correctly sums up the initial friendship values of all friend pairs.

3. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**:
   ```python
   for i in range(k):
       s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
   ```
   - This loop attempts to calculate the sum of friendship values, but the formula used is incorrect.
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation. It incorrectly assumes a linear relationship and does not account for the incremental increase in friendship values correctly.

#### Correct Approach:
- For each pair of friends `(a_i, b_i)` with initial friendship value `f_i`, the expected value of their contribution to the total sum over `k` excursions is:
  - `f_i * (k * (k + 1) / 2) / C` for the initial value plus the incremental increases.
- The total expected value is the sum of the expected values for all pairs.
- The final result is the sum of these expected values, modulo `M`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The formula used in the loop is incorrect, and the program does not account for the incremental increases in friendship values properly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
