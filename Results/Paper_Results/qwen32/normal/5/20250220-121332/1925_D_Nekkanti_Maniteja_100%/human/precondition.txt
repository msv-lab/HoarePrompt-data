There are t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4). For each test case, n is the number of children (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), m is the number of pairs of friends (0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2)), and k is the number of excursions (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5). Each of the m lines contains three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i, where a_i and b_i are the indices of the pair of friends (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i), and f_i is their initial friendship value (1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9). All pairs of friends are distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
