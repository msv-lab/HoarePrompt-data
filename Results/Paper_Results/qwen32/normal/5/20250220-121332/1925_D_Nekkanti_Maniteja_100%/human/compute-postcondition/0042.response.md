The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value that is less than `k` (since the loop just completed an iteration), and `k` is a constant that does not change.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, and `s` do not change and are not part of the loop head, so they remain the same.

Therefore, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c`, `i` is `i + 1`**
