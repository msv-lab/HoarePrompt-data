The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range is `k`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `k` must be at least 1. The state of `i` before the loop starts is irrelevant because it is set to 0 before the loop begins and is then assigned values from the range `k`.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

- `k` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes at least once.
- `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is assigned values from the range `k` during the loop execution.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop iterations, `i` is the loop variable that will be assigned values from the range `k`**
