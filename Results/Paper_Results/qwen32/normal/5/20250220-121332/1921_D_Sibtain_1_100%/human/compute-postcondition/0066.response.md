Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `c` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is `len(a)`, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `i` is 1, `j` is either 1 or 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
