The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the `j`-th element from the end of list `a` and the `j`-th element from the end of list `c`, and assigns this value to `t2`.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, and `t1` remain unchanged except for the introduction of `t2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the input in descending order, `ans` is the previous `ans` plus `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is `k + 1`, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`.**

In simple terms: All variables retain their previous values except for `t2`, which is now the absolute difference between the `j`-th element from the end of `a` and the `j`-th element from the end of `c`.
