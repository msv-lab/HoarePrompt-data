Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order; `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for all iterations, where `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])` and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`; `k` is `len(a) - 1`; `i` and `j` are determined based on the comparison of `t1` and `t2` throughout the loop. The loop will execute one more time if the number of remaining iterations is greater than 0. If `len(a) == 1`, the specific behavior inside the if block is as described in the if part. Otherwise, the variables remain unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, taking into account the condition `len(a) == 1` and the behavior specified in the if part. If the condition is not met, the variables retain their original values as described in the precondition.
