The `continue` statement in Python does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, or `j` will be altered by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a new sorted list of integers read from the input, `c` is a new list of integers read from the input, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for all iterations, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` and `j` are updated based on the comparisons in each iteration.**
