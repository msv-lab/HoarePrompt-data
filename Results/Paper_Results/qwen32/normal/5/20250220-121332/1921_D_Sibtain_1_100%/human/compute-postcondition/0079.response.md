The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state mentioned other variables (`t`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, `j`), but the provided code snippet does not affect these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `c` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for all iterations, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` and `j` are updated based on the comparisons in each iteration. The values of `n` and `m` are now set to the integers read from the input.**
