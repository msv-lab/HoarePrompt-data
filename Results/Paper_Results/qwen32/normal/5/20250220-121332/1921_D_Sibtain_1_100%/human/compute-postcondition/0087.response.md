To determine what will be printed by the given statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the print statement.

### Analysis:

1. **Variables and Lists**:
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `n` and `m`: Integers read from the input.
   - `a`: A sorted list of integers read from the input.
   - `c`: A sorted list of integers read from the input in descending order.
   - `ans`: The sum of `max(t1, t2)` for all iterations (not directly relevant to the print statement).
   - `k`: The index `len(a) - 1`.
   - `i` and `j`: Indices updated based on comparisons in each iteration (not directly relevant to the print statement).

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement computes the maximum of two absolute differences:
     - `abs(a[0] - max(c))`
     - `abs(a[0] - min(c))`

3. **Understanding the Values**:
   - `a[0]`: The smallest element in the sorted list `a` (since `a` is sorted in ascending order).
   - `max(c)`: The largest element in the sorted list `c` (since `c` is sorted in descending order, `max(c)` is the first element of `c`).
   - `min(c)`: The smallest element in the sorted list `c` (since `c` is sorted in descending order, `min(c)` is the last element of `c`).

4. **Computation**:
   - `abs(a[0] - max(c))`: The absolute difference between the smallest element in `a` and the largest element in `c`.
   - `abs(a[0] - min(c))`: The absolute difference between the smallest element in `a` and the smallest element in `c`.

5. **Result**:
   - The output will be the maximum of these two absolute differences.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the maximum of the absolute differences between the smallest element in `a` and the largest element in `c`, and the smallest element in `a` and the smallest element in `c`.

Output: **max(abs(a[0] - c[0]), abs(a[0] - c[-1])) (where a[0] is the smallest element in the list a, c[0] is the largest element in the list c, and c[-1] is the smallest element in the list c)**
