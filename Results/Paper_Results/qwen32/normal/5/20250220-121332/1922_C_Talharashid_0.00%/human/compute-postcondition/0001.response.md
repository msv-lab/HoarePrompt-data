The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable for iterating over the range `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, `y_i`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0**
