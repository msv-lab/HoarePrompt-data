Let's analyze the provided Python code snippet and update the variables based on the initial state.

The initial state provides us with several variables and their properties:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is 0
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d2[start]` is `s`
- `n` is an input integer
- `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element
- `start` is `len(lst) - 3`
- `end` is 0
- `inc` is -1
- `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` remains the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111

The code snippet is:
```
s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
```

We need to calculate the new value of `s` after this operation. The variable `s` is initially `d2[start]`. 

The expression `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` calculates the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start + inc`. Given that `inc` is -1, this is the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`.

Therefore, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`.

The output state will be:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` remains 0
- `d1` remains a defaultdict with default int values
- `d2` remains a defaultdict with default int values, but `d2[start]` is now `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`
- `n` remains the input integer
- `lst` remains a list of integers with more than one element
- `start` remains `len(lst) - 3`
- `end` remains 0
- `inc` remains -1
- `mini` remains the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` remains the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d2[start]` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element, `start` is `len(lst) - 3`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` remains the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111.**
