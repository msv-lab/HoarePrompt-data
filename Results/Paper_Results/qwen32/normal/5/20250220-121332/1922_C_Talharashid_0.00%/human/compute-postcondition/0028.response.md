Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `start` is `end - 1`, and `mini` is updated to `min(11111111, abs(lst[len(lst) - 2] - lst[len(lst) - 1]))` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`. `s` remains as it was calculated before the increment. If `start + 1` is not less than the length of `lst`, `mini` retains its initial value of 11111111.**
