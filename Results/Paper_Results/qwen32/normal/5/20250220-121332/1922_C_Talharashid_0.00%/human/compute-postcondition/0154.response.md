Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is either 0 or `abs(lst[m] - lst[m + 1])`, `start` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`. If `start + 1 < len(lst)`, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.**
