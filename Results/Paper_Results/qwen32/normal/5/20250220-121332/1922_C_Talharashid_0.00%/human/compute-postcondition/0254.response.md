The given code snippet is:
```
d1 = defaultdict(int)
```

This line of code reassigns `d1` to be a new `defaultdict` with default integer values. This means that any key that does not exist in `d1` will now have a default value of `0` when accessed.

The variables `t`, `i`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `start`, `end`, `inc`, `m`, `s`, and `mini` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2*m + 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and d2[start] = s for each start from len(lst) - 1 to 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` and `end` are the values read in the last iteration and have been decremented, `inc` is -1, `m` is the input integer, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration.**
