The code snippet assigns the value `len(lst) - 1` to the variable `end`. This means `end` now holds the index of the last element in the list `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`.**
