The code snippet `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Since `s` is the value of `d2[start]` initially, after the increment, `d2[start]` will hold the new value of `s + 1`.

No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d2[start]` is `s + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element, `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the smaller of 11111111, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.**
