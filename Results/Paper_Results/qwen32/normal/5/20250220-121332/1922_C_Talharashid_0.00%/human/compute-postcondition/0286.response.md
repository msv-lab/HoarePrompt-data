Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2*m + 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a new defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `end` is len(lst) - 1 (which is at least 1), `inc` is 1, `m` is the input integer, `start` is `start + inc`, and `mini` is the minimum of 11111111, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, and if `start - 1 > -1`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. If `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `d1[start]` is `s + 1` and `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `d1[start]` is `s` and `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`.**

In simple terms, the variable `start` has been incremented by `inc` (which is 1). All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
