The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**
