You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

For each query, it calculates and prints the minimum distance required to travel from one city to another, considering the closest city uniquely determined for each.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and see if it correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Let's break it down step by step:

### Problem Understanding:
- We have `n` cities located on a number line with unique coordinates.
- For each city, there is a uniquely defined closest city.
- We need to find the minimum cost to travel from one city to another using two types of moves:
  1. Move to the closest city for 1 coin.
  2. Move to any other city for the direct distance in coins.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, their coordinates, the number of queries `m`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Closest City Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the cost to reach each city from the start and end using the closest city rule.
   - It initializes two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` to store the cumulative cost to reach each city from the start and end, respectively.
   - The program iterates over the cities, calculating the cost to reach each city using the closest city rule and stores these costs in `d1` and `d2`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it calculates the cost to travel from the start city to the end city using the precomputed costs in `d1` and `d2`.
   - It computes two possible costs: one by using `d1` and the other by using `d2`, and then prints the minimum of these two costs.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Closest City Costs**:
  - The logic for calculating the cost to reach each city from the start and end using the closest city rule is flawed.
  - The program does not correctly identify the closest city for each city and instead seems to be adding up the distances in a way that does not reflect the closest city rule.
  - The variable `inc` is used incorrectly, and the logic for updating the cost `s` is not aligned with the problem requirements.

- **Incorrect Cost Calculation for Queries**:
  - The program attempts to calculate the cost for each query by using the precomputed costs in `d1` and `d2`.
  - However, these costs are not correctly calculated, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the program, it is clear that the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic for calculating the closest city costs and the costs for each query is flawed.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
