The code snippet provided is:
```
s += 1
```
This line increments the variable `s` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 0 to `end - 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d2[0] = s`, `d2[-1] = s`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least one element, `start` is -1, `end` is 1, `inc` is -1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is incremented by 1. If `start - 1 > -1`, then `mini` is updated to `min(mini, abs(lst[-1] - lst[-2]))`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.**
