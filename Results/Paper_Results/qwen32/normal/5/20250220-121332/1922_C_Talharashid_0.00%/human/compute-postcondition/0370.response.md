The code snippet provided is `end -= 1`, which decrements the value of `end` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation. Given the initial state, `end` is the second integer from the new input minus 1. After the operation, `end` will be the second integer from the new input minus 2.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is 2, `d1` will have keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration, `d2` will have keys from `len(lst) - 1` to `1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration, `n` remains the same, `lst` remains the same, `end` is the second integer from the new input minus 2, `inc` is -1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is the first integer from the new input minus 2, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `s` is 0. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. If `start` is not less than `end`, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**
