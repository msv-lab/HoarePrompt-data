The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `lst`. The values of `t`, `i`, `d1`, and `d2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
