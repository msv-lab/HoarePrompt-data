Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 0 to `end - 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d2[0] = s`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least one element, `start` is 0, `end` is 1, `inc` is -1, `m` is the total number of iterations. If `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[0] - lst[-1])`. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to `min(abs(lst[0] - lst[-1]), mini)`, and `s` is set to 1 if `mini` equals `abs(lst[0] - lst[-1])`, otherwise `s` is set to `abs(lst[1] - lst[0])`. If `start - 1` is not greater than -1, no changes are made to `mini` or `s`.**
