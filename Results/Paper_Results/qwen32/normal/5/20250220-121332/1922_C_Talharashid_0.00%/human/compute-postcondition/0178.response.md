To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state so that the condition `start != end` is true. According to the provided state, `start` is `end` (i.e., `len(lst) - 1`), and `end` is 0. Therefore, initially, `start` is equal to `end`, and the loop condition is false.

To make the loop condition true, we need to adjust either `start` or `end` so that they are not equal. Since `end` is set to 0, we can adjust `start` to be any value other than 0. Given that `start` is initially `len(lst) - 1`, we can ensure that `start` is not equal to `end` by making sure `lst` has at least one element, which would make `start` equal to 0 - 1 = -1 (if we adjust it directly), but a more logical adjustment would be to set `start` to 1 if `end` is 0, assuming `lst` has at least one element.

However, since `start` is `len(lst) - 1`, if `lst` has at least one element, `start` should be at least 0. To ensure the loop condition is true, we can set `start` to 1 if `end` is 0, which is a valid adjustment given the constraints.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 0 to `end - 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least one element, `start` is 1, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration**
