To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(s1, s2))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the definitions of the variables involved.

### Given Initial State:
- `t` remains the same (not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 1 (not used in the print statement).
- `d1` has keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration.
- `d2` has keys from `len(lst) - 1` to 1 with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration.
- `n` remains the same (not used in the print statement).
- `lst` remains the same (not used in the print statement directly, but influences `d1` and `d2`).
- `end` is the second integer from the input minus 1.
- `inc` is -1 (not used in the print statement).
- `m` must be greater than 0 (not used in the print statement).
- `start` is the first integer from the input minus 1.
- `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration (not used in the print statement directly).
- `s` is 0 (initial value, but not used in the print statement directly).

### Calculation of `s1` and `s2`:
The values of `s1` and `s2` depend on the relationship between `start` and `end`:
- If `start` is less than `end`:
  - `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`
  - `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`
- If `start` is not less than `end`:
  - `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`
  - `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`

### Output:
The `print(min(s1, s2))` statement will print the minimum value between `s1` and `s2`.

### Explanation:
The exact numerical values of `s1` and `s2` depend on the values in `d1` and `d2`, which are not explicitly given. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output as the minimum of the two calculated differences.

Output: **min(s1, s2) (where s1 is abs(d1[end] - d1[start]) if start < end, otherwise abs(d2[end] - d2[start]), and s2 is abs(d2[start] - d2[end]) if start < end, otherwise abs(d1[start] - d1[end]))**
