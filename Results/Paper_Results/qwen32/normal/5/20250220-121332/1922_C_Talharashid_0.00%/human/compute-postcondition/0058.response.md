The code snippet updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is 0
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values
- `n` is an input integer
- `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element
- `start` is `len(lst) - 1` and `start - 1 > -1`
- `end` is 0
- `inc` is -1
- `s` is 0
- `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.

After executing the code `mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)`, the value of `mini` is recalculated to reflect the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element, `start` is `len(lst) - 1` and `start - 1 > -1`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of the previous `mini` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`.**
