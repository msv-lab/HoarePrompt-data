Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s` is set to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. In both cases, `mini` remains the minimum of 11111111, `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start` is greater than 0.**
