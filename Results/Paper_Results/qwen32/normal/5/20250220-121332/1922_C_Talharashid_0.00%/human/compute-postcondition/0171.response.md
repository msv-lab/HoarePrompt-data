The code snippet provided increments the `start` variable by the value of `inc`, which is 1. This means `start` will now be `start + 1`.

Here are the changes:
- `start` is now `start + 1`.

All other variables (`t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `end`, `inc`, `m`, `mini`, and `s`) remain unchanged based on the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start - 1] = s` (updated), `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `start` is now `start + 1` and must be less than `end - 1`. If `start - 2 > -1`, `mini` is the minimum of `mini` and `abs(lst[start - 1] - lst[start - 2])`. If `mini == abs(lst[start - 1] - lst[start + inc])`, `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start - 1] - lst[start + inc])`. If `start - 2` is not greater than -1, `mini` remains unchanged and `s` is updated based on the condition as described.**
