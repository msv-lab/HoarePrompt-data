Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is the new value read from the input minus 1, `end` is the new value read from the input minus 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`. If `start` is less than `end`, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**

Explanation: The value of `s1` has been updated to `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`. All other variables retain their initial values.
