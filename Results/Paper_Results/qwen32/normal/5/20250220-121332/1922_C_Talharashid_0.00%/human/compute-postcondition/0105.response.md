The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `start` and `end`. The initial state specifies that `start` and `end` are initially set to `start - 1` and `end - 1`, respectively. After the input operation, `start` and `end` will hold the new values provided by the input.

Given that the input operation directly assigns new values to `start` and `end`, the values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `inc`, `mini`, `m`, `s`, `s1`, and `s2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` and `end` are the new values read from the input, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**
