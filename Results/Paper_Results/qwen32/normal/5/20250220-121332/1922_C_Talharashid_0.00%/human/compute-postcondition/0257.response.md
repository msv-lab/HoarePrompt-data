The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `lst`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `lst` now holds the list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2*m + 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a new defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers read from the input, `start` and `end` are the values read in the last iteration and have been decremented, `inc` is -1, `m` is the input integer, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration.**
