Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is the final cumulative sum after all iterations, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration.**

Explanation: The value of `inc` has been changed to -1. All other variables retain their initial values.
