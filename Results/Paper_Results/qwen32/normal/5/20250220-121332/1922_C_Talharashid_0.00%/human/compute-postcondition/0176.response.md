The only change in the provided code snippet is the assignment `inc = -1`. This changes the value of the variable `inc` from its previous value to `-1`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 0 to `end - 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is `end` (i.e., `len(lst) - 1`), `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is the final accumulated sum based on the minimum absolute difference condition, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration.**
