Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is 0, `start - 1 > -1`. If `start + 1 < len(lst)`, then `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.**

In simpler terms: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000, `i` is `m`, `d1` and `d2` are dictionaries with default integer values, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element, `end` is the last index of `lst`, `inc` is 1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is 0, and `start - 1` is greater than -1. If `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, then `mini` is the smaller value between 11,111,111 and the absolute difference of the first two elements of `lst`. Otherwise, `mini` is 11,111,111.
