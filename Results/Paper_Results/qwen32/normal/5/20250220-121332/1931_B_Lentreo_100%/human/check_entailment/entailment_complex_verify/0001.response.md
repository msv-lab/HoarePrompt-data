Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires determining if it's possible to redistribute water in `n` containers such that each container has the same amount of water, using the operation of pouring water from container `i` to container `j` where `i < j`. The total amount of water is guaranteed to be divisible by `n`.

### Correctness Analysis of the Program

The program follows these steps:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It calculates the total amount of water `total` in the containers.
   - It verifies if `total` is divisible by `n` (though this check is redundant as the problem guarantees that the sum is divisible by `n`).
   - It calculates the `mean` amount of water each container should have if they are to be equalized.
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts:
     - It maintains a running total `curr` of the difference between the current amount of water and the `mean` for each container.
     - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it returns 'NO', indicating that it's not possible to equalize the water using the specified operation.
     - If the loop completes without `curr` going negative, it returns 'YES', indicating that equalization is possible.

### Evaluation Using Annotations

Let's carefully review the annotations:

1. **State Before Function Call:**
   - `nums` is a list of integers representing the water amounts in the containers for a single test case.
   - `n` is the length of `nums`.
   - The sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`.

2. **Inside `func_1`:**
   - `total` is calculated as the sum of `nums`.
   - `mean` is calculated as `total // n`.
   - `curr` is initialized to 0.
   - The loop iterates through each element in `nums`:
     - `curr` is updated by adding the difference between the current element and `mean`.
     - If `curr` becomes negative at any point, the function returns 'NO'.

3. **State During Loop Execution:**
   - `curr` tracks the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the mean.
   - If `curr` is negative, it indicates that the cumulative water deficit cannot be compensated by the remaining containers, making it impossible to equalize the water using the specified operation.

### Challenges to the Original Assessment

The original assessment seems to correctly reason about the logic of the program. However, let's verify if the annotations accurately reflect the program's behavior:

- **Initialization and Calculation:**
  - `total` and `mean` are correctly calculated.
  
- **Loop Execution:**
  - `curr` correctly tracks the cumulative difference.
  - If `curr` goes negative, it correctly returns 'NO'.

- **Final Check:**
  - If the loop completes without `curr` going negative, it correctly returns 'YES'.

### Conclusion

Upon reviewing the annotations and the program, the logic seems correct. The annotations accurately reflect the program's behavior, and the reasoning provided in the original assessment aligns with the program's implementation.

Therefore, the program correctly determines if it's possible to equalize the water in all containers using the specified operation.

**Final: **True**
