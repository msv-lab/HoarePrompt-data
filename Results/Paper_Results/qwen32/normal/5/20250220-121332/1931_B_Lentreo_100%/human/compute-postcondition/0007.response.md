The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of these variables. 

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop index and does not need to be pre-initialized before the loop starts because it is set by the `range` function in the loop head. 

The state of `nums`, `total`, `mean`, and `curr` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. 

So, the only requirement for the loop to execute is that `n` (the length of `nums`) must be greater than 0.

State: **`nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0. `total` is the incorrect sum of the inner lists of `nums`. The `total` is divisible by `n`. `mean` is `total // n`. `curr` is 0.**
