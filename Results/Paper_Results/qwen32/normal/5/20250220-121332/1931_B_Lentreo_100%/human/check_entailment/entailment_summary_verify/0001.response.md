Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to ensure the program's correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires determining if it's possible to redistribute water in `n` containers such that each container has the same amount of water using the operation of pouring water from container `i` to container `j` where `i < j`. The key points are:
1. The total amount of water is divisible by `n`.
2. The operation allows transferring water from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed container.

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of:
1. Reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, reading the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
3. Using the function `func_1` to determine if the water can be equalized.

### Function `func_1` Analysis

The function `func_1` performs the following:
1. Calculates the total amount of water `total` in the containers.
2. Checks if `total` is divisible by `n` (though this check is redundant due to the problem's guarantee).
3. Computes the `mean` amount of water each container should have.
4. Iterates through the list of water amounts:
   - Maintains a cumulative difference `curr` between the current amount of water and the `mean`.
   - If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` going negative, it returns 'YES'.

### Correctness Analysis

The core idea of the program is based on the observation that:
- To equalize the water, the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the mean should never be negative as you move from left to right.
- If `curr` ever goes negative, it means that there isn't enough water in the previous containers to compensate for the deficit in the current container, making it impossible to equalize the water using the specified operation.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided example:

**Input:**
```
6
1
43
2
1 3
5
4 5 2 1 3
3
1 2 3
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```

**Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
NO
YES
```

The program produces the correct output for the provided example.

### Function Summary Reevaluation

The function summary states:
"The function `func_1` evaluates a list of test cases, where each test case consists of a number of containers and their respective water amounts. It checks if it's possible to redistribute the water in the containers such that each container has the same amount. The function returns 'YES' if redistribution is possible for all test cases and 'NO' otherwise."

The summary is slightly misleading. The function `func_1` evaluates a single test case, not a list of test cases. It checks if it's possible to redistribute the water in the containers for a single test case and returns 'YES' or 'NO'.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to equalize the water in all containers using the specified operation. The function `func_1` correctly uses the cumulative difference approach to ensure that the water can be redistributed as required.

**Final: True**
