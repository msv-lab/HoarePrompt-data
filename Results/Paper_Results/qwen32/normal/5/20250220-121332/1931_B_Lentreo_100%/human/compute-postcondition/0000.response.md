The code snippet `n = len(nums)` assigns the variable `n` the length of the list `nums`, which represents the number of test cases. The values of the inner lists and their elements remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the length of `nums`.**
