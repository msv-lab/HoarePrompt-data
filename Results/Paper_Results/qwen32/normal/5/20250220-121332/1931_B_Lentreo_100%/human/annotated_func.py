#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the length of `nums`. `total` is the incorrect sum of the inner lists of `nums`. The `total` is divisible by `n`.
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: curr is 0 and the function does not return 'NO'.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` evaluates a list of test cases, where each test case consists of a number of containers and their respective water amounts. It checks if it's possible to redistribute the water in the containers such that each container has the same amount. The function returns 'YES' if redistribution is possible for all test cases and 'NO' otherwise.
