The code provided calculates the total sum of all the integers in the list of lists `nums`. This means it sums up all the elements within each inner list and then sums up those results to get a single total sum.

Given the initial state, `nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case with the first element being the number of containers (n) and the subsequent elements being the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of the water amounts in each test case is divisible by n, and the total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

The code `total = sum(nums)` is incorrect because `sum(nums)` would attempt to sum the inner lists directly, which is not the intended behavior. To get the correct total sum of all water amounts, we should iterate over each inner list, skip the first element (which is the count of containers), and sum the rest of the elements.

However, based on the given code and the instruction to strictly follow the format and not correct the code, we will proceed with the incorrect summation as specified.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the length of `nums`. `total` is the incorrect sum of the inner lists of `nums`.**
