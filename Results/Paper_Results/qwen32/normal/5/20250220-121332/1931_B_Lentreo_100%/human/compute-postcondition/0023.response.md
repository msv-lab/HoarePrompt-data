Functionality: **The function `func_1` evaluates a list of test cases, where each test case consists of a number of containers and their respective water amounts. It checks if it's possible to redistribute the water in the containers such that each container has the same amount. The function returns 'YES' if redistribution is possible for all test cases and 'NO' otherwise.**
