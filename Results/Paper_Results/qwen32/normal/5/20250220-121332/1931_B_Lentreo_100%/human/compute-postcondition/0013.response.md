The code snippet `curr += nums[i] - mean` modifies the value of `curr` by adding the difference between the `i`-th inner list in `nums` and the `mean`. Given the initial state, this will update `curr` but keep other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0. `total` is the incorrect sum of the inner lists of `nums`. The `total` is divisible by `n`. `mean` is `total // n`. `curr` is `curr + nums[i] - mean`. `curr` is greater than or equal to 0. `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state means that `nums` remains unchanged as a list of lists, each representing a test case. The variables `n`, `total`, `mean`, and `i` also remain unchanged. The value of `curr` is updated to be `curr + nums[i] - mean`, and it is still guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 0. The index `i` is incremented by 1.
