### Reasoning:

The original assessment of the program's correctness is inaccurate. Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the annotated version and the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the operation of pouring water from an earlier container to a later container. The key observation is that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, so there exists a target amount of water `mean` that each container should have in the end.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program performs the following steps:
1. It calculates the total sum of water in the containers and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'NO'.
2. It calculates the target amount of water `mean` that each container should have.
3. It iterates through the containers, maintaining a cumulative difference `curr` between the actual water in the containers and the target amount `mean`.
4. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call, `nums` is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in the containers.
- Inside the function, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of `nums`, and `mean` is the target amount of water each container should have.
- The cumulative difference `curr` is calculated by adding the difference between each container's water amount and `mean`.

#### Evaluation:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it only checks if the cumulative difference ever becomes negative, which is not sufficient. However, this assessment is flawed. The logic of the program is actually correct.

Here's why:
- The program correctly checks if the cumulative difference `curr` ever becomes negative. If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it means that the water in the current and previous containers is less than the target amount `mean`, and there is no way to pour water from future containers to compensate for this deficit because the operation only allows pouring from earlier to later containers.
- If `curr` never becomes negative, it means that the cumulative water in the containers can always be balanced out by the remaining containers to reach the target amount `mean`.

#### Counterexample:
The counterexample provided in the original assessment is incorrect:
- For the input `1 2 3`, the cumulative differences are:
  - After processing the first container: `curr = 1 - 2 = -1` (which is negative).
  - The program correctly returns 'NO' because it's impossible to balance the deficit of -1 units of water with the remaining containers using only forward pours.

Thus, the program is correctly checking the necessary condition for balancing the water amounts across the containers.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
