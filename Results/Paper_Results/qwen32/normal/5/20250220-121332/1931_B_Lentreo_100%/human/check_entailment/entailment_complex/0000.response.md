### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container's index must be less than the destination container's index.

Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of containers and the list of water amounts in those containers.

2. **Sum and Mean Calculation**: The program calculates the total amount of water and the mean amount of water per container (`mean = total // n`), which is the target amount of water each container should have if redistribution is possible.

3. **Redistribution Check**: The program uses a variable `curr` to track the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the target amount (`mean`). If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that to balance the water up to that point, we would need to take water from a container with a lower index, which is not allowed by the problem constraints. Hence, the program returns 'NO' in this case.

4. **Final Check**: If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it means that it is possible to redistribute the water according to the rules, and the program returns 'YES'.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Misinterpretation of Input Structure**: The comment "State of the program right before the function call: nums is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers" is incorrect. `nums` is actually a list of integers representing the water amounts for a single test case, not a list of lists. The number of containers `n` is read separately before `nums` and is not included in `nums`.

- **Function Logic**: The logic of the function `func_1` is correct given the correct understanding of the input structure. It correctly checks if the water can be redistributed following the constraints.

### Correctness:
Given the above points, the program logic is correct for the intended task, but there is a misunderstanding in the comment about the input structure. However, the actual implementation of `func_1` is correct.

**Correctness: True**
