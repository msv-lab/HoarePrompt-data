The code snippet provided increments the variable `curr` by the difference between the sum of the `i`-th inner list in `nums` and the `mean`. 

Given the initial state:
- `nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n+1` integers, with the first integer `n` representing the number of containers and the next `n` integers representing the amounts of water in the containers.
- `total` is the incorrect sum of the inner lists of `nums`, and `total` is divisible by `n`.
- `mean` is calculated as `total // n`.
- `curr` is initialized to 0.

The code modifies the value of `curr` by adding the difference between the sum of the `i`-th inner list and `mean`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0. `total` is the incorrect sum of the inner lists of `nums`. The `total` is divisible by `n`. `mean` is `total // n`. `curr` is `curr + nums[i] - mean`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `curr` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and the difference between the sum of the `i`-th inner list and `mean`. All other variables remain unchanged.
