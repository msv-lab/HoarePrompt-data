Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` containers of water, each containing `a_i` units of water.
- The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
- We can pour water from container `i` to container `j` if `i < j`.
- The goal is to determine if we can make all containers have the same amount of water using the described operation.

### Key Observations:
- The target amount of water for each container is the average, which is `total / n` (where `total` is the sum of all `a_i`).
- To achieve the target, we need to ensure that at every step of the pouring process, the cumulative difference between the current container's water level and the target level should not be negative. This ensures that we can always pour water to the next container without running out of water in the current container.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1(nums)`:**
   - It calculates the total amount of water `total`.
   - It checks if `total` is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'NO' (though the problem guarantees that this condition will always be true).
   - It calculates the target amount of water for each container, `mean = total // n`.
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a cumulative difference `curr` between the current water amount and the target.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it returns 'NO' because it means we cannot pour water from the current container to the next without violating the constraints.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` going negative, it returns 'YES'.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly checks if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by ensuring that the cumulative difference never goes negative.
- This approach leverages the fact that we can only pour water from a container to a container that comes later, and it ensures that we always have enough water in the current container to pour to the next.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
