Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, and `i` is 1. If `a < b < c`, the state remains as described in the if part. Otherwise, the state remains as described in the else part. In either case, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` are unchanged.**
