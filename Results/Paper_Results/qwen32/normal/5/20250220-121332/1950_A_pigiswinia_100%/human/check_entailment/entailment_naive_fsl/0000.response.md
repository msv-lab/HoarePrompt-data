Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly identifies whether the given digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Let's break down the logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It then checks:
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
   - If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
   - For all other cases, it prints "NONE".

The logic is correctly implemented according to the problem description. The conditions cover all possible scenarios for the three digits:
- If the sequence is strictly increasing (`a < b < c`), it is a "STAIR".
- If the sequence first increases and then decreases (`a < b > c`), it is a "PEAK".
- All other sequences are classified as "NONE".

Thus, the program handles all potential cases as per the problem description and works correctly for the given examples and any other valid input within the constraints.
