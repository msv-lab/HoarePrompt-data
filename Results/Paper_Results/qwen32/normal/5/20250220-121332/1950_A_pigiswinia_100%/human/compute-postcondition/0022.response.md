The given code snippet is:

```python
print('PEAK')
```

The `print` statement is outputting a string literal, `'PEAK'`. This string does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` do not influence the output of this specific print statement.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **PEAK**
