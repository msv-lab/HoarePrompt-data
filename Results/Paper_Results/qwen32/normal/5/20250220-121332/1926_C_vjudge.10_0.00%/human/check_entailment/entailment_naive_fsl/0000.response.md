Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range**: The outer loop `for _ in range(N):` should iterate through each test case. However, the inner loop `for i in range(n):` starts from 0 instead of 1, which is incorrect because the problem states that Vladislav wrote integers from 1 to n, inclusive.

2. **Global `soma` Variable**: The `soma` variable is used globally to accumulate the sum across all test cases, which is incorrect. The sum should be reset for each test case.

3. **Function Call Order**: The function `func_1(i)` is called before its definition, which will result in a `NameError`.

4. **Output for Each Test Case**: The program does not output the result for each test case separately. Instead, it attempts to accumulate all sums into a single variable and prints it at the end, which is not the required behavior.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

def solve():
    N = int(input())
    for _ in range(N):
        n = int(input())
        soma = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            soma += func_1(i)
        print(soma)

solve()
```

This corrected version:

- Iterates from 1 to n (inclusive) in the inner loop.
- Resets the `soma` variable for each test case.
- Defines the `func_1` function before it is called.
- Outputs the result for each test case separately.
