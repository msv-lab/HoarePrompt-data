Reasoning:  
The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct according to the problem description.

1. The variable `soma` is initialized outside of the loop that handles each test case. This means that the sum from previous test cases will carry over to the next test case, which is not the desired behavior. Each test case should be independent, and the sum should be reset for each one.

2. The loop `for _ in range(N):` is intended to handle multiple test cases. However, the variable `soma` is not reset to 0 at the beginning of each test case loop, which means that the sum from the previous test case will be included in the sum of the current test case.

3. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a number `n`. However, the loop `for i in range(n):` should start from 1 instead of 0 because the problem states that Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to `n`, inclusive.

4. The program does not print the result for each test case. It should print the result after processing each test case.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0  # Reset soma to 0 for each test case
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Start from 1 to n inclusive
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)  # Print the result for each test case
```

Given these issues, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
