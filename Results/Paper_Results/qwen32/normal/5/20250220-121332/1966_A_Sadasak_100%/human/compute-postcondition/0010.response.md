The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr` and the variable `num`. If there are more elements in `arr`, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the next element in `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least one more element, and `num` will be the next element in the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element remaining, `num` is the next element in `arr`**
