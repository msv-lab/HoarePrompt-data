Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements. If `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k` before the increment, it remains `k`; otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1. Other elements in `frequency_table` remain unchanged. `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
