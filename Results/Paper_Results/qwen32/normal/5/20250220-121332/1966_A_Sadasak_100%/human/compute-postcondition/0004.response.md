The code snippet sets the value of `frequency_table[num]` to `k`. Given that `frequency_table[num]` was previously an integer greater than `k` or initialized to 1, it is now directly set to `k`. The values of `arr` and any other elements in `frequency_table` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element; `frequency_table[num]` is `k`; other elements in `frequency_table` remain unchanged.**
