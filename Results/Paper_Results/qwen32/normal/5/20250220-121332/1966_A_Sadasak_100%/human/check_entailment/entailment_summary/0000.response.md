Reasoning:
The provided program contains a logical flaw in determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the described operations. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to minimize the number of cards by repeatedly exchanging `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards with any numbers.
   - The number of operations is not limited, so we can perform as many as needed to reach the minimum possible number of cards.
   - The key insight is that for each number that appears `x` times in the hand, we can reduce the count to `x % (k-1)` cards because each operation reduces the count by `k` to `k-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the integer `k`.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to help in determining how to minimize the cards, but its implementation and its usage in the main logic are incorrect.
   - `func_1` creates a frequency table where each number's count is capped at `k`. This does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left.
   - The program checks if `k` is in the frequency values, which is not a valid condition to determine the minimum number of cards.
   - The logic for determining the minimum number of cards is not correctly implemented.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each unique number in the list, calculate how many cards will remain after performing the operations, which is `frequency[num] % (k-1)`.
   - Sum these values across all unique numbers to get the minimum number of cards left.

Given the above points, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards left. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
