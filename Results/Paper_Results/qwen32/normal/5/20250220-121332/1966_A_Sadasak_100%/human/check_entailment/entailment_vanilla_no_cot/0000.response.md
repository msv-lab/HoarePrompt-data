Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the allowed operations. Let's analyze why:

1. **Handling of Frequencies**: The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the frequency of each card number, but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This is not necessary and does not help in determining the correct minimum number of cards. The frequency of each card number should be counted accurately.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cards**: The main logic in the program is flawed. It checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table, which is not a valid condition to determine the minimum number of cards. Instead, the program should calculate the minimum number of cards that remain after performing the allowed operations optimally.

3. **Special Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if `k > n`, it correctly outputs `n` because no operations can be performed. However, for other cases, the logic is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the frequency of each card number
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += count % k  # Add the remainder when count is divided by k
    
    # If all cards can be grouped into sets of k, we can reduce to k-1 cards
    if min_cards == 0:
        min_cards = k if n >= k else n
    
    print(min_cards)
```

This corrected program calculates the minimum number of cards by summing up the remainders when the frequency of each card number is divided by `k`. If the sum of these remainders is zero, it means all cards can be grouped into sets of `k`, and we can reduce to `k-1` cards. Otherwise, the sum of remainders gives the minimum number of cards left.
