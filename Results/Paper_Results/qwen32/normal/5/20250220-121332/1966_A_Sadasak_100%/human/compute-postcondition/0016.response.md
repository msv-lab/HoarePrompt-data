Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` representing numbers on cards and an integer `k` such that 2 <= k <= 100. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a unique number from the list `arr`, and each value is the minimum of the number's occurrences in `arr` and `k`.**
