Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The number of test cases, `t`, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. `n` is decremented by the number of test cases processed. For each test case, the value of `s` is computed as `(l//4) + (l - (4*(l//4)))//2` and printed.
Code of the loop:
while n:
    coord = []
    res = 0
    for i in range(4):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        coord.append((x, y))
    coord = sorted(coord)
    p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
    p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2
    res = abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))
    print(res)
    n -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0 and is now `n - 1`, `coord` is the sorted list of `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, `i` is 3, `x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is at least 1, `coord` is `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]` sorted in ascending order first by x-coordinates and then by y-coordinates, `res` is `sqrt((x2 - x1) * (x4 - x3))`, `i` is `3`, `x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is greater than 0, `coord` is a sorted list of tuples `[(a1, b1), (a2, b2), (a3, b3), (a4, b4)]`, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, `i` is 4, `x` and `y` are the two integers from the last input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
