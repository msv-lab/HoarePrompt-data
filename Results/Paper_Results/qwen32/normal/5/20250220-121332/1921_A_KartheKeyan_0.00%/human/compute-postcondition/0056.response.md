Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `coord` is a sorted list of tuples `[(a1, b1), (a2, b2), (a3, b3), (a4, b4)]`, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, `i` is 4, `x` and `y` are the two integers from the last input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `res` has been updated to the absolute value of the square root of `p1` multiplied by the square root of `p2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
