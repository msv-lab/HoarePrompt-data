The value of `n` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0 and is now `n - 1`, `coord` is the sorted list of `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, `i` is 3, `x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**
