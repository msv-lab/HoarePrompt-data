Output State: **`n` is an input integer, each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The number of test cases, `t`, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. `n` is decremented by the number of test cases processed. For each test case, the value of `s` is computed as `(l//4) + (l - (4*(l//4)))//2` and printed.**

In simple terms: `n` has been assigned the value of an integer input. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
