Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[(p1, p2), (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 4, `x` and `y` are the two integers from the last input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop complete, `coord` will contain four tuples, each representing coordinates `(x, y)` that were input during the loop. The variables `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged from their values after the loop has finished executing. The values of `p1` and `p2` are recalculated based on the final state of `coord`.
