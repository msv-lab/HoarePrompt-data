Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `coord` is `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]` sorted in ascending order first by x-coordinates and then by y-coordinates, `res` is `0`, `i` is `3`, `x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`**

In natural language: The value of `p2` is now calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates between the last two points in the `coord` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
