The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Therefore, `coord` now contains three tuples: `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]`. The values of `n`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `y` are taken from the new input but are not further modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `coord` is `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**
