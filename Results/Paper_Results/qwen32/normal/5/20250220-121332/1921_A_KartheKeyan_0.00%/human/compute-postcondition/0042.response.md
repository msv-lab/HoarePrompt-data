Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `coord` is `[]`, `res` is `0`, `i` is `3`, `x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is set to `0`. All other variables retain their initial values.
