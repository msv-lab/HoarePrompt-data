Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `coord` is a sorted list of tuples `[(a1, b1), (a2, b2), (a3, b3), (a4, b4)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 4, `x` and `y` are the two integers from the last input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**

Explanation: The value of `p1` has been updated to be the squared Euclidean distance between the first two points in `coord`, i.e., `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
