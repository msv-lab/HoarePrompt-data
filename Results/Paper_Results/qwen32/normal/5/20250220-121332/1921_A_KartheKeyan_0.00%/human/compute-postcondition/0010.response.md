The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Therefore, `coord` now contains the original tuple `[(x, y)]` plus the newly added tuple `[(x, y)]`, making it `[(x, y), (x, y)]`. The values of `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is `[(x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input.**
