You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The coordinates are provided in random order.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square. It sorts these coordinates and calculates the squared distance between two adjacent corners (which should be the same for a square). It then calculates the area by taking the square root of the squared distance and squaring it again.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Sorting the Coordinates**: Sorting the coordinates as done in the program does not guarantee that the adjacent corners are correctly identified. For example, sorting by x or y coordinates alone does not ensure that the adjacent corners are correctly paired.
2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distance between the first and second coordinates and between the third and fourth coordinates. This might not always give the correct side length of the square.
3. **Area Calculation**: The program calculates the area by multiplying the square roots of the two distances, which is incorrect. The correct approach is to calculate the distance between two adjacent corners and then square that distance.

### Correctness:
The program does not correctly identify the adjacent corners and calculate the side length of the square. Therefore, it will not produce the correct area for all possible inputs.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following input:
```
1
0 0
0 2
2 2
2 0
```
The correct area is \(2 \times 2 = 4\). However, the program might sort the coordinates and calculate distances incorrectly, leading to an incorrect area.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly identify the adjacent corners of the square and calculate the side length. It uses an incorrect method to calculate the area, which will not work for all possible inputs.
