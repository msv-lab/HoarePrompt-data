The code appends a new element to the `prefix` list. This new element is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `prefix` and the (k+1)-th element of `arr`, which is `v`. After this operation, the `prefix` list will have one more element compared to its initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v2, ..., vk, `v` ^ `prefix[-1]`, `v` ^ `prefix[-1]` ^ `v`], `v` is the (k+1)-th element of `arr`**.

In simpler terms, the `prefix` list now includes an additional element which is the result of the XOR operation between the last element of the original `prefix` list and `v`.
