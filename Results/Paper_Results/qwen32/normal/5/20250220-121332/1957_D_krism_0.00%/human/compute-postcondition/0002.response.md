The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each of these strings to an integer, and then stores them in a list named `arr`. This means that `arr` will now hold the integers that were provided in the input.

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is within the range 1 to 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

After executing the code, `arr` is the new list created from the input, and the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.**
