You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a single test case where it reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It calculates a result based on the bitwise XOR prefix sums of the list and prints intermediate and final results. The final result printed is an integer `ans` which is computed by considering the counts of 0s and 1s in specific bit positions across the prefix sums.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's go through the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of tuples (x, y, z) such that:
1. 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ n
2. f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z)

Where f(l, r) = a_l ⊕ a_{l + 1} ⊕ ... ⊕ a_r (bitwise XOR operation).

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `arr` of size `n`.
   
2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - It calculates the prefix XOR array `prefix` where `prefix[i]` is the XOR of all elements from `a_1` to `a_{i-1}`.
   - This is correctly implemented as `prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])`.

3. **Pre and Suf Arrays:**
   - The program initializes two 2D arrays `pre` and `suf` of size 32x2 to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s in the prefix and suffix XOR values at each bit position.
   - It initializes `pre` with all 0s having a count of 1 (since the initial prefix XOR is 0).
   - It populates `suf` by iterating from the end of the array and counting the number of 0s and 1s at each bit position for the suffix XOR values.

4. **Counting Valid Tuples:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of valid tuples.
   - It iterates through each possible `y` position and calculates the XOR value `c` at that position.
   - For each bit position `j`, it updates the `pre` and `suf` arrays accordingly.
   - It then calculates the number of valid tuples by considering the counts of 0s and 1s at the highest bit position of `y` in the `pre` and `suf` arrays.
   - This logic seems incorrect because it does not correctly account for the XOR operation between `f(x, y)` and `f(y, z)` and their comparison with `f(x, z)`.

### Issues in the Code:
- The logic for counting valid tuples is flawed. The program does not correctly compute the XOR values `f(x, y)`, `f(y, z)`, and `f(x, z)` for each tuple (x, y, z).
- The program does not properly iterate through all possible values of `x` and `z` for each `y`, and it does not correctly compare the XOR results.
- The use of `pre` and `suf` arrays does not align with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for counting valid tuples is incorrect, and the program does not properly handle the XOR operations and comparisons required by the problem statement.
