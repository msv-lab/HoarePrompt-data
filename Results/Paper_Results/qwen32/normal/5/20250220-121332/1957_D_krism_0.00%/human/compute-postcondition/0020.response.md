Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, `i` is 31`**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all 32 iterations, the `pre` list will have each of its 32 sublists updated to `[1, 0]`. The other variables such as `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `prefix` remain unchanged, and `i` will be 31, reflecting the last iteration of the loop.
