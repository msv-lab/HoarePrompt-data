Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], except `pre[j][1]` which is 2 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, otherwise `pre[j]` is [2, 1] if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1 and `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, with `pre[2][0]` incremented by 1, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `suf[j]` is [x, y] such that x is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 0 and y is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 1, after checking all 32 bits for each `cur` in `prefix` from `n` down to 1, with `suf[j][1]` decremented by 1 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, and `suf[j][0]` decremented by 1 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, `i` is 1, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 2, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, and `c` is `prefix[1]`. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, then `suf[j][1]` has been decremented by 1. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, then `pre[j][0]` has been incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` has been decremented by 1. Additionally, `suf[j][0]` has been decremented by 1.** 

In simple terms, the value of `suf[j][0]` has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
