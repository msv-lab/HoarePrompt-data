The code snippet `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the second element of the `j`-th sublist in the `suf` list by 1. Given the initial state, all other variables remain unchanged except for `suf[j][1]`.

Since `j` is 0, the second element of the first sublist in `suf` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 1 is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `suf[j]` is [x, y] such that x is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 0, and y is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `cur` is `prefix[n]`, `j` is 0, and the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1; `suf[0][1]` is incremented by 1.**
