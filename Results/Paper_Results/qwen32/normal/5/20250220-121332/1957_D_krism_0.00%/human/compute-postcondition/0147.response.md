Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `i` is 3, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 1, `y` is `arr[2]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, and `c` is `prefix[3]`. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, then `pre[0]` is `[1, 3]` and `suf[0]` is `[1, 0]`; otherwise, `pre[0]` is `[2, 2]` and `suf[0]` is `[0, 1]`. For `j` from 1 to 31, `pre[j]` is `[1, 3]` if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, otherwise `[2, 2]`, and `suf[j]` is `[0, 1]` except `suf[k][1]` is 0 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, or `suf[1][0]` is decremented by 1 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0. The value of `ans` is recalculated as `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][0] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes, taking into account the conditions and modifications specified in both the if and else parts.
