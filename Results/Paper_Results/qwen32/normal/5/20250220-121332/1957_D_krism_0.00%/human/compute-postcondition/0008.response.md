The only variable in the loop head is `v`, which is the loop variable iterating over `arr`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next element in `arr` that `v` will take.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4,
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5,
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9,
- `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v2, ..., vk, `v` ^ `prefix[-1]`],
- `v` is the k-th element of `arr`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was the k-th element of `arr`. For the next iteration, `v` will be the (k+1)-th element of `arr`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v2, ..., vk, `v` ^ `prefix[-1]`], `v` is the (k+1)-th element of `arr`**
