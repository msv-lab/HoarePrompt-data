The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the list `num`. Since the loop iterates backward from the last index of `num` to 0, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration. According to the loop statement, `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `num` is a list of integers with at least one element, and the loop iterates from the last index of `num` to 0. If `num[i]` is equal to '0', `counter` is 1, otherwise, `counter` remains 0 and the loop is broken.

Let's adjust the state for the next iteration:

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current index that was checked. For the next iteration, `i` should be decremented by 1. The list `num` remains unchanged.

If `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have terminated. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 0.

State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the current index decremented by 1, and `i` must be greater than 0**.

Since we know `i` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, we can specify the state more precisely. If `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it would be 0 now, and the loop would terminate. Therefore, `i` must have been greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the current index decremented by 1, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0**.

To be more precise and ensure the loop can execute one more time:
State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the current index decremented by 1, and `i` must be greater than 0**.

Therefore, the final state before the next iteration is:
State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the current index decremented by 1**.
