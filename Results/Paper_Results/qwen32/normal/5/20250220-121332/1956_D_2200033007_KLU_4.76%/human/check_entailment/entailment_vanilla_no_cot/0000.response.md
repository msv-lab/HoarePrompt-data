Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program only handles specific cases (arrays of length 2 and arrays of length greater than 2) and outputs hardcoded results. It does not actually compute the MEX for any subarray, nor does it perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array. The solution should dynamically calculate the MEX for each possible subarray and perform the operations to achieve the maximum sum.
