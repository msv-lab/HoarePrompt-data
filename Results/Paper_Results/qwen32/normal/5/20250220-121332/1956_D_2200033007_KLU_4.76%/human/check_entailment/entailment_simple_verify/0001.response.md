Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. It simply prints hardcoded outputs based on the length of the array without considering the actual values in the array and the operations that can be performed to maximize the sum.

Let's break down the issues in the code:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the array as a list of strings and does not convert them to integers. This will cause issues when trying to perform numerical operations on the array elements.

2. **Hardcoded Outputs**: The function `func_1` only checks the length of the array and prints hardcoded outputs. For an array of length 2, it outputs `4 1` and `1 2`, which is correct for the specific example `[0, 1]`. However, for other arrays of length 2, this might not be correct. For arrays of any other length, it outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect for most cases.

3. **Lack of MEX Calculation and Array Manipulation**: The program does not calculate the MEX of any subarray and does not perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array. It simply relies on predefined outputs, which is not a valid approach for solving the problem as described.

4. **Incorrect Output for Given Test Cases**: While the program outputs the correct result for the first test case `[0, 1]`, it fails for the other test cases. For example, for the array `[1, 3, 9]`, the program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect because no operations are needed to achieve the sum of 13, but the program does not demonstrate the correct logic to handle other cases where operations could be beneficial.

In conclusion, the program does not implement the required logic to find the maximum sum and the sequence of operations to achieve it. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
