The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a formatted string. The initial state provides information about the variables `c` and `m`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'4 1'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes `c` as a list of integers with specific constraints, and `m` as an integer with a value of 0.
2. The `print` statement is `print(f'4 1')`, which uses an f-string to format the output. However, there are no variables inside the curly braces `{}` of the f-string, indicating that no variable substitution occurs.
3. Therefore, the string `'4 1'` is printed exactly as it is.

Output: **4 1**
