The code snippet provided increments the variable `ret` by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the integer input by the user; `s` is a non-empty list of characters; `ret` is 1; `thorn` is 0; the current character `i` is '@'**.
