Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters; `i` is the next character in the list `s`; `thorn` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `len`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `thorn` is incremented by 1, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
