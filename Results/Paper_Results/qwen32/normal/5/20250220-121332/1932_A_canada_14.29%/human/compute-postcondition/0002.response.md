The code snippet `s = list(input())` takes an input string from the user and converts it into a list of characters. The variable `len` is an input integer, but it is not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, its value remains unchanged. The variable `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and its value also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string.**
