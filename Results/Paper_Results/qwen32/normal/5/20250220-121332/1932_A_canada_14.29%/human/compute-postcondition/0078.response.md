To determine what will be printed by the `print(ret)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - This indicates that `t` is a loop counter or some kind of iteration limit, but it's not directly relevant to the `ret` variable.
   
2. `len` is the input integer.
   - This indicates the length of the input string `s`.

3. `s` is a list of characters from the input string.
   - This is the string from which we are counting the '@' characters.

4. `ret` is the total number of '@' characters in `s`.
   - This is the variable we are interested in for the `print` statement. It's the count of '@' characters in the list `s`.

5. `thorn` is 0 if the loop completes without encountering two consecutive '*' characters, or 2 if the loop breaks due to two consecutive '*' characters.
   - This variable is not used in the `print(ret)` statement, so it's not relevant for determining the output.

### Analysis:
The variable `ret` is explicitly stated to be the total number of '@' characters in the list `s`. The `print(ret)` statement will output the value of `ret`, which is the count of '@' characters.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ret)` statement will output the number of '@' characters in the input string `s`.

### Output:
Output: **ret (where ret is the number of '@' characters in the input string `s`)**
