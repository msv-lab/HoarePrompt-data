The code snippet provided is `len = int(input())`. This line of code updates the value of the variable `len` by reading an integer input from the user.

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ret` is the total number of '@' characters in `s`; `thorn` is 0 if the loop completes without encountering two consecutive '*' characters, or 2 if the loop breaks due to two consecutive '*' characters

After executing the code snippet, the value of `len` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the integer input by the user; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ret` is the total number of '@' characters in `s`; `thorn` is 0 if the loop completes without encountering two consecutive '*' characters, or 2 if the loop breaks due to two consecutive '*' characters**
