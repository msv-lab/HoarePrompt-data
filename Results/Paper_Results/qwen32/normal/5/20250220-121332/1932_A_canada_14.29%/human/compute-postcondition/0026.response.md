Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters; `ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0; if the current character `i` is '*', `thorn` is incremented by 1, and if `thorn` equals 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; if the current character `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` remains 0; `i` is the next character in the list `s`.**
