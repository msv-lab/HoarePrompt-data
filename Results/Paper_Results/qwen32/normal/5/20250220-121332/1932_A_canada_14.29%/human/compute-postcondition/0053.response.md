Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 2; the current character `i` equals '*'; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables `t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`, `thorn`, and `i` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
