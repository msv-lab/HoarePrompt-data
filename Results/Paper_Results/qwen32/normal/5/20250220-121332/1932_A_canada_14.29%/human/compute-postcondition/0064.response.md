Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `i` is the next character in the list `s`; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is either 1 or 3. If `thorn` is 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.**
