The given code snippet increments the count of `x` in the `num_of_lens` list by 1. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least two integers, `x` is the next element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms: The count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
