The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. This means that if `x` was not already a key in `num_of_lens`, it will now be a key with the value `1`. If `x` was already a key, its value will be overwritten to `1`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and `1` as its value, `x` is the next element in `num_list` after the previously processed element.**

In simple terms, the dictionary `num_of_lens` now includes `x` with a value of `1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
