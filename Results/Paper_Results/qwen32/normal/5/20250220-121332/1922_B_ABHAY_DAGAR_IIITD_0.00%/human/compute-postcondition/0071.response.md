Postcondition: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is a list containing `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values (and must have at least one key-value pair), `total_count` is 0, and `test_cases` must be greater than the current iteration count. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is set to `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
