Postcondition: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `num_list` (and must have at least one key-value pair), `total_count` is `total_count` + `cnt_current`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res` + `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is also greater than or equal to 3, `res` is further updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `cnt` is `cnt_next`.**
