The given code snippet modifies the value of `res` by adding the result of the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to it. The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, and `total_count` remain unchanged as per the provided initial state. The value of `cnt` is not updated in this snippet and is used as is.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is unchanged from the previous iteration, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**
