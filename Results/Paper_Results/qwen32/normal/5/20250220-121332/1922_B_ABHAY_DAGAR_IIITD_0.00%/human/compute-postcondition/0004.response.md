The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary `num_of_lens`. This does not affect the values of `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, or `num_list`. Therefore, the output state includes the same preconditions for these variables, with `num_of_lens` being an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.**
