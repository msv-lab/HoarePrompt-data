The code snippet simply appends the value of `res` to the `results` list. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state, except for `results`, which now includes the newly appended `res` value.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is a list containing `res` (computed as described) and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**
