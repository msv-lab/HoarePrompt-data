The code snippet sets `total_count` to 0. This affects the value of `total_count` directly, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1; `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers from the input; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `num_list`; `total_count` is 0; `res` is 0.**
