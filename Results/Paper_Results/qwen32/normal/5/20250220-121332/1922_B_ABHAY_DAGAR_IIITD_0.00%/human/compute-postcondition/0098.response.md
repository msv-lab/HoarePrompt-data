The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. 

Given the initial state, the variable `x` is the next element in `num_list`. The dictionary `num_of_lens` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is implied that it exists and contains keys that correspond to elements in `num_list` with their respective counts.

After executing the code, the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` will be incremented by 1. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least two integers, `x` is the next element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1.**
