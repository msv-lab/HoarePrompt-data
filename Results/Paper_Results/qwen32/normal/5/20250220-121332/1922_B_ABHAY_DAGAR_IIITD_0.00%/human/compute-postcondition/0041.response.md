Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is `total_count` from the previous iteration plus `cnt`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**

In simple terms, `total_count` has been incremented by the value of `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. If `cnt` was greater than or equal to 2, `res` has been updated accordingly. Otherwise, `res` remains the same.
