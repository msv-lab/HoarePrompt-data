The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, and it iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. To ensure that the loop executes, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair. This means that `num_list` must contain at least one integer, so that `num_of_lens` can be populated with at least one unique integer and its count.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `num_list` (and must have at least one key-value pair), `total_count` is 0, `res` is 0**
