The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. If there are more values to iterate over in `num_of_lens.values()`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is set to `cnt_next`, which means `cnt_next` is the current value of `cnt` from the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` should be the next value in the `num_of_lens.values()`.

Since the loop iterates over the values of `num_of_lens`, and assuming that `cnt_next` was the last value processed, `cnt` should now be the next value in the sequence of values from `num_of_lens`.

State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `num_list` (and must have at least one key-value pair), `total_count` is `total_count` + `cnt`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**
