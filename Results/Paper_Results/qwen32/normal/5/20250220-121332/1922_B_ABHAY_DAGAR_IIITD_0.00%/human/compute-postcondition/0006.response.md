Postcondition: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary and `x` is a key in `num_of_lens`. The current value of `x` is such that it exists as a key in `num_of_lens`.**
