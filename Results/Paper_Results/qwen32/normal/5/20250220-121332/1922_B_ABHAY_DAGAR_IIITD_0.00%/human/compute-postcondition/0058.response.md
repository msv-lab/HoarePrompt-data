The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_list`. If `num_list` has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` was the last element processed from `num_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_list` must have at least one more element that has not been processed yet. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `res`, `total_count`, and `num_of_lens`) do not need to be adjusted in the loop head.

Let's assume that `num_list` has at least one more element after the current `x`. The next `x` will be the next element in `num_list`.

State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is a list containing `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer remaining, `res` is the sum of all combinations of 3 items from counts `cnt >= 3` and all combinations of 2 items from counts `cnt >= 2` multiplied by the cumulative `total_count` at that point, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, and `test_cases` must be greater than the current iteration count. If `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`, `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `x` is added as a key to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1. `x` is the next element in `num_list`.**
