Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is a list containing `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values (and must have at least one key-value pair), `total_count` is `total_count + cnt_next`, `cnt` is `cnt_next`**

In simple terms, the value of `res` has been updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
