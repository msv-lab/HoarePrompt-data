Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is a list containing `res` plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `results` remains `res`. `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values (and must have at least one key-value pair), `total_count` is `total_count + cnt_next`, `cnt` is `cnt_next`, `res` is `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `res` has been updated to include the additional term `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state descriptions.
