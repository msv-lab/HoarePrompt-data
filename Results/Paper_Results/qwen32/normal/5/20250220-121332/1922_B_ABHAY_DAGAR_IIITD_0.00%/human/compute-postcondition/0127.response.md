The code snippet provided only increments `total_count` by the value of `cnt`. No other variables are modified by this specific line of code. Therefore, the only change in the output state is the updated value of `total_count`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `num_list` (and must have at least one key-value pair), `total_count` is `total_count` + `cnt`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to `res` + `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. Additionally, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res` + `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
