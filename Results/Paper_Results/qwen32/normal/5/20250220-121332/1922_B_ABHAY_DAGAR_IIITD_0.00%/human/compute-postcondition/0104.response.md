Postcondition: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least two integers, `x` is the next element in `num_list`. If `x` is in `num_of_lens`, `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1.**
