The code assigns the value `1` to the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` having the value `1`, and `x` is a key in `num_of_lens`.**
