The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` sets the count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` to 1. This means if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`, its count is overwritten to 1, and if `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, it is added with a count of 1.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the count of `x` is set to 1.**
This means that the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is now 1, and all other variables retain their previous states.
