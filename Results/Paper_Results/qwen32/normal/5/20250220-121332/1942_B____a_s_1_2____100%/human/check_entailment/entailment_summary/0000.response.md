Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array `a` in reverse order and calculating the permutation `p` based on the MEX value and the current element in `a`. However, the logic used to calculate `mex` is flawed. The `mex` should be the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation `p`, and it should be updated correctly as elements are added to `p`.

The current implementation sets `mex` initially to `n` and then decrements it as elements are added to `p`, which does not guarantee that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not yet used. This can lead to incorrect permutations, especially when the values in `a` are negative or when the smallest non-negative integer not used has already been skipped.

To fix the implementation, we need to maintain a set of used numbers and find the smallest non-negative integer not in that set as `mex` at each step. Here's a corrected version of the logic:

1. Initialize an empty set to keep track of used numbers.
2. For each element in `a` in reverse order:
   - Find the smallest non-negative integer not in the set (this is the `mex`).
   - Calculate the corresponding element in `p` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - Add the calculated element to the set of used numbers.
3. Print the resulting permutation `p`.

Given the original program does not correctly calculate `mex` and may produce incorrect permutations, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
