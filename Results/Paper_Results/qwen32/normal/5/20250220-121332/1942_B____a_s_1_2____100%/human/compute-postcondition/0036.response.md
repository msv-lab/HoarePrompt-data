The code snippet `p = [-1] * n` changes the list `p` to a new list of length `n` where every element is `-1`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `mex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with each element equal to `-1`, and `mex` is the minimum value in the list `p`.**

In natural language: The list `p` is now a list of `-1` values with length `n`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `mex` retain their initial values.
