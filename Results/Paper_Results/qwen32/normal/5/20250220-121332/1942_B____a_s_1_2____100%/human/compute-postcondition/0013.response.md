The code snippet updates the value of `p[i]` to be `mex - a[i]`. Given the initial state and the code, we can determine the updated value of `p[i]` as follows:

- `i` is 0.
- `p[i]` (which is `p[0]`) is initially `mex - a[1]`.
- The code updates `p[i]` (which is `p[0]`) to `mex - a[i]` (which is `mex - a[0]`).

Thus, `p[0]` is now `mex - a[0]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list where the 1st element is `mex - a[0]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is `min(min(n, n - a[1]), min(n, n - a[1]) - a[1])`, `i` is 0**
