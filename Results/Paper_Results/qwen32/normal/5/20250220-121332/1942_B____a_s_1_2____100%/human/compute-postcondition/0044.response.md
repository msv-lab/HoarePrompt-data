The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, and it must still be greater than or equal to `0`.

Given that `i` is currently `n - 1`, the next value of `i` should be `n - 2` to continue the loop. The value of `n` does not need to be changed because the loop condition depends on `i` and not on `n` directly.

State: **`t` is `t-2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with the `i`-th element equal to `mex - a[i]` (where `i` is `n - 1`), the rest equal to `-1`, `mex` is `min(mex, p[i])`, `i` is `n - 2`**
