Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating backwards through the array `a` and calculating `p` based on the `mex` value, but the approach is flawed. The key issue is that the calculation of `mex` is incorrect and does not properly reflect the minimum non-negative integer that hasn't been used yet in the permutation `p`.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to maintain a set (or a list) of available numbers and iteratively assign the smallest available number to `p[i]` based on the value of `a[i]`. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        available = set(range(n))  # Set of available numbers from 0 to n-1
        
        for i in range(n):
            mex = min(available)  # Find the minimum available number
            p[i] = mex - a[i]     # Calculate p[i]
            available.remove(mex) # Remove the used number from available set
            
        print(*p)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that we always use the smallest available number to construct the permutation `p` according to the given array `a`.
