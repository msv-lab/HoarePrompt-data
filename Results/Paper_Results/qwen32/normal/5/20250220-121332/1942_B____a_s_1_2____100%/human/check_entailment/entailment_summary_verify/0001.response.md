### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine whether the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to construct a permutation `p` from an array `a` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- The `MEX` of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a` of length `n`.
- It initializes `p` as an array of `-1` values of length `n` and `mex` as `n`.
- It iterates over `a` in reverse order, calculating `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]` and updating `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.
- Finally, it prints the constructed permutation `p`.

#### Function Summary:
- The function reads `t` and processes each test case.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `a`.
- It constructs `p` by iterating over `a` in reverse and using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`.
- It updates `mex` to ensure it remains the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is a valid starting point because initially, all numbers from `0` to `n-1` are available.

2. **Reverse Iteration**:
   - The program iterates over `a` in reverse order. This is a crucial step because it allows the program to correctly determine the `MEX` at each step.
   - For each `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i] = mex - a[i]`. This formula is derived from the problem statement, which rearranges to `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.

3. **Updating `mex`**:
   - After calculating `p[i]`, the program updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p` (up to the current point in the reverse iteration).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.

#### Verification:
- The approach taken by the program is correct. By iterating in reverse and using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`, the program effectively constructs a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given relationship with `a`.
- The update of `mex` ensures that the constructed permutation is valid and contains all integers from `0` to `n-1` exactly once.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly constructs the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the relationship `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

**Final:** **True**
