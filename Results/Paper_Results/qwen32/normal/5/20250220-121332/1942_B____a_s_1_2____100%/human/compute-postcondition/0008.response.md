The code snippet `mex = min(mex, p[i])` updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `p[i]`.

Given the initial state, `mex` is initially `n`. The value of `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` for the `i`-th element, and `-1` for all other elements. Since `mex` is initially `n`, `p[i]` is initially `n - a[i]` for the `i`-th element.

After executing the line `mex = min(mex, p[i])`, the value of `mex` will be the smaller of its current value (`n`) and `p[i]` (`n - a[i]`).

Since `a[i]` is an integer and `n` is at least `1`, the value of `n - a[i]` can be less than, equal to, or greater than `n`. However, because `mex` is defined as the minimum value that is not in the list `a`, the value of `p[i]` (which is `n - a[i]`) is always non-negative or `-1` (if `n < a[i]`).

Therefore, the new value of `mex` will be `min(n, n - a[i])`. Since `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `a`, and `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`, the new `mex` will be the smaller of `n` and `n - a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is `min(n, n - a[i])`**.
