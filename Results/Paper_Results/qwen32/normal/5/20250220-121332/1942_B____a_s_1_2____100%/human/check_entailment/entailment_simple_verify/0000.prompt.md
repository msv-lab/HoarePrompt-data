You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given a permutation `p` of integers from `0` to `n-1`.
- We are also given an array `a` of length `n` where `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- We need to reconstruct the permutation `p` from the array `a`.

### Key Points:
- `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of `p`.
- The program iterates from the end of `a` to the beginning to construct `p`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)
```

### Issues in the Program:
1. **MEX Calculation**: The program initializes `mex` to `n` and then updates it as `mex = min(mex, p[i])` in each iteration. This approach does not correctly calculate the MEX of the current prefix of `p` because it does not account for the presence of elements in `p` as the loop progresses.
2. **Correct MEX Calculation**: The MEX should be recalculated at each step based on the current elements in `p`. This can be efficiently handled using a set to keep track of used elements and finding the smallest missing integer.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
-2 1 2
```
- The correct permutation `p` should be `[2, 0, 1]` as per the example.
- The provided program will output `[2, 0, 0]` because the `mex` is not recalculated correctly after the first iteration.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly calculate the MEX for each prefix of `p` and thus does not construct the correct permutation `p` for all cases. The MEX should be recalculated at each step based on the current elements in `p`, which the provided program does not do.
