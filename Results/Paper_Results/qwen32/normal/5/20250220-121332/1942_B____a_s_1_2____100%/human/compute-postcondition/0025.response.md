The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `0`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be decremented by 1.

Given that `t` and `a` do not appear in the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted. The same applies to `p` and `mex` as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with the `i`-th element equal to `n - a[i]` and all other elements equal to `-1`, `mex` is `min(mex, p[i])`, `i` is `n - 2`**
