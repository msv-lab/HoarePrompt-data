The code snippet `p = [-1] * n` assigns a new list to `p` where every element is `-1` and the length of the list is `n`. This means the previous value of `p` is replaced with this new list. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `mex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`; `n` is the length of the new list `a` input by the user; `a` is the new list of integers input by the user; `p` is a list of length `n` with all elements equal to `-1`; `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not yet appeared in the list `p`.**
