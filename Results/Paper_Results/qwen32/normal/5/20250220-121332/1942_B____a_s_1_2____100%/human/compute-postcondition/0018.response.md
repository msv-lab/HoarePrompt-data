The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `n` is already defined in the initial state as the integer input by the user such that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, the value of `n` remains the same after this line of code is executed. The other variables `t`, `a`, `p`, and `mex` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not yet appeared in the list `p`.**
