The code assigns the last element of the list `nums` to the variable `last`. Since `nums` is a list of integers, `nums[-1]` refers to the last integer in the list. The variables `t`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged as per the given code snippet. `curr` is no longer valid, which means it is not used or defined in this context.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is the new list of integers read from input, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `curr` is no longer valid.**
