The code snippet initializes a new variable `curr` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, or `last`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `t`, `n`, `nums`, and `last`, with the addition of `curr` being set to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers read from input; `last` is the last element of `nums`; `curr` is 0.**
