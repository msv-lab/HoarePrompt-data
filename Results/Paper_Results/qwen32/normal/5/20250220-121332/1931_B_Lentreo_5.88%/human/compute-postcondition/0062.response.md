The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes several variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, `curr`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of the variables does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print('NO')` statement is executed.
2. The string `'NO'` is directly printed to the console without any reference to the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
