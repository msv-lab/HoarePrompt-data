The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `nums`. To adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the next element in the list `nums`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least one element.
- `last` is the last element of `nums`.
- If `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last element of the list `nums`, and `last` was also the last element of the list `nums`. For the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in the list `nums` if it exists.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least one element, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `i` is the next element in `nums` after the last one considered, `curr` is updated based on the previous value of `i` and `last`.**

However, since we are only concerned with the objects in the loop head, we need to adjust only `i` to be the next element in `nums`. We do not need to adjust `last` or `curr` in the state description for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in `nums` after the last one considered.**
