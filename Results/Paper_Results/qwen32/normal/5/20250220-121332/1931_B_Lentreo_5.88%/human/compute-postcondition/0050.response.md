The value of `curr` is updated by adding `i - last` to it. The values of `_`, `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `i` is not 0, `curr` is `curr + i - last`.**
