### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary in detail to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have `n` containers with water amounts `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
- The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
- We can pour water from container `i` to container `j` if `i < j`.
- We need to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates the sum of differences between each non-zero element and the last element.
- If this sum is zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment claims the program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if the water can be distributed equally among the containers.
- The assessment suggests a corrected version that checks if the cumulative sum of water amounts up to each container is less than or equal to the expected sum for that number of containers.

#### Analysis:
1. **Program Logic**:
   - The program calculates `last` as the last element in the list `nums`.
   - It then iterates through `nums`, adding `i - last` to `curr` for each non-zero `i`.
   - If `curr` is zero at the end, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

2. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program's logic is flawed because it only considers the difference between each element and the last element.
   - It does not account for the cumulative sum of water amounts and whether they can be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves checking if the cumulative sum of water amounts up to each container can be adjusted to make all containers have the average amount of water.
   - This means checking if the prefix sums are within the bounds of what is needed to achieve the target amount for each container.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly determine if the water can be distributed equally among the containers. It only checks the difference between each element and the last element, which is insufficient.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
