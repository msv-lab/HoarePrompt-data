The code snippet provided updates the value of `curr` by adding the difference between the current element `i` and the previous element `last`. The values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, and `last` remain unchanged. The updated value of `curr` is the previous value of `curr` plus `i - last`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in `nums` after the last one considered, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`.**
