Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is the new list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `i` is the second-to-last element of `nums`, `curr` is increased by `i - last`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `curr` is updated by adding the difference between the second-to-last element (`i`) and the last element (`last`) of the list `nums`. All other variables retain their initial values.
