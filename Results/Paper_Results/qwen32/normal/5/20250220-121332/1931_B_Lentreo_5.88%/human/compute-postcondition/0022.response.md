The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` is not used within the loop body, we only need to adjust `t` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since the loop iterates `t` times, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the next iteration.

The other variables (`n`, `nums`, `last`, `curr`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from input, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `curr` is the sum of (i - last) for all i in nums except the last element, where i is not 0. If `curr` is 0, then no further changes are made to `curr`. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged and is not equal to 0.**
