The code reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `nums`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers read from input.**
