To determine the output state after running the `dsu.union(u, v, w)` command, we need to understand the impact of the union operation on the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) structure. The union operation typically merges two sets and updates the parent pointers and possibly other attributes like the minimum edge weight.

Given the initial state, the union operation will:
1. Merge the sets containing `u` and `v`.
2. Update the parent of one of the roots to the other.
3. Update the minimum edge weight if necessary.

Let's break down the changes:

- `dsu.union(u, v, w)` will merge the sets containing `u` and `v`. This means that the parent of one of the roots will be updated to the other. The specific root chosen for the parent can vary based on the implementation, but for simplicity, let's assume `parent_u` becomes the parent of `parent_v`.
- `_min_edge` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and the weight `w` of the edge connecting `u` and `v` if `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v` after the union. However, since `u` and `v` are in different sets initially, `parent_u` will not be equal to `parent_v` before the union, and after the union, `_min_edge` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and `w`.

The other variables (`graph`, `edges`, `parent_u`, `parent_v`, `node_u`, `node_v`) remain unchanged except for the internal state of the `dsu` object.

Output State: **`graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times, `edges` is a list of `m-1` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements where the sets containing `u` and `v` are now merged and `_min_edge` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `w`, `parent_u` is updated to `dsu.find(u)`, `parent_v` is updated to `dsu.find(v)`, `_min_edge` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `w` if `parent_u` was equal to `parent_v` after the union (which it is not in this case, but `_min_edge` will be updated to `w` as part of the union operation), `node_u` and `node_v` are set to `u` and `v` respectively if `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, otherwise `node_u` and `node_v` remain `-1`.**

In simpler terms, the sets containing `u` and `v` are merged in the DSU structure, and `_min_edge` is updated to the weight of the edge connecting `u` and `v`. The other variables remain unchanged.
