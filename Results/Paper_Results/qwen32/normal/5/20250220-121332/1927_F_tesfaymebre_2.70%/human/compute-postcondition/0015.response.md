Output State: **`res` is the result of `dfs(nei, curr, path)`, `curr` is an integer, `parent` is an integer, `path` is a list of integers, `colors[curr]` is 1, `graph[curr]` is a list with at least one element, `nei` is the next neighbor in `graph[curr]`, `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`.**

In simple terms: The variable `set_res` has been created and contains the unique elements of `res`. All other variables retain their initial values.
