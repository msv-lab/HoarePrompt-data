Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function constructs a graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, then identifies the minimum edge weight in a spanning tree and performs a depth-first search starting from the node associated with this minimum edge. It prints the minimum edge weight and the number of nodes in the resulting path, followed by the sequence of nodes in the path.

    colors[curr] = 2
    return []
    #The program returns an empty list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search starting from the current vertex `curr`. It avoids revisiting the `parent` vertex and tracks the current path in `path`. The function returns the path if it reaches a vertex with a specific color, or if it finds a path containing `node_v` through recursive calls. If no such path is found, it returns an empty list.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. This function does not take any input parameters and does not return any values directly. It likely orchestrates the reading of test cases and the execution of the main logic through other functions.

        func_6()

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any input parameters and does not return any values directly. It reads the number of test cases and executes the logic defined in `func_6` for each test case.
