Output State: **`graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times; `edges` is a list of `m-2` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple; `w`, `u`, and `v` are set to the next tuple in `edges`; `dsu` is a DSU object with an updated internal state reflecting the union of the sets containing `u` and `v` from the previous iteration; `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight found so far, and `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes corresponding to `_min_edge` if `_min_edge` was updated in the previous iteration, otherwise, they remain `-1`; `parent_u` is the root parent of `u` as found by `dsu.find(u)`; `parent_v` is the root parent of `v` as found by `dsu.find(v)` after the current iteration.**

In natural language: The state of `graph`, `edges`, `w`, `u`, `v`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `node_u`, `node_v`, and `parent_u` remains unchanged. The only variable that is updated is `parent_v`, which now holds the root parent of `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method.
