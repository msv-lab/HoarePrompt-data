The code snippet provided is `node_v = v`. This line of code updates the value of `node_v` to the value of `v`.

Given the initial state:
- `graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times.
- `edges` is a list of `m-2` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple.
- `w`, `u`, and `v` are set to the next tuple in `edges`.
- `dsu` is a DSU object with an updated internal state reflecting the union of the sets containing `u` and `v` from the current iteration.
- `_min_edge` is the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`.
- `node_u` is `u`.
- `node_v` are the nodes corresponding to `_min_edge` if `_min_edge` was updated in the previous iteration, otherwise, they remain `-1`.
- `parent_u` is the root parent of `u` as found by `dsu.find(u)` after the current iteration.
- `parent_v` is the root parent of `v` as found by `dsu.find(v)` after the current iteration.

The only change made by the code is that `node_v` is set to the value of `v`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times; `edges` is a list of `m-2` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple; `w`, `u`, and `v` are set to the next tuple in `edges`; `dsu` is a DSU object with an updated internal state reflecting the union of the sets containing `u` and `v` from the current iteration; `_min_edge` is the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`; `node_u` is `u`; `node_v` is `v`; `parent_u` is the root parent of `u` as found by `dsu.find(u)` after the current iteration; `parent_v` is the root parent of `v` as found by `dsu.find(v)` after the current iteration.**
