The code snippet `node_u = u` assigns the value of `u` to `node_u`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times; `edges` is a list of `m-2` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple; `w`, `u`, and `v` are set to the next tuple in `edges`; `dsu` is a DSU object with an updated internal state reflecting the union of the sets containing `u` and `v` from the current iteration; `_min_edge` is the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`; `node_u` is `u`; `node_v` are the nodes corresponding to `_min_edge` if `_min_edge` was updated in the previous iteration, otherwise, they remain `-1`; `parent_u` is the root parent of `u` as found by `dsu.find(u)` after the current iteration; `parent_v` is the root parent of `v` as found by `dsu.find(v)` after the current iteration.**
