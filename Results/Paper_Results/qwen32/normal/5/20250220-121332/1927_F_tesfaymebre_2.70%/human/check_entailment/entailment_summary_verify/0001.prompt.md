You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 8 : The function `func_7` does not accept any input parameters and does not return any values directly. It reads the number of test cases and executes the logic defined in `func_6` for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices (`n`) and edges (`m`).
   - It reads the edges and stores them in a list `edges` and also builds an adjacency list `graph`.

2. **Sorting Edges:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weights. This is not necessary for finding the cycle with the minimum weight edge, and it could lead to inefficiencies.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Structure:**
   - The program uses a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) structure to detect cycles.
   - When processing edges in descending weight order, it finds cycles but does not correctly identify the cycle with the minimum weight edge.

4. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program attempts to find a cycle using DFS after identifying a cycle with the DSU structure.
   - However, the DFS function (`dfs`) is not correctly implemented to find the cycle in the context of the DSU structure. The `dfs` function is supposed to find a cycle but is not correctly handling the cycle detection and path reconstruction.

5. **Cycle Reconstruction:**
   - The program uses a DFS to reconstruct the cycle but does not correctly identify the cycle that includes the minimum weight edge.
   - The variable `graph` is not correctly scoped within the `func_6` function, leading to issues with the DFS function not having access to the correct adjacency list.

6. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the minimum weight of the edge found in a cycle and the vertices of the cycle.
   - However, the cycle found does not necessarily have the minimum weight edge, and the cycle reconstruction is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program has several issues:
- Incorrect sorting of edges.
- Incorrect cycle detection and reconstruction.
- Scope issues with the adjacency list `graph`.
- Incorrect handling of the DSU structure for cycle detection.

These issues mean that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
