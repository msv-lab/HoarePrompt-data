To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_6()` does. However, the function `func_6()` is not defined in the given context. Without the definition of `func_6()`, we cannot determine the specific changes it makes to the variables or the program state.

Given the initial state and the lack of function definition, the only thing we can confidently say is that `test_cases` remains greater than 0, and no changes are made to `test_cases` or any other variables because the function's behavior is unknown.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**.
