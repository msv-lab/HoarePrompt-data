The given code snippet updates the `_min_edge` variable to the minimum edge weight of the set containing `parent_u` as determined by the `dsu.min_edge` dictionary.

Output State: **`graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times; `edges` is a list of `m-1` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple; `dsu` is a DSU object with updated internal state reflecting the union of the sets containing `u` and `v`; `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to reflect the new parent pointers after the union; `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`; `node_u` and `node_v` are set to `u` and `v` respectively if `parent_u` was equal to `parent_v`, otherwise they remain `-1`.**

In simpler terms, the minimum edge weight for the set containing `parent_u` is now stored in `_min_edge`. Other variables remain unchanged.
