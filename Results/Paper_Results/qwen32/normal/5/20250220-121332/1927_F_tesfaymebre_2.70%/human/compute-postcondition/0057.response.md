Output State: **`graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times; `edges` is an empty list, as all edges have been processed; `dsu` is a DSU object with an internal state reflecting the union of all sets containing the nodes, indicating a single connected component; `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight found in the graph; `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes corresponding to `_min_edge`.**

In natural language: After the loop completes all iterations, the `graph` remains unchanged with its recorded connections. The `edges` list is empty because all edges have been processed. The `dsu` object now reflects a single connected component, meaning all nodes are part of the same set. The `_min_edge` variable holds the weight of the smallest edge encountered during the process, and `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes that form this smallest edge.
