The code `dsu.union(u, v, w)` will perform a union operation on the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure, merging the sets containing `u` and `v`. This operation will update the parent pointers and possibly the rank of the sets involved. Since `parent_u` is not equal to `parent_v`, it means `u` and `v` are in different sets, and the union operation will connect them.

The variables `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` are not affected by the `dsu.union` operation. The value of `_min_edge` remains `float('inf')`, and `node_u` and `node_v` remain `-1`.

The values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` will change after the union operation, as they will now point to the same root of the merged set. However, the exact values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` after the union operation depend on the internal implementation of the DSU, specifically how it determines the new parent (usually based on rank or size).

Output State: **`graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times, `edges` is a list of `m` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements where the sets containing `u` and `v` are now merged, `_min_edge` is `float('inf')`, `node_u` is `-1`, `node_v` is `-1`, `parent_u` is the new parent of the merged set, `parent_v` is the new parent of the merged set**.
