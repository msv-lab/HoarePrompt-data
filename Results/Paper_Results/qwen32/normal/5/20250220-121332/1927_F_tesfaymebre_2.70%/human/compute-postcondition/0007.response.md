To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior based on the provided information. The loop runs `test_cases` number of times, and the function `func_6()` is called in each iteration.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that:
- After the first iteration, `test_cases` must have been greater than 0.
- After the second iteration, `test_cases` must have been greater than 1.
- After the third iteration, `test_cases` must have been greater than 2.

To generalize, the loop will execute until `test_cases` iterations have been completed. After the loop finishes, `test_cases` will still hold the initial value it had before the loop started because the loop does not modify `test_cases` within its body.

Since `func_6()` is called `test_cases` times, the only change is in the number of times `func_6()` has been executed. However, the state of `test_cases` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `test_cases` retains its initial value, and `func_6()` has been called `test_cases` number of times.

Output State: **`test_cases` retains its initial value, and `func_6()` has been called `test_cases` number of times.**

In simple terms, the value of `test_cases` remains the same as it was before the loop started, and `func_6()` has been executed as many times as the initial value of `test_cases`.
