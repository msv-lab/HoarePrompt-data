Postcondition: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, `colors[curr]` is 1, `graph[curr]` is a list with at least one element, `nei` is the next neighbor in `graph[curr]` (specifically, the element after the current `nei`). If `res` is not empty and `node_v` is in the set `set_res`, the program returns the result of the recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`, which is stored in the variable `res`. Otherwise, no return value is specified for the else part.**
