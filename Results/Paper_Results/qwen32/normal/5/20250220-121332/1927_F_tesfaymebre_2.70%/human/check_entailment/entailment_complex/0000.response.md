### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_1`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` using `func_3`.
   - It then reads the edges and their weights using `func_3` again, storing them in a list `edges` and a graph adjacency list `graph`.

2. **Processing Edges:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights.
   - A Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure is initialized with `n + 1` sets (to accommodate 1-based indexing).
   - The program iterates through the edges, attempting to union the sets of the vertices connected by each edge.
   - If two vertices are already in the same set, it means adding this edge would form a cycle. The program keeps track of the minimum-weight edge in such cycles.

3. **Finding the Cycle:**
   - Once the minimum-weight edge in a cycle is identified, the program performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the vertices of this edge.
   - The DFS is designed to detect the cycle and return the sequence of vertices forming the cycle.
   - The DFS uses a `colors` array to keep track of visited vertices and avoids revisiting the parent vertex to prevent cycles within the DFS itself.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the weight of the minimum-weight edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the sequence of vertices forming the cycle.

### Issues Identified:
- **Edge Sorting:** The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights. However, to find the cycle with the minimum-weight edge, the edges should be processed in ascending order of their weights. The current implementation will likely not find the correct cycle because it starts with the heaviest edges first.
- **DFS Implementation:** The DFS implementation assumes that the cycle will be found starting from `node_u`. However, there is no guarantee that `node_u` is part of the cycle with the minimum-weight edge. The DFS should be started from any vertex that is part of the cycle with the minimum-weight edge.
- **Graph and DSU Scope:** The `graph` variable is used in the `dfs` function, but it is not passed as an argument. This works because `graph` is a global variable. However, this is not a good practice and can lead to issues in larger programs.
- **Cycle Detection:** The DFS implementation does not correctly detect cycles. It should detect cycles by keeping track of the path and checking if the current vertex has been visited before.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct as it does not guarantee finding the cycle with the minimum-weight edge. The sorting of edges in descending order and the DFS implementation are flawed.

**Correctness: False**
