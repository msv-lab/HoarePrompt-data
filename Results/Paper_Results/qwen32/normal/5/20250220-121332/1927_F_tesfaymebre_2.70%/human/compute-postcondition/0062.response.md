Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `m`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in a graph and `m` is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph, with the constraints 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5). The function returns a graph based on these parameters.**
