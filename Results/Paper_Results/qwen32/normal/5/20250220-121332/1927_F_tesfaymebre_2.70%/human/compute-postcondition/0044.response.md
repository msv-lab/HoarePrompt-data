Postcondition: **`graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times; `edges` is a list of `m-1` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple; `dsu` is a DSU object with updated internal state reflecting the union of the sets containing `u` and `v`; `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to reflect the new parent pointers after the union; `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`; `node_u` is `u` if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, otherwise `node_u` remains `-1`; `node_v` is `v` if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, otherwise `node_v` remains `-1`.**
