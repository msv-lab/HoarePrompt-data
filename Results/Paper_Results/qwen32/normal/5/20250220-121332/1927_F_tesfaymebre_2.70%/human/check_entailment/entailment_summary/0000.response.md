### Reasoning:

1. **Graph Construction and Edge Sorting**:
   - The graph is constructed using an adjacency list representation.
   - A list of edges is created, which is then sorted in descending order based on edge weights. This reverse sorting is crucial for the subsequent union-find operations.

2. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) Operations**:
   - The `DSU` class is used to manage connected components of the graph.
   - The `union` method is used to connect vertices and keep track of the minimum edge weight in each connected component.
   - The `find` method is used to determine the root of a given vertex, with path compression to optimize future queries.

3. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The main logic in `func_6` iterates through the sorted edges. When two vertices are found to be in the same connected component, it indicates a cycle.
   - The edge forming the cycle is noted, and the minimum edge weight in the cycle is tracked.
   - The union operation is performed to merge the components, and the minimum edge weight is updated accordingly.

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS) for Finding the Cycle**:
   - Once a cycle is detected, a DFS is initiated from one of the vertices involved in the cycle to find the complete cycle path.
   - The DFS function (`dfs`) tracks visited nodes using a color array and backtracks to find the cycle path that includes the other vertex involved in the cycle.

5. **Output**:
   - After identifying the cycle, the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle are printed.
   - The vertices of the cycle are printed in the order they were traversed.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function references `graph`, `node_v`, and `colors` which are not defined within the scope of the function. These variables should be passed as arguments to the function.
- **Cycle Detection**: The code currently uses a union-find approach to detect cycles but does not ensure that the cycle found is the one with the minimal lightest edge weight. The union-find operations should be adjusted to ensure that the cycle found is the desired one.
- **Edge Sorting**: The edges are sorted in descending order, which might not be appropriate for finding the cycle with the minimal lightest edge. The edges should be sorted in ascending order to ensure that the lightest edges are considered first.

### Correctness:
Given the described issues, the program as provided is **not** correct. The DFS function has scoping issues, and the union-find operations may not correctly identify the cycle with the minimal lightest edge weight.

### Correctness: **False**
