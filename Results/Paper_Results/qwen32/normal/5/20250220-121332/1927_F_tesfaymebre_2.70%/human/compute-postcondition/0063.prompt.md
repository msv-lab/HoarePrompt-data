You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and m is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5).
def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: `graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times, and `edges` is a list of `m` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    node_u = -1
    node_v = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
            if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
                node_u = u
                node_v = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
        
    #State: `graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times; `edges` is an empty list, as all edges have been processed; `dsu` is a DSU object with an internal state reflecting the union of all sets containing the nodes, indicating a single connected component; `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight found in the graph; `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes corresponding to `_min_edge`.
    colors = [0] * (n + 1)
    res = dfs(node_u, -1, [])
    print(_min_edge, len(res))
    #This is printed: _min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the minimum edge weight in the graph and len(res) is the number of nodes in the list `res`)
    print(*res)
    #This is printed: node_u, node_v, ... (where node_u is the starting node and the sequence includes all nodes in the graph)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n` and `m`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in a graph and `m` is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph, with the constraints 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5). The function returns a graph based on these parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
