Postcondition: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, `colors[curr]` is 1, `graph[curr]` is a list with at least one element, `nei` is the next neighbor in `graph[curr]`. If `colors[nei] != 2` and `nei != parent`, `res` is the result of `dfs(nei, curr, path)`, `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`. If `res` is not empty and `node_v` is in `set_res`, the program returns `res`. Otherwise, the program does not return and continues with the next statements. If `colors[nei] == 2` or `nei == parent`, the program does not execute the if block and continues with the next statements.**
