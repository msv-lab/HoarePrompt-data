The code snippet provided is:
```
node_v = v
```

This line of code assigns the value of `v` to the variable `node_v`. Given the initial state, the only change is the value of `node_v` being updated to `v`.

Output State: **`graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times; `edges` is a list of `m-1` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple; `dsu` is a DSU object with updated internal state reflecting the union of the sets containing `u` and `v`; `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to reflect the new parent pointers after the union; `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`; `node_u` is `u`; `node_v` is `v`.**

In natural language, this means that after executing the code, `node_v` is set to the value of `v`, while all other variables retain their initial values and states as described.
