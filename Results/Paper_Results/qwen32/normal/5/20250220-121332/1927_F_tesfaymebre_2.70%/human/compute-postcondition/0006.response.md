To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the function `func_6()` on the variables and the initial conditions provided. However, the code snippet `func_6()` does not specify what operations this function performs or which variables it modifies. Since there is no information about the function's behavior, we cannot determine any changes to the variables or the state of the program.

Given the initial state and the lack of specific operations in the provided code snippet, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**.
