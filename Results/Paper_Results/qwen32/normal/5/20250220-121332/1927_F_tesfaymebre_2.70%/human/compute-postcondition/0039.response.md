Output State: **`graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times, `edges` is a list of `m-1` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements, `parent_u` is updated to `dsu.find(u)`, `parent_v` is updated to `dsu.find(v)`, `_min_edge` remains `float('inf')` if `parent_u` is not equal to `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` if `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v` and `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, `node_u` and `node_v` are set to `u` and `v` respectively if `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, otherwise `node_u` and `node_v` remain `-1`.**

In simple terms, the variable `parent_v` is updated to the root parent of `v` as found by the DSU object. The other variables remain unchanged unless `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, in which case `_min_edge` and `node_u`, `node_v` might be updated accordingly.
