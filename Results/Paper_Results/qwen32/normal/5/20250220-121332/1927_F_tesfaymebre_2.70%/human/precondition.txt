n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that for each test case, 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n - 1)/2, 2 * 10^5). m is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph. The graph is described by a list of edges where each edge is a tuple (u, v, w) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. There is at most one edge between any pair of vertices, and the graph does not contain loops. The sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
