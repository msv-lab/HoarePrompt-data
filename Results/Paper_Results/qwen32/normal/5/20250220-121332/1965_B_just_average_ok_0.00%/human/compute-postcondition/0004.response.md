The `while` loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`. To ensure that the loop executes at least once, the condition must be true right before the loop starts. Given the initial state where `idx` is 0, the condition simplifies to `k >= 1 << 0`, which is `k >= 1`.

Here are the variables in the loop head that can be adjusted: `k` and `idx`.

- `idx` is initially 0, so we do not need to change it.
- `k` must be an integer such that `k >= 1`.

The initial state provided does not specify any constraints on `k` other than it being the second integer from the input. To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure `k` is at least 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1; `nums` is a list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`; `idx` is 0**
