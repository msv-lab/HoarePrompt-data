To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the conditions under which it terminates.

The loop increments `idx` as long as `k` is greater than or equal to `1 << idx` (which is equivalent to `2^idx`). The loop stops when `k` is less than `1 << idx`.

From the provided output states:
- After 1 iteration: `idx` is 1, so `k` must be at least 2.
- After 2 iterations: `idx` is 2, so `k` must be at least 4.
- After 3 iterations: `idx` is still 2, so `k` must be less than 8 but at least 4.

This implies that `k` is a value between 4 and 7 (inclusive) for the loop to execute exactly 3 times and terminate.

To find the final state, we need to determine the maximum value of `idx` such that `k` is still greater than or equal to `1 << idx`. The list `nums` provided contains powers of 2 up to `2^23` (8388608). The loop will terminate when `k` is less than the next power of 2 in the list.

If `k` is a value between 4 and 7, the loop will terminate when `idx` reaches 3 because `1 << 3` is 8, and `k` is less than 8.

Thus, the final value of `idx` will be 3 if `k` is between 4 and 7. If `k` is greater than 7, `idx` will continue to increment until `k` is less than the next power of 2.

Given that the output state after 3 iterations has `idx` as 2 and `k` must be less than 8 but at least 4, we can conclude that the loop will terminate at `idx` = 3.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is a list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`; `idx` is 3.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `idx` will be 3, and `k` will be a value between 4 and 7.
