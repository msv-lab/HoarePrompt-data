The code snippet appends a new value to the list `nums`. Specifically, it appends the result of `k - nums[idx]` to `nums`. Given the initial state, `idx` is 2, so `nums[idx]` is `nums[2]`, which is 4. Therefore, the value appended to `nums` is `k - 4`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k - 4`]; `idx` is 2.**

In simpler terms, the list `nums` now includes an additional element at the end, which is the result of subtracting 4 from `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
