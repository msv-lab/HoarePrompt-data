You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
        
        idx = 0
        
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        
        idx -= 1
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: The length of `nums` is 24 + 2t, and `nums` contains the initial powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) with modifications based on the values of `k` for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program attempts to generate a sequence `a` that meets the conditions specified in the problem description. However, there are several issues and edge cases that the program does not handle correctly:

1. **Handling of Powers of 2**: The program generates a sequence using powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\). This is a good start because powers of 2 can form any sum up to \(2^{24} - 1\) by combining different subsets. However, the program does not ensure that the sequence does not allow a subsequence to sum to \(k\), and it does not ensure that all sums up to \(n\) (except \(k\)) are possible.

2. **Adjusting the Sequence Based on \(k\)**: The program tries to adjust the sequence by removing a power of 2 and adding specific values around \(k\). This adjustment is intended to prevent a subsequence from summing to \(k\), but it does not guarantee that all other sums up to \(n\) (except \(k\)) are possible.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases effectively. For example, when \(k\) is very small or very large, the adjustments made might not work as intended. Specifically, if \(k\) is a power of 2 or close to a power of 2, the adjustments might not prevent a subsequence from summing to \(k\).

4. **General Correctness**: The program does not provide a general proof or method to ensure that all sums up to \(n\) (except \(k\)) are possible while preventing any subsequence from summing to \(k\). This is a complex problem that requires a more rigorous approach to generate the sequence.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
10 7
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
1 2 8 3
```

The provided program might generate a sequence that does not meet the requirements for this test case or any other edge cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To fix the program, a more systematic approach to generating the sequence is required, ensuring that all sums up to \(n\) (except \(k\)) are possible while preventing any subsequence from summing to \(k\).
