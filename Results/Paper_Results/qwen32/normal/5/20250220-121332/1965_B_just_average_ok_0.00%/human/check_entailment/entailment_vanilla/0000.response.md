Let's analyze the given program step-by-step in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: 
   - Find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - Ensure there is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
   - Ensure for all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

2. **Constraints**:
   - `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`
   - `1 ≤ k ≤ n`
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `10^7`.
   - The sequence `a` should be of size at most 25.

### Program Analysis:
The program generates a sequence `nums` using powers of 2 up to `2^23` (which is `8388608`). The key steps are:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `nums` is initialized with the first 24 powers of 2 (`[1, 2, 4, ..., 8388608]`).
2. **Adjusting for `k`**:
   - It finds the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - It then replaces that power of 2 with `k - (that power of 2)`.
   - It adds `k + 1` and `k + (that power of 2) + 1` to the sequence.
   - It removes the power of 2 that was replaced.

### Verification:
1. **Subsequence Sum `k`**:
   - The replacement and addition of `k + 1` and `k + (that power of 2) + 1` ensure that no subsequence of `nums` can sum to `k`. This is because the exact value `k` is not directly represented, and the additions ensure that any combination that could sum to `k` is disrupted.
   
2. **Subsequence Sum `v` for `1 ≤ v ≤ n` and `v ≠ k`**:
   - The sequence `nums` initially contains the first 24 powers of 2, which can represent any sum up to `2^24 - 1` (which is much larger than `10^6`). By replacing one of these powers of 2 with `k - (that power of 2)` and adding `k + 1` and `k + (that power of 2) + 1`, the sequence can still represent all sums up to `n` except `k`. This is because the set of powers of 2 is dense enough to cover all possible sums, and the adjustments made do not disrupt the ability to form all sums except `k`.

3. **Sequence Size**:
   - The sequence `nums` is initially of size 24. After the modifications, it remains of size at most 25, satisfying the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence `nums` that meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
