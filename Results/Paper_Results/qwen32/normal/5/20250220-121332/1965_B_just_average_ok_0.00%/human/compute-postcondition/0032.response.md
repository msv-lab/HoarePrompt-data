The code appends a new value to the list `nums`. The new value is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Given that `idx` is 1, the new value becomes `k + nums[1] + 1`. Since `nums[1]` is 2, the new value is `k + 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `k + 3`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `idx` remain unchanged. The list `nums` is updated to include the new value at the end.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is a list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 2, k + 1, k + 3]`; `idx` is 1.**
