The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. This means that the initial values of `n` and `k` are overwritten with the new values read from the input. The values of `t` and `idx` remain unchanged, and the list `nums` is also not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is a list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 4, k + 1, k + 5]`; `idx` is 2**.
