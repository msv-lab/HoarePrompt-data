To determine the output of the `print(*nums)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the definition of the `nums` list.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), but `t` is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `n` is the first integer from the input, but it is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `k` is the second integer from the input and must satisfy \(4 \leq k < 8\).
- `nums` is a predefined list that includes specific powers of 2 and values derived from `k`: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 4, k + 1, k + 5]`.
- `idx` is set to 2, but it is not used in the provided code snippet.

### Determining the `nums` List:
Given the range of `k` (\(4 \leq k < 8\)), we can enumerate the possible values for `k` and determine the corresponding `nums` list.

#### Case 1: \(k = 4\)
- `nums` = `[1, 2, 4, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 0, 5, 9]`

#### Case 2: \(k = 5\)
- `nums` = `[1, 2, 4, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 1, 6, 10]`

#### Case 3: \(k = 6\)
- `nums` = `[1, 2, 4, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 2, 7, 11]`

#### Case 4: \(k = 7\)
- `nums` = `[1, 2, 4, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 3, 8, 12]`

### Conclusion:
The `print(*nums)` statement will output the elements of the `nums` list, which depends on the value of `k` within the range \(4 \leq k < 8\). Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we need to describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **1, 2, 4, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 4, k + 1, k + 5 (where k is an integer such that 4 â‰¤ k < 8)**
