Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the area of a square given its four corners in a coordinate plane. The sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, and the area can be determined by finding the length of one side and squaring it.

### Key Observations
1. For a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the x-coordinates of two opposite corners will be the same, and the y-coordinates of the other two opposite corners will be the same.
2. The side length of the square can be determined by the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of two points with the same x-coordinate (or between the x-coordinates of two points with the same y-coordinate).

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads the coordinates of the four corners. It then checks the conditions to find two points with the same x-coordinate or y-coordinate and calculates the side length of the square based on the absolute difference in the other coordinate. Finally, it prints the area of the square by squaring the side length.

### Correctness Check
Let's check if the program correctly handles different scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1**: The first example input in the problem statement:
   ```
   3
   1 2
   4 5
   1 5
   4 2
   ```
   - The points (1, 2) and (1, 5) have the same x-coordinate, and the difference in y-coordinates is 3. Thus, the side length is 3, and the area is \(3^2 = 9\).
   - The points (4, 5) and (4, 2) also have the same x-coordinate, and the difference in y-coordinates is 3. Thus, the side length is 3, and the area is \(3^2 = 9\).
   - The points (1, 2) and (4, 2) have the same y-coordinate, and the difference in x-coordinates is 3. Thus, the side length is 3, and the area is \(3^2 = 9\).
   - The points (1, 5) and (4, 5) also have the same y-coordinate, and the difference in x-coordinates is 3. Thus, the side length is 3, and the area is \(3^2 = 9\).
   - The program correctly outputs `9` for this test case.

2. **Scenario 2**: The second example input in the problem statement:
   ```
   -1 1
   1 -1
   1 1
   -1 -1
   ```
   - The points (-1, 1) and (-1, -1) have the same x-coordinate, and the difference in y-coordinates is 2. Thus, the side length is 2, and the area is \(2^2 = 4\).
   - The points (1, -1) and (1, 1) also have the same x-coordinate, and the difference in y-coordinates is 2. Thus, the side length is 2, and the area is \(2^2 = 4\).
   - The points (-1, 1) and (1, 1) have the same y-coordinate, and the difference in x-coordinates is 2. Thus, the side length is 2, and the area is \(2^2 = 4\).
   - The points (-1, -1) and (1, -1) also have the same y-coordinate, and the difference in x-coordinates is 2. Thus, the side length is 2, and the area is \(2^2 = 4\).
   - The program correctly outputs `4` for this test case.

3. **Scenario 3**: The third example input in the problem statement:
   ```
   45 11
   45 39
   17 11
   17 39
   ```
   - The points (45, 11) and (45, 39) have the same x-coordinate, and the difference in y-coordinates is 28. Thus, the side length is 28, and the area is \(28^2 = 784\).
   - The points (17, 11) and (17, 39) also have the same x-coordinate, and the difference in y-coordinates is 28. Thus, the side length is 28, and the area is \(28^2 = 784\).
   - The points (45, 11) and (17, 11) have the same y-coordinate, and the difference in x-coordinates is 28. Thus, the side length is 28, and the area is \(28^2 = 784\).
   - The points (45, 39) and (17, 39) also have the same y-coordinate, and the difference in x-coordinates is 28. Thus, the side length is 28, and the area is \(28^2 = 784\).
   - The program correctly outputs `784` for this test case.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the given scenarios and calculates the area of the square based on the coordinates of its corners. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
