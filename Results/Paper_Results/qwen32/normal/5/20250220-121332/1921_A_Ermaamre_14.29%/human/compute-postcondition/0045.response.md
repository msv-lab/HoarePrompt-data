Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, and `y4` are integers read from the input, `x4` and `y4` represent the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, `a` is greater than the current value of `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`, or if `x1` equals `x4` and `x3` equals `x2`, then `res` is set to the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. Otherwise, the values of `res` and `i` remain unchanged.**
