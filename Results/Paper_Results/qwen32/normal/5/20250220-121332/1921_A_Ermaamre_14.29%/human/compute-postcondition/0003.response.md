Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, there are four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, `a` must be greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are integers representing the coordinates input by the user, `x2` and `y2` are integers representing the coordinates input by the user.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the corners of the square remain unchanged. The variable `a` is still greater than 0. The coordinates `x1` and `y1` remain as they were input by the user. Additionally, `x2` and `y2` are now assigned the integer values input by the user.
