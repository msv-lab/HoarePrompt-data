The value of `res` is updated to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `x1` and `y1` are integers read from the input, `x2` and `y2` are integers read from the input, `x3` and `y3` are integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is greater than `i + 1`, `res` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, and `x4` and `y4` are integers read from the input.**
