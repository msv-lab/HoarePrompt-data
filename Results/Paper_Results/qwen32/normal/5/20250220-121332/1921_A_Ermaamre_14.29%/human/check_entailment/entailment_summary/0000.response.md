### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The key steps in the program are:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square.
2. **Determining Side Length**: The program checks the x-coordinates of the corners to determine which pairs of corners are aligned vertically (i.e., have the same x-coordinate). Based on this, it calculates the side length of the square by taking the absolute difference of the y-coordinates of the vertically aligned corners.
3. **Calculating Area**: Once the side length is determined, the program calculates the area of the square by squaring the side length.
4. **Output**: The program prints the area of the square for each test case.

Let's verify the correctness of the program using the provided example:

#### Example Verification:

**Test Case 1:**
- Coordinates: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
- Vertically aligned pairs: (1, 2) and (1, 5), (4, 5) and (4, 2)
- Side length: abs(5 - 2) = 3
- Area: 3^2 = 9

**Test Case 2:**
- Coordinates: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
- Vertically aligned pairs: (-1, 1) and (-1, -1), (1, -1) and (1, 1)
- Side length: abs(1 - (-1)) = 2
- Area: 2^2 = 4

**Test Case 3:**
- Coordinates: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
- Vertically aligned pairs: (45, 11) and (45, 39), (17, 11) and (17, 39)
- Side length: abs(39 - 11) = 28
- Area: 28^2 = 784

The program correctly calculates the area for each of the test cases provided in the example.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the area of a square given its corner coordinates and handles the example cases as expected.

**Correctness: True**
