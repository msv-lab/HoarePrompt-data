Let's break down the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Input:** 
   - The first line contains an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, four lines follow, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of a corner of a square.
   - The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the area of the square.

3. **Key Points:**
   - The square is aligned with the axes, meaning the sides are either horizontal or vertical.
   - The area of the square can be determined by calculating the distance between two adjacent corners (either horizontally or vertically) and then squaring this distance.

### Program Analysis:

The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square.

The program then checks the x-coordinates of the points to determine which points are aligned horizontally and which are aligned vertically. It calculates the side length of the square by finding the absolute difference in the y-coordinates of two points that share the same x-coordinate or the absolute difference in the x-coordinates of two points that share the same y-coordinate.

Finally, it squares the calculated side length to get the area of the square and prints it.

### Correctness:

The logic in the program is correct based on the problem description. The program correctly identifies which points are aligned horizontally and vertically, calculates the side length of the square, and then computes the area. The program handles all possible configurations of the square's corners correctly.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic using the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Points: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
   - The program identifies that (1, 2) and (1, 5) are aligned vertically, and (4, 5) and (4, 2) are aligned vertically.
   - It calculates the side length as `abs(5 - 2) = 3`.
   - The area is `3 ** 2 = 9`.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Points: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
   - The program identifies that (-1, 1) and (1, 1) are aligned horizontally, and (-1, -1) and (1, -1) are aligned horizontally.
   - It calculates the side length as `abs(1 - (-1)) = 2`.
   - The area is `2 ** 2 = 4`.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Points: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
   - The program identifies that (45, 11) and (45, 39) are aligned vertically, and (17, 11) and (17, 39) are aligned vertically.
   - It calculates the side length as `abs(39 - 11) = 28`.
   - The area is `28 ** 2 = 784`.

Since the program correctly computes the area for the provided examples and follows the correct logic, we can conclude that the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
