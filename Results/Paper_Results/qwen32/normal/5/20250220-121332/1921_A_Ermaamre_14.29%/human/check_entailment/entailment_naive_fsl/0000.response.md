Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to determine the side length of the square by checking specific conditions on the x-coordinates of the points. However, this approach is not robust and can fail for certain configurations of the square's corners.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
0 0
1 1
1 0
0 1
```
In this case, the square has a side length of 1, and thus the area should be 1. However, the provided program will not correctly compute the side length because it only checks specific pairs of x-coordinates and assumes the other coordinates will match accordingly. For this input, the program will not correctly identify the side length and will likely produce an incorrect result.

The program should instead compute the differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points to determine the side length of the square. A more robust solution would involve sorting the points or using a different approach to ensure the correct side length is calculated regardless of the order of the points.
