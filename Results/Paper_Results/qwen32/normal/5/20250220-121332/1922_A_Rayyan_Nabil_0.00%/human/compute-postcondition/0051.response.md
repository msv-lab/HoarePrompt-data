To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the entire range of the loop from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. The loop checks if there exists at least one index `i` such that both `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`. If such an index is found, `l` is set to 'YES'. If no such index is found after checking all indices, `l` remains 'NO'.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
        l = 'YES'
else:
    l = 'NO'
```
The `else` block of the `for` loop is executed only if the loop completes all iterations without breaking. This means that if `l` is not set to 'YES' during any iteration, it will be set to 'NO' after the loop completes.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `l` will be 'YES' if at least one index `i` (0 <= i < n) satisfies `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`.
- `l` will be 'NO' if no such index exists after checking all indices.

Since the `else` block sets `l` to 'NO' if the loop completes without setting `l` to 'YES', the final state of `l` is determined by whether any index satisfies the condition during the loop's execution.

Output State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` (0 <= i < n) such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` is 'NO'.**

In natural language, the final output state is that `l` will be 'YES' if there is at least one position in the lists `a` and `b` where both elements differ from the corresponding element in `c`. If no such position exists, `l` will be 'NO'.
