The code snippet assigns the string `'YES'` to the variable `l`. The values of `i` and `n` are not affected by this assignment. The precondition that `i` is incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i` remains valid.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`, `l` is `'YES'`**
