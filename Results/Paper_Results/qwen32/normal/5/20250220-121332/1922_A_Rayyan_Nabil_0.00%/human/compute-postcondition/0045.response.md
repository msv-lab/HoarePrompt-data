The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` (0 <= i < n) such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` remains 'NO'.
- `t` is unchanged.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are the user's inputs.
- At the current index `i`, if `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, `l` is set to 'YES'.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has a certain value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, provided that `i` is still less than `n`.

State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` (0 <= i < n) such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` remains 'NO', `t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the user's inputs, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since `i` is the only variable that can be adjusted in the loop head, we increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration:
State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` (0 <= i < n) such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` remains 'NO', `t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the user's inputs, `i` is `i + 1`**.

To be more precise:
State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` (0 <= i < n) such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` remains 'NO', `t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the user's inputs, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**.
