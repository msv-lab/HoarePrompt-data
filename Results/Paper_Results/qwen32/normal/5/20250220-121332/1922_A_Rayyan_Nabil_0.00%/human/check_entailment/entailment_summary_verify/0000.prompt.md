You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of equal length `n`. For each test case, it determines if every character in string `c` matches at least one of the corresponding characters in strings `a` or `b`. It prints 'YES' if this condition is met for all characters in `c`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

The main issue with the code is in the logic used to determine if a valid template exists. The loop iterates through each character of the strings a, b, and c, and checks if the characters in a and b are different from the corresponding character in c. However, the code does not correctly handle the conditions for a template:

1. If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i.
2. If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i.

The current code simply checks if the characters in a and b are different from c, which is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists. It does not ensure that there is a consistent template that can be applied to all characters.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Input:
```
1
2
aa
bb
ab
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Explanation:
- For the first character, 'a' in a and 'b' in b are different from 'a' in c, so they could potentially match a template.
- For the second character, 'a' in a and 'b' in b are different from 'b' in c, so they could potentially match a template.
- However, there is no single template that can be applied to both characters:
  - If the template is 'A', then 'a' and 'b' match, but 'b' does not match.
  - If the template is 'B', then 'a' and 'b' match, but 'a' does not match.
  - If the template is 'a', then 'a' and 'a' match, but 'b' does not match.
  - If the template is 'b', then 'b' and 'b' match, but 'a' does not match.

The code would incorrectly output "YES" for this input because it does not correctly check for the existence of a valid template.

A correct approach would involve checking each character position to see if it is possible to assign a template character that satisfies the conditions for all three strings.
