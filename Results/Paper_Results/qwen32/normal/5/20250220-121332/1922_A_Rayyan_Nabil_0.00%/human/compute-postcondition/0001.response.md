Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `l` is 'YES'**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been changed to 'YES', while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) retain their initial values and constraints.
