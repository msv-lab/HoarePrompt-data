The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `a`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and it satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`, and it satisfies the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. The list `a` contains `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. 

The function processes each test case individually and returns a result for each case. Since the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information, we can describe the functionality in a general manner based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the values in the list `a`.**
