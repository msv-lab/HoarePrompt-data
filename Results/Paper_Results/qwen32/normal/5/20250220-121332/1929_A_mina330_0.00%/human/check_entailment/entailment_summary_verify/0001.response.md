### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array `a`, defined as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. To maximize this beauty, we need to rearrange the elements of the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

#### Key Insight:
The optimal approach to maximize the beauty is to sort the array and then alternate between the smallest and largest remaining elements. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are as large as possible.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements up to the middle of the array. Specifically, it computes:
\[ \text{kq} = \sum_{i=0}^{n/2-1} (a[n-i-1] - a[i]) \]

Let's verify if this approach is correct by comparing it with the optimal approach.

#### Optimal Approach:
1. Sort the array.
2. Initialize two pointers: one at the start (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the array.
3. Calculate the beauty by summing the differences between the elements pointed by `right` and `left` while moving the pointers towards each other:
\[ \text{beauty} = \sum_{i=0}^{n/2-1} (a[n-i-1] - a[i]) \]

#### Comparison:
The provided solution and the optimal approach are actually the same. Both involve sorting the array and then summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements up to the middle of the array. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum beauty.

#### Example Revisited:
For the input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`:
1. Sort the array: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
2. Calculate the beauty:
   - `(100 - 43) + (90 - 54) + (80 - 80) = 57`

The provided solution correctly computes this as:
\[ \text{kq} = (100 - 43) + (90 - 54) = 57 \]

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution is indeed correct as it implements the optimal approach to maximize the beauty of the array.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
