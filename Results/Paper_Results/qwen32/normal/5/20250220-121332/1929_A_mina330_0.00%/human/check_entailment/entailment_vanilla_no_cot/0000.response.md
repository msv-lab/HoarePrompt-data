Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n. To maximize this sum, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones. This can be achieved by arranging the array in such a way that the largest elements are placed at odd indices and the smallest elements are placed at even indices.

### Program Analysis:
The given program sorts the array and then computes the beauty by summing up the differences between the largest and smallest elements in a specific manner. However, the approach taken by the program does not guarantee the maximum beauty of the array.

The program sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements in a loop that runs only half the length of the array. This approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array such that the largest elements are placed at odd indices and the smallest elements are placed at even indices. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then alternating between the largest and smallest elements.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a correct implementation based on the above approach:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        # Arrange the array in the order of smallest, largest, second smallest, second largest, etc.
        left, right = 0, n - 1
        while left < right:
            kq += a[right] - a[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        print(kq)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
