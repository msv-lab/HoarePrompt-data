To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `sub_summ` variable. The loop iterates over each tuple in `sec_arr` and adds the first element of each tuple to `sub_summ`.

Given the initial state where `sub_summ` is 0, and after each iteration, `sub_summ` is incremented by the first element of the current tuple in `sec_arr`, we can conclude that after all iterations, `sub_summ` will be the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`.

Let's denote the first elements of the tuples in `sec_arr` as `sec_arr[0][0]`, `sec_arr[1][0]`, ..., `sec_arr[n-1][0]`, where `n` is the number of tuples in `sec_arr`. After all iterations, `sub_summ` will be:

\[ sub\_summ = sec\_arr[0][0] + sec\_arr[1][0] + \ldots + sec\_arr[n-1][0] \]

The state of `main_ar` remains unchanged throughout the loop, and `sec_arr` remains the same as well, as the loop only reads from `sec_arr` and does not modify it.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`.**

In simpler terms, `sub_summ` will hold the total sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`, while `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged.
