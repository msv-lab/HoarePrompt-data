### Reasoning:

The given Python program aims to solve the problem by considering the optimal choices for both Alice and Bob. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads the number of items `n` and the number of items Bob can take for free `k`.
   - It then reads the prices for Alice `a` and the prices for Bob `b`.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - The program constructs a list `arr` where each element is a tuple `[a[i], b[i]]` representing the prices of the i-th item for Alice and Bob.
   - This list is sorted based on the price for Bob `b[i]` in ascending order. The idea is to prioritize items that Bob values less, as Alice might want to sell these items to Bob to maximize her profit.

3. **Initial Selection:**
   - The program uses a heap `k_arr` to keep track of the `k` items that Bob will take for free. It pushes the `k` items with the highest prices for Alice into the heap (since `a` is negated, the highest prices for Alice become the smallest in the heap).

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The initial profit (`sub_sum`) is calculated by summing the prices for Alice in `k_arr` and adding the profit from selling items in the remaining list `arr` where the sum of prices for Alice and Bob is non-negative.
   - The program then iteratively updates the profit by considering different subsets of items Alice could buy and sell, adjusting the heap `k_arr` to reflect Bob's optimal choice of items to take for free.

5. **Maximizing Profit:**
   - The program keeps track of the maximum profit encountered during the iterations and prints it for each test case.

### Analysis of Functions:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):** Correctly reads the number of test cases.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`):** Correctly reads and parses the input for `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.
- **Function 3 (`func_3`):** Correctly calculates the initial profit by summing the prices for Alice in `sec_arr` and adding the profit from selling items in `main_ar` where the sum of prices for Alice and Bob is non-negative.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic and the functions' implementations align with the problem description. The program correctly handles the input, calculates the profit by considering the optimal choices for both Alice and Bob, and outputs the maximum profit for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
