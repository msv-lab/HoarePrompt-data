The only variables in the loop head are `val_a` and `sec_arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `val_a` and `sec_arr`. If there are more tuples in `sec_arr` that have not been iterated over, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, and `val_a` is the current tuple being processed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sec_arr` must have at least one more tuple after the current one, and `val_a` should be the next tuple in `sec_arr`.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `sub_summ` is `2 * val_a[0]`, `val_a` is the second tuple in `sec_arr`**
