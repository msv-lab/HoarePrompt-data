The only variable in the loop head is `val_b`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `main_ar`. If `main_ar` has at least one more tuple after `val_b`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is calculated based on the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`, otherwise `sub_summ` remains unchanged, and `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `main_ar` must still have at least one more tuple. Since `val_b` is the current tuple being processed, for the next iteration, `val_b` should be the next tuple in `main_ar`.

Therefore, `val_b` should be updated to the next tuple in `main_ar`.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`, otherwise `sub_summ` remains unchanged, and `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`**.

Since we need to specify the exact state of `val_b` for the next iteration, let's denote the next tuple in `main_ar` after the current `val_b` as `val_b_next`.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`, otherwise `sub_summ` remains unchanged, and `val_b` is `val_b_next`**.

For clarity, let's assume the current `val_b` is the first tuple in `main_ar`, so `val_b_next` would be the second tuple in `main_ar`.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`, otherwise `sub_summ` remains unchanged, and `val_b` is the second tuple in `main_ar`**.
