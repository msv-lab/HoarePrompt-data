### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and verify if it correctly solves the problem based on the given description and annotated functions.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_2` reads two integers `n` and `k`, and then reads two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - The list `a` is negated to facilitate the use of a min-heap as a max-heap.
   - The items are stored as tuples `(a[i], b[i])` in the list `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is sorted based on `b_i` in non-decreasing order. This is intended to prioritize items that Bob pays less for.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Bob will take `k` items for free, and Alice wants to maximize her profit.
   - The program seems to aim to maximize the profit by selecting items such that the net profit is maximized after Bob takes `k` items for free.

4. **Heap Usage:**
   - A min-heap (`k_arr`) is used to keep track of the `k` most expensive items Alice buys.
   - The program pushes the `k` most expensive items into the heap and calculates the initial `sub_sum` based on the remaining items.
   - The program iteratively updates the `sub_sum` by considering the impact of removing items from `arr` and adding them to `k_arr`.

5. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The function `func_3` calculates the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` (which are the `k` most expensive items Alice buys) and the sum of both elements of each tuple in `main_ar` (remaining items) where the sum of the tuple's elements is non-negative.
   - The main loop iteratively updates `sub_sum` by removing the least profitable item in `arr` and adding a new item to `k_arr`, adjusting `sub_sum` accordingly.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum profit for each test case.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Heap Initialization:**
   - The program initializes the heap `k_arr` with the `k` most expensive items in `arr`, but it does not correctly handle the case where `k` is 0.
   - The loop `for k_range in range(1, k + 1)` is incorrect because it assumes `k` is always greater than 0.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `sub_sum`:**
   - The initial calculation of `sub_sum` is incorrect. It should be the sum of `b_i` for the items Bob buys minus the sum of `a_i` for the items Alice buys.
   - The function `func_3` does not correctly reflect the profit calculation logic.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where `k` is 0. In this case, Bob can take all items for free, and Alice's profit should be calculated differently.

### Conclusion:

The logic of the program is flawed, and it does not correctly calculate Alice's profit based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
