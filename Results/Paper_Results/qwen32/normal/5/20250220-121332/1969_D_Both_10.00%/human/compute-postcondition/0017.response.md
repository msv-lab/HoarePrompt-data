Postcondition: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, and `val_b` is the second tuple in `main_ar`. If `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`, then `sub_summ` is the initial `sub_summ` plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`. Otherwise, `sub_summ` remains unchanged.**
