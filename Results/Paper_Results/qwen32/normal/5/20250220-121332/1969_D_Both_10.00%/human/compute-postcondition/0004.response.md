The code snippet `sub_summ += val_a[0]` adds the value of `val_a[0]` to the current value of `sub_summ`. Given that the initial state specifies `sub_summ` is `val_a[0]`, after the execution, `sub_summ` will be `val_a[0] + val_a[0]`, which simplifies to `2 * val_a[0]`.

Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `sub_summ` is `2 * val_a[0]`.**
