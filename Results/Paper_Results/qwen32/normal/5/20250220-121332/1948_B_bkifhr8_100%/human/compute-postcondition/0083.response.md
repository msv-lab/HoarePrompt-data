Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input with `arr[0]` updated to `nums[0]`, `i` is `m-2`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. `nums` is a list where the first part is the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`.**
