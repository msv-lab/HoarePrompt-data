Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer.**

In this output state, the value of `m` is set to the integer value provided by the input, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) retain their initial values as described.
