The code snippet takes the `i-1`th element of the list `arr`, converts it to a string, and then converts each character of that string back to an integer to form a list of digits. It then appends the `i`th element of `arr` to this list. 

Given the initial state, the value of `i` is 1. Therefore, `arr[i - 1]` refers to `arr[0]`. Let's denote `arr[0]` as `arr_0` and `arr[1]` as `arr_1`.

The list `nums` is created by converting each digit of `arr_0` to an integer and then appending `arr_1` to this list. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers formed by the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`.**
