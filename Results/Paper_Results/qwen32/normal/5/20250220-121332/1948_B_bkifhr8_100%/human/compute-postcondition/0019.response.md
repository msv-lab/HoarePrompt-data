Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input where `arr[m - 2]` is replaced by `nums[0]`, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[m - 3]` followed by `arr[m - 2]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans`.**

Explanation: The value of `arr[i - 1]` (which is `arr[m - 3]`) is updated to `nums[0]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
