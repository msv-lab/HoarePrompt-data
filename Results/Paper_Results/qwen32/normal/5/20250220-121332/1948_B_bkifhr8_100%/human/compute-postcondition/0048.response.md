The code snippet `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` assigns the value of `nums[0]` to the element at index `i - 1` in the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `arr[i - 1]` refers to `arr[1]`. Therefore, `arr[1]` is updated to `nums[0]`.

The other variables remain unchanged unless specified otherwise. Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input with `arr[1]` updated to `nums[0]`, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[1]` and the last element is `arr[2]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `nums` is sorted, no changes are made to `ans` or the loop.**
