Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only checks if splitting the current element and the next element can form a sorted sequence, but it does not consider more complex scenarios where multiple splits might be necessary to achieve a sorted array.

Let's consider a specific test case:

**Input:**
```
1
4
12 10 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- We can split the first element `12` into `1` and `2`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 10, 3, 4]`.
- Then, we can split the second element `10` into `1` and `0`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 4]`.
- Finally, we can rearrange the array to `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is sorted.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
NO
```

**Why the Program Fails:**
- The program only checks if splitting the current element and the next element can form a sorted sequence. It does not consider the possibility of multiple splits and rearrangements.
- In the given test case, the program checks if `[1, 2]` (from splitting `12`) and `10` can form a sorted sequence, which they cannot. It then checks if `[1, 0]` (from splitting `10`) and `3` can form a sorted sequence, which they cannot. However, the correct approach would involve multiple splits and rearrangements as shown in the expected output.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case and potentially other similar cases.
