Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list created by converting the integer `arr[m - 4]` to its digits and appending `arr[m - 3]` to this list, `ans` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of all the variables remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
