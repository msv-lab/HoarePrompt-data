Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0]` is the first digit of the original `arr[0]` and the rest of the elements remain the same, `i` is 1. If `arr[i]` < `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list of integers formed by the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition.**
