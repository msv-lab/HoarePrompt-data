Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make the array sorted in non-descending order using the allowed operations. The logic in the program is flawed as it only checks a limited condition and does not fully account for the transformation possibilities.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Condition Checking**: The program checks if splitting the element at index `i-1` and adding the element at index `i` results in a sorted sequence. However, this is not sufficient to ensure that the entire array can be sorted. The program does not consider the possibility of further splits or the impact of splits on other elements.

2. **Greedy Approach**: The program uses a greedy approach by checking only the immediate elements, but the problem requires a more comprehensive approach to ensure that all elements can be properly ordered.

3. **Handling of Multiple Splits**: The program does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed to achieve a sorted array. It only considers splitting the element at `i-1` and adding the element at `i`, but there could be scenarios where multiple elements need to be split and rearranged.

4. **Incorrect Update of Array**: The program updates the array with the first digit of the split number but does not correctly handle the rest of the digits, which could affect subsequent checks.

To correctly solve this problem, a more thorough approach is needed, such as recursively splitting numbers and checking if the array can be sorted after all possible splits. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    stack = []
    for num in arr:
        digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
        while stack and stack[-1] > digits[0]:
            if len(digits) == 1:
                return False
            stack.pop()
        stack.extend(digits)
    return stack == sorted(stack)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        print('YES' if can_be_sorted(arr) else 'NO')

func()
```

This corrected version uses a stack to simulate the process of splitting numbers and checks if the resulting sequence can be sorted. It ensures that all possible splits are considered and correctly updates the sequence to check for sorting.
