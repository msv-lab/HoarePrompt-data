Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The problem requires us to determine whether it is possible to make the array sorted in non-descending order by repeatedly performing the specified operation on elements that are at least 10.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array, `m`, and then the array elements.

2. **Logic to Determine Sortability:**
   - The program initializes a flag `ans` to `True`, assuming the array can be sorted.
   - It iterates through the array in reverse order (from the last element to the second element).
   - If it finds an element `arr[i]` that is less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`, it attempts to check if splitting the larger element (`arr[i - 1]`) can help in sorting.
   - It creates a temporary list `nums` by splitting `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appending `arr[i]` to it.
   - It checks if this temporary list `nums` is sorted.
     - If not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If yes, it updates `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of the split number (which seems incorrect based on the problem statement).
   - If `ans` remains `True` after the loop, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Handling of Splitting:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if the temporary list `nums` (formed by splitting `arr[i - 1]` and appending `arr[i]`) is sorted, the array can be sorted. This is not correct.
   - The program also incorrectly modifies `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of the split number, which does not reflect the actual operation described in the problem.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Sortability:**
   - The program's logic for checking if the array can be sorted by splitting elements is flawed. It does not consider the possibility of multiple splits or the correct placement of digits.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Iterate through the array and check if any element is greater than the next one.
- If such an element is found, check if splitting it can help in sorting the array.
- The correct approach involves simulating the splitting operation and checking if the resulting array can be sorted.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the logic and handling of the array splitting operation, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
