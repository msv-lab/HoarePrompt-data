You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is 0, `a` is a list of the original `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks a list of integers to determine if it can be rearranged such that each integer is greater than or equal to the previous one by potentially concatenating digits of the previous integer with the current one. It outputs "YES" if such a rearrangement is possible for the list, otherwise "NO".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Breakdown

The task is to determine if a given array can be sorted in non-descending order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits. The operation can be applied any number of times.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve this problem as follows:

1. The program reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
    - It reads the length of the array.
    - It reads the array elements.
    - It initializes a flag `ans` to `True`, indicating that the array can be sorted.
    - It iterates through the array from the end to the beginning (from index `m-1` to `1`).
    - If an element is smaller than the previous one (`arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`), it performs the following:
        - It splits the previous element (`arr[i - 1]`) into its individual digits and appends the current element (`arr[i]`) to this list.
        - It checks if the resulting list is sorted.
        - If not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
        - If the list is sorted, it sets the current element (`arr[i - 1]`) to the first digit of the split number.
    - Finally, it prints 'YES' if `ans` is `True` and 'NO' otherwise.

### Issues with the Program

The program has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Checking**: The logic for splitting and checking the sequence is flawed. The program checks if the sequence of digits and the next element is sorted, but it doesn't consider the implications of subsequent splits or the overall order of the array.

2. **Updating the Array**: The program updates the array in a way that doesn't reflect the real transformation of the array. It simply sets `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of the split number, which doesn't account for the possibility of further splits or the order of other elements.

3. **Handling of Multiple Splits**: The program doesn't handle the case where multiple splits are needed to sort the array. It only checks the immediate effect of splitting a single element.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program doesn't handle edge cases properly, such as arrays that are already sorted or arrays with elements that require multiple splits to become sorted.

### Correctness

Given the issues outlined above, the program is not correct. It fails to correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the described operation.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
