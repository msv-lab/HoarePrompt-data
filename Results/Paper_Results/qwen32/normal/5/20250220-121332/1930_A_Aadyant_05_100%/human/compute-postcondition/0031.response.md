The code snippet `list1 = b.split()` takes the string `b` and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This list is then assigned to `list1`.

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `s`, `list2`, `a`, `b`, `str`, `final`, and `num` remain unchanged except for `list1`, which is now a list of substrings from `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is 0; `list2` is an empty list; `a` is the user's input; `b` is the new user's input string; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b`; `str` is undefined; `final` contains the value of `s` appended to it; `num` is incremented by 1.**
