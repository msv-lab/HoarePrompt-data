The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num` and `n`. If `num` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `num` should be increased by 1 from its previous value for the next iteration to occur.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is the sum of all integers at even indices in `list2`; `list2` is a sorted list of integers; `a` is the user's input; `b` is the new user's input string; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b`; `str` is undefined; `final` contains the previous values of `final` plus `s`; `num` is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, so `num` is now one more than its previous value.**

Given that `num` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if `num` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, we simply need to reflect this increment in the state.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is the sum of all integers at even indices in `list2`; `list2` is a sorted list of integers; `a` is the user's input; `b` is the new user's input string; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b`; `str` is undefined; `final` contains the previous values of `final` plus `s`; `num` is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, so `num` is now `num + 1`.**

Since we only adjust `num` in the loop head, the other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is the sum of all integers at even indices in `list2`; `list2` is a sorted list of integers; `a` is the user's input; `b` is the new user's input string; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b`; `str` is undefined; `final` contains the previous values of `final` plus `s`; `num` is `num + 1`.**
