The code appends the integer value of `str` to `list2`. Given that `str` is the third element of `list1` and `list1` contains substrings from `b` with at least 3 elements, `str` is a substring of `b` and is converted to an integer before being appended to `list2`.

The initial state of `list2` is `[10, int(str)]`. After the code execution, `list2` will have an additional element, which is `int(str)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `s` is 0, `list2` is [10, int(str), int(str)], `a` is the user's input, `b` is the new user's input string, `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` that must have at least 3 elements, `str` is the third element of `list1`, `final` contains the value of `s` appended to it, `num` is incremented by 1**.

In simpler terms, the third element of `list1` is converted to an integer and appended to `list2`, which now contains three elements: 10, the integer value of `str` (twice). All other variables remain unchanged.
