To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how it processes the input string `b` and the list `list1`.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initialization:**
  - `n` is an integer between 1 and 50.
  - `s` is initialized to 0.
  - `list2` is an empty list.
  - `a` is the user's input.
  - `b` is the user's input string.
  - `list1` is a list of words from `b`.
  - `str` is undefined.
  - `final` contains the previous values of `final` plus `s`.
  - `num` is incremented by 1.

- **Loop Execution:**
  - The loop iterates over each word `str` in `list1`.
  - For each iteration, it converts `str` to an integer and appends it to `list2`.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will execute once for each word in `list1`.
- After all iterations, `list2` will contain all the integer values of the words in `list1`.
- The variables `n`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `final`, and `num` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified inside the loop, which they are not.

### Natural Language Description:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, `list2` will contain all the integer values of the words from the input string `b`. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `final`, `num`, and `str`) will retain their initial values or be left undefined as per the problem statement.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`list2` contains all the integer values of the words from `list1`, `str` is undefined, `n` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `final` is unchanged, `num` is unchanged.**
