The code snippet provided sets `list1` to an empty list. This means the previous value of `list1`, which was a list of substrings from `b`, is now an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is 0; `list2` is an empty list; `a` is the new user's input; `b` is the user's input string; `list1` is an empty list; `str` is undefined; `final` contains the previous values of `final` plus `s`; `num` is `num + 1`.**
