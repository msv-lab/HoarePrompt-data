The `print(1)` statement in the provided code snippet will output the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `k` as described in the initial state. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output.

Output: **1**
