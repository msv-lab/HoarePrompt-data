The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means that the initial values of `n` and `k` will be overwritten by the values provided in the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input.**
