The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, otherwise it prints `n`. The integer `n` represents the number of elements in a set, and `k` represents a number of pairs that can be formed from the set.
