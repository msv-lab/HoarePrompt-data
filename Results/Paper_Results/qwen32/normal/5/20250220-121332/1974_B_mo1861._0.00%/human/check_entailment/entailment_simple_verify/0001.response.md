### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the original program and the annotated version to determine if the assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Encoding Process:**
  - Construct an auxiliary string `r` consisting of distinct characters of `s` in alphabetical order.
  - Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`.
  
- **Decoding Process:**
  - Reverse the mapping used in encoding to restore `s` from `b`.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program aims to decode the string `b` by creating a mapping from each character in the sorted set of `b` to its symmetric character.
- The original program creates a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to a character in the reversed alphabet order, which is incorrect.

#### Annotations:
- `char_map` is created by mapping each unique character `c` in the sorted set of `b` to `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, which is incorrect.
- The final string `s` is formed by concatenating the mapped values for each character in `b`.

#### Correct Mapping:
- The correct mapping should map each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r` itself, not to characters in the reversed alphabet order.
- For example, if `r` is `"cdefors"`, the mapping should be:
  - `c -> s`
  - `d -> r`
  - `e -> e`
  - `f -> f`
  - `o -> o`
  - `r -> d`
  - `s -> c`

#### Original Program Code:
```python
def func_1(b):
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
        char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

#### Corrected Program Code:
```python
def func_1(b):
    r = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {r[i]: r[len(r) - i - 1] for i in range(len(r))}
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    return s
```

#### Conclusion:
The original program is indeed incorrect because it maps characters to the reversed alphabet order instead of their symmetric characters in the auxiliary string `r`. The assessment correctly identifies this issue and provides a corrected version of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
