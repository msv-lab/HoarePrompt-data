Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s` where each unique character in `b` is replaced by a corresponding letter from 'a' to 'z', maintaining the original order of characters in `b`. The replacement is based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`, with the smallest character being replaced by 'z', the second smallest by 'y', and so on.**
