Let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement step by step.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `b` is a string consisting of at least one lowercase Latin letter.
- `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `c` and the value is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.

The for loop statement is:
```python
for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop:
- `i` is the index of the current iteration.
- `c` is the character from the sorted set of `b`.
- `enumerate(sorted(set(b)))` generates pairs of index and character from the sorted set of unique characters in `b`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
1. The set of `b` must contain more unique characters for the loop to continue.
2. The index `i` should be incremented by 1.
3. The character `c` should be the next character in the sorted set of unique characters of `b`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, suppose `i` was 0 and `c` was the smallest unique character in `b`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1, and `c` should be the next smallest unique character in `b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`b` is a string consisting of at least two lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the next smallest unique character in `b` and the value is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, `i` is 1, `c` is the next smallest unique character in `b`**.

However, the problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head (`i` and `c`) can be adjusted. Thus, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`i` is 1, `c` is the next smallest unique character in `b`**. 

Since we do not have the exact value of `b` or the exact characters in `b`, we cannot specify the exact value of `c`. But we know `c` should be the next smallest unique character in the sorted set of `b`.

Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `c` is the next smallest unique character in `b`**.
