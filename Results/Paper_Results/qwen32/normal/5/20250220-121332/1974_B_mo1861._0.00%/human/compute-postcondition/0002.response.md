The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `c`, and the expression `enumerate(sorted(set(b)))`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the expression `enumerate(sorted(set(b)))`. This expression depends on the variable `b`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

For the loop to execute, the expression `sorted(set(b))` must produce a non-empty list. This means that the set created from the string `b` must contain at least one unique character. Since `b` is already defined as a string of lowercase Latin letters, we need to ensure that `b` is not an empty string.

Therefore, to make sure the loop executes, `b` must contain at least one character. The variables `i` and `c` are initialized by the `enumerate` function and do not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`b` is a string consisting of at least one lowercase Latin letter, `char_map` is an empty dictionary**
