Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly performs the decoding task as described in the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The function `func_1(b)` is supposed to decode the string `b` to obtain the original string `s`.
   - The function first creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorts them to form the auxiliary string `r`.
   - It then constructs a mapping (`char_map`) where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character from the end of the sorted list.
   - For example, if `r` is "cdefors", the mapping would be:
     - 'c' -> 's'
     - 'd' -> 'r'
     - 'e' -> 'e'
     - 'f' -> 'd'
     - 'o' -> 'c'
     - 'r' -> 'f'
     - 's' -> 'o'
   - The function then iterates over each character in the encoded string `b` and uses the `char_map` to find the corresponding original character, appending it to the result string `s`.

3. **Symmetric Character Mapping:**
   - The logic for mapping each character to its symmetric counterpart is incorrect. Instead of mapping each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list, the program incorrectly maps each character to a character based on the length of `b`, which is not correct.
   - The correct mapping should be between the characters in `r` and their symmetric counterparts in `r` itself, not based on the length of the encoded string `b`.

4. **Correct Mapping Example:**
   - For the encoded string "serofedsoc":
     - The unique characters sorted form the auxiliary string `r` as "cdefors".
     - The correct mapping should be:
       - 's' -> 'c'
       - 'e' -> 'o'
       - 'r' -> 'd'
       - 'o' -> 'f'
       - 'f' -> 'e'
       - 'd' -> 'r'
       - 'c' -> 's'
     - Using this mapping, the decoded string should be "codeforces".

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly map the characters to their symmetric counterparts in the auxiliary string `r`. Instead, it uses an incorrect formula based on the length of the encoded string `b`, leading to incorrect results.

**Correctness: False**
