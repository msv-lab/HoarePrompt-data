Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the string as per the problem description. The issue lies in the way the `char_map` dictionary is constructed.

The current code maps each character in the sorted set of `b` to a character in the reverse order of the alphabet starting from 'a'. However, this is incorrect because the mapping should be based on the distinct characters of the original string `s`, sorted alphabetically, and then each character in `b` should be mapped to its symmetric character in this sorted list.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Input:
```
1
5
abcde
```

Expected Output:
```
edcba
```

Explanation:
- The distinct characters in `b` are `a, b, c, d, e`.
- The sorted distinct characters are `a, b, c, d, e`.
- The symmetric mapping should be: `a -> e`, `b -> d`, `c -> c`, `d -> b`, `e -> a`.
- Therefore, the decoded string should be `edcba`.

However, the provided code will not produce this output. Instead, it will map the characters based on the length of `b` and the reverse order of the alphabet, which is incorrect.

To fix the code, the `char_map` should be constructed based on the symmetric mapping of the distinct characters of `b`:

```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {distinct_chars[i]: distinct_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(distinct_chars))}
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    return s
```

This corrected code will produce the expected output for the given counterexample and any other valid input.
