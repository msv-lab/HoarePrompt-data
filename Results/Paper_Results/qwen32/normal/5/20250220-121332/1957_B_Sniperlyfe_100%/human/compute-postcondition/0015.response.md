Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. If `k` was greater than 0, `nums[2]` is 0, `nums[3]` is `min(1 << k.bit_length() - 1, k)`, and the remaining elements of `nums` are 0, and `k` is updated to `k - min(1 << k.bit_length() - 1, k)`. Otherwise, `nums[2]` is 0 and the remaining elements of `nums` are 0, and `k` retains its original value. `i` is 3 in both cases.**
