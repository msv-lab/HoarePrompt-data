Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the remaining elements are 0; `k` is now `k - ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` has been updated by subtracting the value of `nums[0]` from it, while all other variables remain unchanged.
