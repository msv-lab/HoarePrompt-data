Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. If `k` was greater than 0, `k` is now 0 and `nums[i]` is `k` for some `i`. Otherwise, `k` retains its original value. The remaining elements of `nums` are 0.**
