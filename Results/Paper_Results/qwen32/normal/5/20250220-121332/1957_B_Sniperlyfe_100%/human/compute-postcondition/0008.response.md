The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range `1, n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was used to index into the `nums` list. Since the loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 to point to the next element in the `nums` list.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. If `k` was greater than 0, `k` is now 0 and `nums[i]` is `k` for some `i`. Otherwise, `k` retains its original value. The remaining elements of `nums` are 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value between `1` and `n-2` (since the loop would not have ended yet). For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. If `k` was greater than 0, `k` is now 0 and `nums[i]` is `k` for some `i`. Otherwise, `k` retains its original value. The remaining elements of `nums` are 0, `i` is the value from the previous iteration incremented by 1**.

Since the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration is not specified, we can only describe the state in terms of the increment. Assuming `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. If `k` was greater than 0, `k` is now 0 and `nums[i]` is `k` for some `i`. Otherwise, `k` retains its original value. The remaining elements of `nums` are 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. If `k` was greater than 0, `k` is now 0 and `nums[i]` is `k` for some `i`. Otherwise, `k` retains its original value. The remaining elements of `nums` are 0, `i` is x + 1**.

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can generalize:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. If `k` was greater than 0, `k` is now 0 and `nums[i]` is `k` for some `i`. Otherwise, `k` retains its original value. The remaining elements of `nums` are 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

To match the format provided in the examples:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. If `k` was greater than 0, `k` is now 0 and `nums[i]` is `k` for some `i`. Otherwise, `k` retains its original value. The remaining elements of `nums` are 0, `i` is 2**

This assumes that the previous value of `i` was 1, which is the starting point of the loop. If `i` was a different value, adjust accordingly by incrementing that value by 1.
