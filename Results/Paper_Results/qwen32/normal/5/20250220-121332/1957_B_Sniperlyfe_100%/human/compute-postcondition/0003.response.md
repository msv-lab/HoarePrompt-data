The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the loop starts with `i = 1` and goes up to `n-1`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9
- `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the remaining elements are 0
- `k` is now `k - ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`

The value of `t` and `k` do not affect the execution of the loop. The only requirement for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it is initialized within the `range` function.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the remaining elements are 0, `k` is now `k - ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`**
