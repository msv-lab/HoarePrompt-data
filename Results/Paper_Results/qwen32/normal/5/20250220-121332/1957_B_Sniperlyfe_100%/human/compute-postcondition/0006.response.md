The code snippet provided is `k -= nums[i]`, which means `k` is updated by subtracting the value of `nums[i]` from it. Let's consider the initial state and the specific values of the variables involved.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4,
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5,
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9,
- `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `nums[i]` is `k`, and the remaining elements are 0.

Since `nums[i]` is specified as `k`, the operation `k -= nums[i]` translates to `k -= k`, which results in `k` being set to 0.

The values of `t`, `n`, and the structure of `nums` (except for the specific value of `nums[i]` which is used in the operation) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is 0, `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `nums[i]` is `k`, and the remaining elements are 0.**
