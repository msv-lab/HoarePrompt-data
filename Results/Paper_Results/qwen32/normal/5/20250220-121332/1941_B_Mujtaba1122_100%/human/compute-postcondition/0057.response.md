To determine the postcondition, we need to consider the given precondition and the negation of the if condition. The precondition states that the list consists of a series of 1s followed by a series of 0s. The if condition checks the result of `func_1(list, n)`, and since we are focusing on the else block, `func_1(list, n)` must return `False`.

Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we can only infer that the postcondition must reflect the negation of whatever condition `func_1` checks for, while retaining the precondition.

Let's assume `func_1` checks for a specific property of the list or the integer `n` that would make it return `True`. Since we are in the else block, `func_1` must return `False`, which means the property it checks for is not met.

Without the exact definition of `func_1`, the best we can do is to state that the postcondition retains the precondition and that `func_1(list, n)` is `False`.

Postcondition: ***The list consists of a series of 1s followed by a series of 0s, and `func_1(list, n)` is False***
