To determine the postcondition, we need to consider both the precondition and the if condition. The precondition describes the initial state of the list, which consists of a sequence of 1s followed by a sequence of 0s. The if condition checks the result of the function `func_1(list, n)`. Without the specific implementation of `func_1`, we can only assume that the function returns a boolean value based on some criteria related to the list and the integer `n`.

Given this, the postcondition should include the initial state of the list and the result of the if condition.

Postcondition: **The list consists of a sequence of 1s followed by a sequence of 0s, and `func_1(list, n)` evaluates to `True`.**
