The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The initial state describes a list consisting of a series of 1s followed by a series of 0s, and a function `func_1(list, n)` that returns `False`. However, the value returned by `func_1` does not affect the execution of the `print` statement because the `print` statement is independent of the function's result. Therefore, the output will be the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
