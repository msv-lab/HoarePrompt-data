The value of `list[i + 1]` is decremented by the value of `list[i - 1]`. The other conditions and values remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `list[i]` must be greater than 1, `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0, `list[i + 1]` must be greater than 0 minus `list[i - 1]`, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
Output State: **`list[i]` must be greater than 1, `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0, `list[i + 1]` is `list[i + 1] - list[i - 1]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.**
