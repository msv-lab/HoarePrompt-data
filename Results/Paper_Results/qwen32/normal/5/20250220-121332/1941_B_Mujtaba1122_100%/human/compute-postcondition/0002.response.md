The given Python code snippet modifies the element at index `i + 1` in the list by subtracting the value of the element at index `i - 1` from it. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state or in the provided code snippet, which means the operation cannot be performed without knowing the value of `i`. Assuming `i` is a valid index within the bounds of the list, let's proceed with the calculation based on the provided initial state and the assumption that `i` is a specific valid index.

Given the initial state:
- `list` is a list of integers where `list[0] = 1`, `list[1] = 2`, `list[2] = 1`
- `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`

Let's assume `i` is 1 for the sake of this example (as it is a valid index and we need to demonstrate the operation). The code would then be:
```
list[1 + 1] -= 1 * list[1 - 1]
```
This translates to:
```
list[2] -= 1 * list[0]
```
Given the initial values:
- `list[0] = 1`
- `list[2] = 1`

The operation becomes:
```
list[2] -= 1 * 1
list[2] = 1 - 1
list[2] = 0
```

Therefore, after the code execution with `i = 1`, the list is modified to `[1, 2, 0]`.

Output State: **`list` is a list of integers where `list[0] = 1`, `list[1] = 2`, `list[2] = 0`; `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`**.
