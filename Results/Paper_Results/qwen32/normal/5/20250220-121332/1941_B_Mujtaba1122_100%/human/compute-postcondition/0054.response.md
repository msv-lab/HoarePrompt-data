To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and the changes it makes to the list based on the given conditions and output states after the first three iterations.

### Analysis

1. **Initial State**: The list is a list of integers, and `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and the length of the list is `n`.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n - 1):
       while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
           list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
           list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
           list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
       if list[i - 1] != 0:
           print('no')
           return
   ```

3. **Output States after Iterations**:
   - **After 1 iteration**: The list is mostly 0s, with a few 1s, and `list[i - 1]` is 0.
   - **After 2 iterations**: `list[2]` is 0, `list[1]` is 1, `list[3]` is 1, `list[4]` is 1, and the rest are 0s or 1s, with `list[i - 1]` (which is `list[1]` after the first iteration) being 0.
   - **After 3 iterations**: `list[2]` is 0, `list[1]` is 1, `list[3]` is 1, `list[4]` is 1, `list[5]` is 1, and `list[i - 1]` (which is `list[3]` after the second iteration) is 0.

### Deduction

- The loop modifies the list based on the values of `list[i]`, `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]`.
- The loop terminates early with a "no" print if `list[i - 1]` is not 0 after the inner `while` loop.
- The inner `while` loop reduces the values of `list[i + 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i - 1]` until one of them becomes 0 or `list[i]` is no longer greater than 1.

### Final Output State

From the output states provided, it appears that the loop iterates through the list, reducing values and ensuring that `list[i - 1]` becomes 0 after each iteration. Given the pattern, by the end of the loop, the list will be a series of 0s and 1s, with the first few elements being 1s and the rest being 0s, ensuring that no element greater than 1 exists.

Since the loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 2`, and the pattern suggests that `list[i - 1]` becomes 0 after each iteration, the final state will be:

- `list[0]` will be 1 (as it is not modified by the loop).
- `list[1]` to `list[n - 2]` will be a series of 0s and 1s, with the first few elements being 1s and the rest being 0s.
- `list[n - 1]` will be 0 (as it is not modified by the loop).

Given the pattern observed in the first three iterations, the final state will be:

- `list[0]` is 1.
- `list[1]` to `list[n - 2]` will be a series of 0s and 1s, with the first few elements being 1s and the rest being 0s.
- `list[n - 1]` is 0.

### Conclusion

The final output state of the list after all iterations will be a list starting with 1, followed by a series of 0s and 1s, and ending with 0.

Output State: **[1, 1, ..., 1, 0, 0, ..., 0]**, where the number of 1s is determined by the initial configuration and the loop's behavior, and the rest are 0s, with the last element being 0.
