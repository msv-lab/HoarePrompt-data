The code modifies the element at index `i` of the list by subtracting twice the element at index `i-1` from it. Given the initial state and the specific nature of the list, we can calculate the new values of the list elements directly.

Initial State: `list` is a list of integers where `list[0] = 1`, `list[1] = 2`, `list[2] = 0`; `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`

The code snippet provided is:
```python
list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
```

Since the specific value of `i` is not given, we will assume that `i` is a variable that can be any valid index for the list. However, to provide a specific output state, let's assume `i` is 2 (a common scenario to illustrate the transformation):

- For `i = 2`, the operation is `list[2] -= 2 * list[1]`.
- Given `list[1] = 2`, the operation becomes `list[2] -= 2 * 2`, which simplifies to `list[2] -= 4`.
- Initially, `list[2] = 0`, so after the operation, `list[2] = 0 - 4 = -4`.

Thus, the list after the operation is `[1, 2, -4]`.

Output State: **`list` is a list of integers where `list[0] = 1`, `list[1] = 2`, `list[2] = -4`; `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`**
