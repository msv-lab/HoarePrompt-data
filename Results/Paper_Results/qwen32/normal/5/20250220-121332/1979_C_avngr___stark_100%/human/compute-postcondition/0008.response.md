Output State: **The program returns the value of `result`, which is the output of the nested function calls `func_1(func_1(...func_1(numbers[0], numbers[1]), numbers[2]), ..., numbers[len(numbers) - 1])`.**

This means the final output is whatever `func_1` returns after being applied cumulatively across all elements in the `numbers` list.
