To determine the Output State, we need to understand the impact of the code `result = func_1(result, num)` on the variables `result` and `num`. Given the initial state, `numbers` is a list of integers, and `num` is specifically `numbers[2]`. The function `func_1` is called with `result` and `num` as arguments, and the result of this function call is assigned back to `result`.

Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact new value of `result`. However, we can express the new value of `result` in terms of the function's behavior.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements, where each integer is a multiplier (2 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 20); `num` is `numbers[2]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`**.

In natural language, the output state is: `numbers` remains a list of integers with at least two elements, where each integer is a multiplier between 2 and 20 inclusive; `num` remains the third element of the `numbers` list; `result` is updated to the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the previous `result` and `num` as arguments.
