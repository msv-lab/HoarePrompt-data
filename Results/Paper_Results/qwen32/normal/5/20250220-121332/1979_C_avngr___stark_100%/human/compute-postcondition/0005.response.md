The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `numbers[1:]`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the sliced list `numbers[1:]`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements.
- `num` is `numbers[2]` (from the previous iteration).
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must have at least three elements because `numbers[1:]` would need to have at least two elements (since `num` is currently `numbers[2]`, the next `num` should be `numbers[3]`).

So, `num` should be updated to `numbers[3]` for the next iteration.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least three elements, where each integer is a multiplier (2 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 20); `num` is `numbers[3]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`**
