### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to transform the initial state of the boxes (s1) into the desired state (s2) using a minimum number of operations. The operations allowed are adding a cat to an empty box, removing a cat from a box, and moving a cat from one box to another.

The key observation here is that the number of operations required is determined by the maximum of the number of cats that need to be added and the number of cats that need to be removed. This is because you can't move cats to fill empty boxes if you don't have enough cats, and you can't remove cats if there aren't enough cats in the boxes.

Let's break down the logic of the provided function `func_1`:

1. **Counting Cats to Add (`cats_to_add`)**:
   - This is the number of positions where there is no cat in the initial state (`s1[i] == '0'`) but there should be a cat in the final state (`s2[i] == '1'`).
   - This represents the number of new cats that need to be added to the boxes.

2. **Counting Cats to Remove (`cats_to_remove`)**:
   - This is the number of positions where there is a cat in the initial state (`s1[i] == '1'`) but there should not be a cat in the final state (`s2[i] == '0'`).
   - This represents the number of cats that need to be removed from the boxes.

3. **Returning the Maximum**:
   - The function returns the maximum of `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`.
   - The reasoning is that if you need to add more cats than you need to remove, the limiting factor is the number of cats you need to add, and vice versa.
   - If `cats_to_add` is greater than `cats_to_remove`, the extra cats you need to add cannot be resolved by simply removing cats, so you need to perform at least `cats_to_add` operations.
   - Similarly, if `cats_to_remove` is greater than `cats_to_add`, the extra cats you need to remove cannot be resolved by simply adding cats, so you need to perform at least `cats_to_remove` operations.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's consider the first test case from the problem statement:

- **Initial State (`s1`)**: `10010`
- **Final State (`s2`)**: `00001`

Here:
- `cats_to_add` = 1 (only the last box needs a cat)
- `cats_to_remove` = 2 (the first and fourth boxes need to be emptied)

The function will return `max(1, 2)`, which is `2`. This is correct because you need to perform at least 2 operations to transform `10010` into `00001` (e.g., move the cat from the first box to the fifth box and then remove the cat from the fourth box).

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1` correctly computes the minimum number of operations required by considering the maximum of the number of cats to add and the number of cats to remove. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
