### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of cats in the boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`). The allowed operations are adding a cat, removing a cat, or moving a cat from one box to another.

The function `func_1` calculates the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`). The logic behind the function is that the minimum number of operations required is the maximum of these two values. This is because:
- If more cats need to be added than removed, the limiting factor is the number of cats to be added.
- If more cats need to be removed than added, the limiting factor is the number of cats to be removed.
- If the number of cats to be added equals the number of cats to be removed, then the operations can be balanced, and the total number of operations is equal to either `cats_to_add` or `cats_to_remove`.

Let's consider the example provided in the problem:

1. **First test case:**
   - Initial state (`s1`): `10010`
   - Desired state (`s2`): `00001`
   - `cats_to_add`: 1 (at position 5)
   - `cats_to_remove`: 2 (at positions 1 and 4)
   - Minimum operations required is `max(1, 2) = 2`.

2. **Second test case:**
   - Initial state (`s1`): `1`
   - Desired state (`s2`): `1`
   - `cats_to_add`: 0
   - `cats_to_remove`: 0
   - Minimum operations required is `max(0, 0) = 0`.

3. **Third test case:**
   - Initial state (`s1`): `000`
   - Desired state (`s2`): `111`
   - `cats_to_add`: 3
   - `cats_to_remove`: 0
   - Minimum operations required is `max(3, 0) = 3`.

The function correctly calculates the minimum number of operations for each test case as demonstrated in the examples.

### Correctness: **True**
