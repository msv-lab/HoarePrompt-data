### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of cat placements (`s1`) into the desired state (`s2`). The operations allowed are adding a cat, removing a cat, or moving a cat from one box to another.

The key insight is that the number of operations needed is determined by the maximum of the following two quantities:
1. The number of positions where a cat needs to be added (`cats_to_add`).
2. The number of positions where a cat needs to be removed (`cats_to_remove`).

This is because:
- If you need to add more cats than remove, the limiting factor is adding cats, and vice versa.
- Moving a cat from one box to another is equivalent to removing a cat from one box and adding it to another, so it doesn't change the counts of additions and removals.

The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove` and returns the maximum of the two, which aligns with the optimal strategy.

### Correctness: **True**
