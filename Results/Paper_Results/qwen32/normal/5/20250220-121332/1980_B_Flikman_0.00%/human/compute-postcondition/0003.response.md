The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into three space-separated integers, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`. Then, it reads another line of input, splits it into integers, and maps them into a list `a`.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers provided by the user. After executing the code, `n`, `f`, and `k` will be assigned the values from the first line of input, and `a` will be a list of integers from the second line of input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
