t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a list of integers and two integers. Each tuple corresponds to a test case and is structured as follows: (n, f, k, a), where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, f is an integer such that 1 <= f <= n, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100.
