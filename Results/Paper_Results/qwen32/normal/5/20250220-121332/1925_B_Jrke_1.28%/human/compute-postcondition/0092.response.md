The code snippet `l = [ans]` assigns the list `l` to contain only the value of `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is x // n, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`, `i` is 5, `l` is `[ans]`.**
