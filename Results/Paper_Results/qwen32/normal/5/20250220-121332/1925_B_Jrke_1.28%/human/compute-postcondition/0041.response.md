The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect in this context.

Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, or `ans` are altered. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer provided by the input, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value among 1 and all valid divisors `i` and `x // i` that are less than or equal to `k`.**
