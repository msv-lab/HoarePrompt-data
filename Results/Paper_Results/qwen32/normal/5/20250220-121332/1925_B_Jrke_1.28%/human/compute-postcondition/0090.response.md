Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is x // n, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`. If `x % i == 0`, then `l` is [1] if `i > k`, and `l` is [1, i] if `i <= k`, and `l` includes `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.**
