The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 5 and `l` initially contains only the element `ans`, after the append operation, `l` will contain two elements: `ans` and 5.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is x // n, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`, `i` is 5, `l` is `[ans, 5]`.**
