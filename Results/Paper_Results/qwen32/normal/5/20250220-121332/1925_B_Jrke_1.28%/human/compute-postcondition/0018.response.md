Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, and `ans` is 1. If `x % i == 0`, then `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` is `[1, i, x // i]` and `ans` is `max(1, i, x // i)`. Otherwise, `l` is `[1]` and `ans` is `1`. If `x % i != 0`, then `ans` remains 1.**
