The code snippet updates the value of `k` to be the integer division of `x` by `n`. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer provided by the input, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is `x // n`, and `ans` is the maximum factor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. If no such factor exists, `ans` remains 1.**
