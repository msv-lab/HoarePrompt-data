Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 36, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`, `i` is 7, and `l` is a list containing `ans` and 7 if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing only `ans`.**
