The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Therefore, the list `l` will now contain the initial value 1 and the new value `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is x // n, `ans` is 1, `l` is [1, i], and `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`). Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**
