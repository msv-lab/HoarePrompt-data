Let's analyze the given for loop and the state provided at the end of the previous iteration.

The for loop is:
```python
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` is at least 4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x
- `k` is `x // n`
- `ans` is the maximum value in `l`
- `i` is 5

The loop iterates over `i` starting from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)` up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` with a step of 2. This means `i` will take on odd values starting from either 1 or 2 (depending on whether `x` is odd or even), and it will increment by 2 each time.

Given that `i` is 5 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value `i` should take in the next iteration is `7`, provided `7` is within the range.

Let's determine the range:
- The start of the range is `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)`, which means it's `2` if `x` is even and `1` if `x` is odd.
- The end of the range is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Since `i` is currently `5`, we need to ensure that `7` is within the range of the loop. This means `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than `7`, or `int(x ** 0.5)` must be at least `6`. Therefore, `x` must be at least `36` (since `6^2 = 36`).

Given the conditions, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` remains the same (1 <= t <= 10^3)
- `x` must be at least `36` to ensure the loop can continue
- `n` remains the same (1 <= n <= x)
- `k` remains the same (`x // n`)
- `ans` remains the same (the maximum value in `l`)
- `i` is incremented to `7`

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 36, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`, `i` is 7**
