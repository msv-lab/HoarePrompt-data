Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, and `ans` is 1. If `i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x // i <= k`, then `l` is a list containing the elements `[1, i, x // i]`. Otherwise, `l` remains a list containing the single element `[1]`.**
