To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n` in this case. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 because `range(n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and the loop will iterate over this sequence.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `n`**: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.
2. **Variable `i`**: This variable is the loop index and will be automatically initialized to 0 when the loop starts. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.

The variables `k`, `arr`, and `pos` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. They are simply part of the program state before the loop starts.

Based on this, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `pos` is -1**
