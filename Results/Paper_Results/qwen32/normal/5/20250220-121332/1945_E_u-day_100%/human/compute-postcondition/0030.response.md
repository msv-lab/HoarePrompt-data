To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `low + 1 < high`. The values of `low` and `high` are the only ones we can adjust based on the given information.

Here's the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`
- `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`
- `st` is a set containing `mid`
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`
- If `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` is `0` or `n // 2` and `high` is `(low + high) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is `mid` and `high` is `n // 2` or `n`.

The loop condition `low + 1 < high` must be true for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we need to ensure that the values of `low` and `high` satisfy this condition.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `low` and `high` are not directly given but are calculated based on the condition `arr[mid] > k`.
   - If `arr[mid] > k`, `low` is `0` or `n // 2` and `high` is `(low + high) // 2`.
   - Otherwise, `low` is `mid` and `high` is `n // 2` or `n`.

2. **Ensuring `low + 1 < high`:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to make sure `low + 1 < high`.
   - This means `high` must be at least `low + 2`.

### Adjustment:
- If `low` is set to `0` or `n // 2` and `high` is `(low + high) // 2`, we need to ensure that `(low + high) // 2` is at least `low + 2`.
- If `low` is `mid` and `high` is `n // 2` or `n`, we need to ensure that `n // 2` or `n` is at least `low + 2`.

Given the complexity of the exact values of `low` and `high` without specific values for `n` and `arr`, we can generalize that `high` should be at least `low + 2` to satisfy the loop condition.

### Final State:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `high` to be at least `low + 2`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `high` must be at least `low + 2`**
