The code snippet `high = mid` updates the value of `high` to be equal to `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. Given the initial state, `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`. Since `high` is now set to `mid`, the new value of `high` will be `(low + high) // 2` from the previous state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `low` is `0` or `n // 2`, `high` is `(low + high) // 2`.**
