Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Objective**: Given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x`, we need to rearrange the elements of `p` using at most 2 swaps such that after performing a binary search, the element at index `l` is equal to `x`.

2. **Binary Search Process**:
    - Initialize `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`.
    - Repeat until `r - l = 1`:
        - Calculate `m = floor((r + l) / 2)`.
        - If `p[m] <= x`, set `l = m`.
        - Otherwise, set `r = m`.
    - The goal is to have `p[l] = x` after the binary search.

3. **Constraints**:
    - The permutation `p` consists of distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
    - The number of operations (swaps) is limited to 2.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, followed by the permutation `p`.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`**:
    - The program iterates through `p` to find the index `pos` of the element `x`.

3. **Binary Search Simulation**:
    - The program initializes `low = 0` and `high = n`.
    - It simulates the binary search process, keeping track of the midpoints visited in a set `st`.
    - If the element at `low` is equal to `x`, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
    - Otherwise, it prints `1` swap operation, swapping the element at `low` with the element at `pos`.

### Issues and Limitations:

1. **Binary Search Simulation**:
    - The binary search simulation in the program is not correct. The binary search should be performed on the sorted array, but the program performs it on the original permutation `p`. This can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
    - The program only performs one swap if the element at `low` is not equal to `x`. However, the problem guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient, and the program does not handle the case where two swaps are needed.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
    - The program does not handle cases where multiple elements are equal to `x` or where `x` is not found in the permutation.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It incorrectly simulates the binary search and does not ensure that the permutation is rearranged correctly using at most two swaps. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
