Let's analyze the program to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find a way to rearrange a permutation `p` of size `n` such that after performing a binary search, the element at index `l` is equal to the target `x`.
- We can perform up to 2 swaps to achieve this.
- The binary search starts with `l = 0` and `r = n`, and it continues until `r - l = 1`. At each step, it updates `l` or `r` based on the middle element `m` of the current range.

### Key Observations:
1. **Binary Search Behavior**: The binary search algorithm will move `l` to the position of `x` if `x` is present in the sorted array. If `x` is not present, `l` will be the position where `x` would be if the array were sorted.
2. **Swapping Strategy**: To ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search, we need to place `x` at the correct position in the array after up to 2 swaps.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the input and identifies the position of `x` in the array.
- It then performs a binary search on the array and checks if the element at the final `l` position is `x`.
- If `x` is found at the final `l` position, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
- If `x` is not found at the final `l` position, it prints `1` and suggests swapping the element at the final `l` position with `x`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Binary Search Range**: The binary search should be performed on the range `[0, n)`, but the code initializes `high` to `n + 1`, which is incorrect.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Swaps**: The program only suggests one swap if `x` is not found at the final `l` position. However, the problem guarantees that up to 2 swaps are sufficient, and the program does not explore this possibility.
3. **Set `st`**: The set `st` is used to track the positions visited during the binary search, but it is not used for any decision-making in the program.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the solution for all cases. It does not handle the binary search range correctly, and it does not explore the possibility of performing up to 2 swaps as required by the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
