The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `pos`. This means that `pos` will now hold the same value as `i`. The value of `i` itself is then incremented by 1 in the initial state description. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`) remain unchanged unless `arr[i + 1] == k` was true before the code snippet, in which case `pos` would have been set to `i + 1` before being reassigned to `i`. However, based on the given code snippet, `pos` is definitely set to the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `pos` is `i`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
