Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the case where the element `x` is not found at the position `l` after performing at most 2 swaps. The program only performs one swap if necessary, but it does not consider the possibility of needing a second swap to correctly position `x` at `l`.

Here are the key issues with the program:

1. The program only prints one swap operation if `x` is not initially at the correct position, but it does not check if a second swap is needed to correctly place `x` at the position `l`.
2. The program does not correctly handle the binary search logic when `x` is not found at the position `l` after the first swap.
3. The program does not ensure that the final position `l` after the binary search loop contains the element `x`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider both possible swaps and ensure that after performing at most 2 swaps, the element `x` is at the correct position `l` after the binary search loop.
