You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always correctly rearrange the permutation to ensure that the binary search will find the target number `x` after at most 2 swaps. Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search implementation is incorrect. The loop condition `while low + 1 < high` is fine, but the way `low` and `high` are updated can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, if `arr[mid] > k`, `high` should be set to `mid`, but if `arr[mid] <= k`, `low` should be set to `mid + 1` to ensure `low` eventually points to the correct position. However, the code sets `low` to `mid` which can cause the loop to not terminate correctly.

2. **Swaps**:
   - The program only performs one swap if the target `x` is not found at the position `low` after the binary search. This might not be sufficient in all cases to make the binary search successful. The problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, but the code only attempts one swap.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
6 3
4 5 6 1 2 3
```
- The program will perform the binary search on the unsorted permutation `[4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]`.
- The binary search will not correctly identify the position of `3` because the array is not sorted.
- The program will find that `arr[low]` is not equal to `3` and will attempt to perform a swap.
- However, one swap is not sufficient to make the binary search find `3` correctly.

### Correct Approach:
The program should ensure that the target `x` is placed in a position such that binary search can find it. This might involve placing `x` at the middle position or ensuring that `x` is in a position that can be reached by binary search after at most 2 swaps.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not guarantee that the binary search will find the target `x` after at most 2 swaps for all possible permutations. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
