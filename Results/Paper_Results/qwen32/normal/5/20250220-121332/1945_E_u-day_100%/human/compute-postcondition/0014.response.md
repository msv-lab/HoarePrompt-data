The code snippet assigns the value `0` to `low` and the value of `n` to `high`. The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `n`.**
