The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not explicitly mentioned, but we know it must have been some value that allowed the loop to execute up to that point. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. The value of `n` must remain greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively. If the current element at index `i + 1` in `arr` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is set to `i + 1`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1, or retains its previous value if it was already set. `i` is `i + 1`**
