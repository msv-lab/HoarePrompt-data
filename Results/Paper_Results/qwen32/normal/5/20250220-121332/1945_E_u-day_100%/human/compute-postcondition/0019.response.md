Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set containing `mid`, `mid` is `n // 2`, and `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`.**
