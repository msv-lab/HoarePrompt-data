Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to \( n \) and stores the cumulative sum in the `values` array. For each test case, it retrieves the precomputed cumulative sum from the `values` array and prints it. This approach ensures that the program runs efficiently within the given time constraints, as it avoids recalculating the digit sums for the same numbers across multiple test cases.
