The code snippet `sum_value_digits += int(x)` increases the value of `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`, where `x` is the next character in the string representation of `i`. 

Given that `i` is `t + 2`, the next character in the string representation of `i` is the least significant digit of `i`. For example, if `t` is 5, then `i` is 7, and `x` would be '7'. If `t` is 123, then `i` is 125, and `x` would be '5'.

Since `x` is the next character in the string representation of `i`, `int(x)` will be the integer value of that character. Therefore, `sum_value_digits` will be increased by this integer value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is `sum_value_digits` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `t + 2`, `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of the least significant digit of `i`, `x` is the next character in the string representation of `i`**.
