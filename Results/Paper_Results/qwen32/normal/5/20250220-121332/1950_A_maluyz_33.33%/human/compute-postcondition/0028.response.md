The given initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`), but the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NONE')
```

This statement explicitly prints the string `'NONE'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i`. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **NONE**
