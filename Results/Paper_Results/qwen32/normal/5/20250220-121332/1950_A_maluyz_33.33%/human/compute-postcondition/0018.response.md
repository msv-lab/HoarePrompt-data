The `print('STAIR')` statement in the given code snippet is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string 'STAIR'. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`), but none of these variables are used in the print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Output: **STAIR**
