The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The variable `t`, which is an integer input value where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input value where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input.**
