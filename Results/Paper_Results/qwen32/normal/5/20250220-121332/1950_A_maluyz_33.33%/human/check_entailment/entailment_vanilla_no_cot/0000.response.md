Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads three digits. It then checks the following conditions:
1. If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
2. If `a == b == c`, it prints "NONE".
3. If `max(a, b, c) == b`, it prints "PEAK".
4. Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

The second condition (`a == b == c`) is actually redundant because if `a == b == c`, it will not satisfy `a < b < c` and `max(a, b, c) == b` either, so it will naturally fall into the "else" block and print "NONE". Therefore, we can remove this condition without changing the behavior of the program.

However, the main issue is with the third condition: `max(a, b, c) == b`. This condition is not sufficient to determine if the digits form a peak. For example, if `a = 3`, `b = 4`, and `c = 5`, the condition `max(a, b, c) == b` would be false because `max(3, 4, 5) == 5`, not `4`. Therefore, the correct condition for a peak should be `a < b > c`.

Let's correct the condition and see if the program works as intended:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

Now, this corrected program should work correctly according to the problem description.

Since the original program does not correctly handle the peak condition, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
