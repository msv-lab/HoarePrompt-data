Let's analyze the provided initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input value where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('STAIR')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('STAIR')
```
This statement explicitly prints the string `'STAIR'`.

### Key Points:
- The value of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the statement is printing a literal string `'STAIR'`.
- The operation `i = i + 1` does not influence the output of the `print` statement either, as it modifies the value of `i` but does not affect the string `'STAIR'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is the literal string `'STAIR'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **STAIR**
