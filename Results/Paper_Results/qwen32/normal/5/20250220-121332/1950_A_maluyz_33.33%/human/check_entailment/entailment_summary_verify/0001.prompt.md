You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum of the three integers, and 'NONE' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if three digits (a, b, c) form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE".
- A "STAIR" is when a < b < c.
- A "PEAK" is when a < b > c.
- If neither of these conditions is met, it should output "NONE".

### Program Analysis:
1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if it's a "STAIR".
4. It checks if `a == b == c` to determine if it's "NONE". However, this condition is redundant because if `a == b == c`, it doesn't form a "STAIR" or a "PEAK", so it should output "NONE" anyway.
5. It checks if `max(a, b, c) == b` to determine if it's a "PEAK". This condition is correct for identifying a peak because if `b` is the maximum, and `a < b`, then `b > c` must hold true for it to be a "PEAK".
6. If none of the above conditions are met, it outputs "NONE".

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies a "STAIR" when `a < b < c`.
- The program correctly identifies a "PEAK" when `a < b > c` by checking if `b` is the maximum value.
- The redundant check for `a == b == c` is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the program since it will output "NONE" in this case anyway.
- The final `else` clause correctly handles all other cases by outputting "NONE".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
