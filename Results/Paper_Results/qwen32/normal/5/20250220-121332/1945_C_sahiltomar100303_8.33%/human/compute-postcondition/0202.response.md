Initial State: `left` is 4, `mid` is 5, `n` is 10, `rightOne` is less than 3. If `s[left - 1] == '0'`, then `leftZero` is 1 and `rightZero` is 2. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 2 and `rightOne` is between 1 and 3 inclusive, and `leftOne` is decreased by 1.

The code snippet provided is `left -= 1`. This operation decreases the value of `left` by 1.

Output State: **`left` is 3, `mid` is 5, `n` is 10, `rightOne` is less than 3. If `s[left - 1] == '0'`, then `leftZero` is 1 and `rightZero` is 2. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 2 and `rightOne` is between 1 and 3 inclusive, and `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `left` is now 3. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
