Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 2, `t` is `t - 3`, `s` is a string, `leftMove` is 0, and `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to 2 or less than 1. If `rightOne` is greater than or equal to 2, then `rightOne` is greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise, `rightOne` is less than 1.**

To simplify this, we can rephrase it as:
Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 2, `t` is `t - 3`, `s` is a string, and `leftMove` is 0. If `rightOne` is greater than or equal to 2, then `rightOne` is greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise, `rightOne` is less than 1.**

For clarity and conciseness, we can further refine it to:
Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 2, `t` is `t - 3`, `s` is a string, and `leftMove` is 0. `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to 2 or less than 1.**

This captures all the conditions and states of the variables after the if-else block executes.
