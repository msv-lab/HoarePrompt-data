The value of `leftZero` is incremented by 1. The values of `mid` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `mid` is at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `leftZero` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`mid` is at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `leftZero` is incremented by 1.**
