The code snippet provided increments the variable `trightOne` by 1. The other variables (`leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `mid`, `i`, and `rightOne`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `mid` is less than `n`; `i` is `mid + 2`; `rightOne` is incremented by 1; `trightOne` is incremented by 1.**
