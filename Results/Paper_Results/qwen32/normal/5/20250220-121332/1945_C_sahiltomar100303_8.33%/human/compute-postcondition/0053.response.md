Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `s` is the value provided by the user input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`, `i` is `mid + 2`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 3 and `trightZero` is 4; otherwise, `rightOne` is 3 and `trightOne` is `trightOne + 1`.**
