To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

Initial State:
- `left` is 0
- `mid` is 1
- `n` is 2
- `right` is 2
- `t` is `t - 3` (Note: `t` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but this doesn't affect the `print(left)` statement)
- `s` is a string (The exact value of `s` is not needed for this print statement)
- `leftMove` is 0
- `rightOne` is greater than or equal to 2 (This condition is relevant to `rightOne` but does not affect the `print(left)` statement)

The print statement is:
```python
print(left)
```

From the initial state, we know that `left` is explicitly set to 0.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `left`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
