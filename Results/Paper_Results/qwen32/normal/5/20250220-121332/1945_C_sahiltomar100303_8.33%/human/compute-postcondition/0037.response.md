The code snippet provided increments the value of `trightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `trightZero` was initially 0, it will now be 1. Here is the updated state of the variables:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `s` is the value provided by the user input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is 1, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is 1, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is 0, `i` is `mid`, and `s[i]` is '0'.**
