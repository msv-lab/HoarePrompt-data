The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `mid` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`mid` is at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1** (which means if `i` was 3 at the end of the last iteration, it is now 4, so for the loop to execute again, `mid` must be greater than 4). 

To generalize, if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, it is now `x+1`, so for the loop to execute again, `mid` must be greater than `x+1`.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified other than that it has been incremented by 1, we can represent the state as:

State: **`mid` is at least `i+1`, `i` is incremented by 1**
