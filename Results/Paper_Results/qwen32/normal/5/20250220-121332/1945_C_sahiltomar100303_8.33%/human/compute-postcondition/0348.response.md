The code snippet decrements the value of `trightOne` by 1. Given that `trightOne` was initially `0`, decrementing it by 1 results in `trightOne` being `-1`.

All other variables remain unchanged as per the provided initial state.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 1, `t` is `t - (2 - 1)`, `s` is a string, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is `zero_count`, `tleftOne` is `count_one + 1`, `trightOne` is -1, `leftMove` is 0, and `s[right]` is not '0'**.
