Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `s` is the value provided by the user input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are 4, while `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` remain 0. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 1, `tleftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 3, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1, `trightOne` is 0.**
