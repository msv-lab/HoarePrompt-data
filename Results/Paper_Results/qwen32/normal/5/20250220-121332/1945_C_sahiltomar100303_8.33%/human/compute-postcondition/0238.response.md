Given the initial state provided, the variables have the following values:
- `left` is 0
- `mid` is 5
- `n` is 10
- `leftZero` is 0
- `rightZero` is 0
- `leftOne` is 5
- `rightOne` is 1
- `right` is 10 (not equal to `n`)

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(right)
```

From the initial state, we know the exact value of `right`, which is 10. Therefore, the `print` statement will output the value of `right`.

Output: **10**
