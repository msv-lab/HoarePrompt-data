Postcondition: **`left` is not 0, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 2, `t` is `t - 3`, `s` is a string, `leftMove` is 0. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is 1 and `trightZero` is -1. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is 0 and `trightOne` is 1. Additionally, if `right` equals `n`, `tleftZero` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` does not equal `n`, the condition in the if part holds if the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2 - left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2 - right`.**
