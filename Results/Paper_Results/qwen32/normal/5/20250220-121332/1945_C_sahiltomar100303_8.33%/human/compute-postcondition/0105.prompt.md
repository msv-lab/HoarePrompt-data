Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `s` is the value provided by the user input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` minus the number of '0's moved to the right half, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s` minus the number of '1's moved to the right half, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0's moved from the first half, `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus the number of '1's moved from the first half, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged, `right` is `n // 2`.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `s` is the value provided by the user input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` minus the number of '0's moved to the right half, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s` minus the number of '1's moved to the right half, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0's moved from the first half, `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus the number of '1's moved from the first half, `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2` plus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`. `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', otherwise `tleftOne` remains unchanged. `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0's moved from the first half minus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `trightZero` remains unchanged. `trightOne` is less than `(n - n // 2 + 1) // 2` minus 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', otherwise `trightOne` is less than `(n - n // 2 + 1) // 2`. `right` is `n // 2 + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `s` is the value provided by the user input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` minus the number of '0's moved to the right half, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s` minus the number of '1's moved to the right half, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0's moved from the first half, `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus the number of '1's moved from the first half, `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 2) // 2`. If `s[right]` is '0', `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1. If `s[right]` is not '0', `tleftOne` is incremented by 1. `trightOne` is less than `(n - n // 2) // 2` and `right` is `n // 2 + 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `s` is the value provided by the user input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` minus the number of '0's moved to the right half, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s` minus the number of '1's moved to the right half, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0's moved from the first half, `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus the number of '1's moved from the first half, `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 3) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - n // 2 - 1) // 2`, `right` is `n // 2 + 3`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and `trightZero` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `trightOne` is decreased by 1 and `tleftOne` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
