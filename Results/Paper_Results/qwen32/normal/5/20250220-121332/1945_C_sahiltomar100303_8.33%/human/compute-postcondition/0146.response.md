The code snippet provided increments the variable `tleftZero` by 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `mid`, `i`, `s[i]`, and `leftZero`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be at least 1, `i` is 0, and `s[i]` is '0'; `leftZero` is increased by 1; `tleftZero` is increased by 1.**
