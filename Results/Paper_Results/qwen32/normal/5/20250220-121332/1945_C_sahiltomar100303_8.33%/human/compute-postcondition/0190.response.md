The code snippet `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. The initial value of `rightZero` is 2, so after the increment, `rightZero` becomes 3. The other variables (`left`, `mid`, `leftZero`, `n`, and the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid` (which is 5). `leftZero` is 1. `rightOne` is 2. `n` is 10. The character at index `left - 1` (which is index 4) in the string `s` is '0'. `rightZero` is 3.**
