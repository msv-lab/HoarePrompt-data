The code decrements the value of `leftZero` by 1. Given that the initial value of `leftZero` is -1, after the operation, `leftZero` becomes -2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 1, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 10, `t` is `t - (2 - 1)`, `s` is a string, `tleftZero` is `count_zero`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is -2, `leftOne` is `count_one - 1`**
