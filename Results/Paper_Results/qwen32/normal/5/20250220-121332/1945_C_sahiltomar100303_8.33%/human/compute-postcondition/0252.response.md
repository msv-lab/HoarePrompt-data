Postcondition: ***left is not 0, mid is 5, n is 10, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 5, rightOne is 1, right is 10. The current value of right is equal to n. If `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to 6, then `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than (n + 1) // 2.***
