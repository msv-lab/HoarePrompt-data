Output State: **`leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `mid` is less than `n`; `i` is `mid + 2`; `rightZero` is increased by 1; `trightZero` is increased by 1.**

In simpler terms: The counts of '0's and '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s` remain unchanged. The variable `mid` is still less than `n`, and `i` is still `mid + 2`. Both `rightZero` and `trightZero` have been incremented by 1.
