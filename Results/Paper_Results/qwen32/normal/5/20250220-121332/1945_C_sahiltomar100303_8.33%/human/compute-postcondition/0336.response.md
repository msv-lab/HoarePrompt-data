The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Given that `leftOne` is initially `count_one - 1`, after the operation, `leftOne` becomes `count_one - 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`left` is 1, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 10, `t` is `t - (2 - 1)`, `s` is a string, `tleftZero` is `count_zero`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is -1, `leftOne` is `count_one - 2`**.
