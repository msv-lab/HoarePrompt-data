Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the value provided by the user input; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 0.**

The value of `trightZero` has been explicitly set to 0 by the code snippet, while all other variables retain their initial values.
