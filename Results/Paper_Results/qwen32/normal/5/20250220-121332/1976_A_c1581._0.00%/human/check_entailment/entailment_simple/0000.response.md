### Reasoning:
The provided Python program checks if a given password meets the conditions defined for a strong password. Let's break down the logic to verify its correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates over each test case, extracting the length of the password (`n`) and the password string itself.

2. **Password Validation (Function `func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each password string.
   - Inside `func_1`, two lists are created: `digits` and `letters`. These lists store the digits and letters from the password, respectively.
   - The program then checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. This is done by iterating over the password and keeping track of the last index where a digit was found (`last_digit_index`). If a letter is found after this index, the function returns 'NO'.
   - The program then checks if the list of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - Similarly, it checks if the list of letters is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - If all checks pass, the function returns 'YES'.

### Verification Against the Problem Description:
- **Condition 1:** The password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. This condition is implicitly satisfied because the input is assumed to be valid and only contains these characters.
- **Condition 2:** There should be no digit that comes after a letter. This is correctly checked by the loop that tracks the last index of a digit and ensures no letter appears after this index.
- **Condition 3:** All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is correctly checked by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version.
- **Condition 4:** All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is correctly checked by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions for a strong password as defined in the problem statement.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly checks all the required conditions for a strong password by ensuring that no digit appears after a letter, and both digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
Correctness: **True**
