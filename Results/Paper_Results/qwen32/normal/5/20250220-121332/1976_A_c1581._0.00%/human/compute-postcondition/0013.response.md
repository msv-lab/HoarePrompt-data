Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `char` is the next unprocessed character in the `password` string; `digits` is a list that now includes the `char` as its last element.**

In simpler terms, the `digits` list now contains the `char` that was previously the next unprocessed character in the `password` string. All other conditions and values remain the same.
