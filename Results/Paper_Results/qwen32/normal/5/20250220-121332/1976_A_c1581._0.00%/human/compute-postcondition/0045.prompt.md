You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string in the order they appear. `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in the order they appear.
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: 'NO'
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'
    #State: 'NO', `digits` is a list of elements that is sorted
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'
    #State: 'NO', `digits` is a list of elements that is sorted, and `letters` is a list of elements that is sorted
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `password`, a string of exactly n characters where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is between 1 and 20. The function returns 'NO' in five different cases and 'YES' in one specific case.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'

Case_3: The program returns 'NO'

Case_4: The program returns the string 'NO'

Case_5: The program returns the string 'NO'

Case_6: The program returns 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
