Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical flaw. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if the digits and letters are sorted separately, but it does not ensure that the digits are after the letters, which is a requirement stated in the problem description. The code only checks if there is a letter after any digit, but it does not enforce the order of digits coming strictly after letters.

Here is a counterexample where the program does not work as expected:

**Counterexample Input:**
```
1
3
a1b
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
```

In this counterexample, the password "a1b" has a digit '1' between two letters 'a' and 'b', which violates the condition that all digits should come after all letters. However, the code does not catch this and incorrectly returns "YES". 

To fix this, the code should ensure that all letters come before any digits in the password. Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if all letters come before any digits
    if any(char.isdigit() for char in letters):
        return 'NO'
    
    if any(char.isalpha() for char in digits):
        return 'NO'
    
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

This corrected function ensures that the order of characters in the password adheres to the problem description.
