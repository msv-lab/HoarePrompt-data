### Reasoning:
1. **Digit and Letter Separation**: The function `func_1` first separates the digits and letters from the password string. This is done correctly by iterating through the `password` and appending each character to either the `digits` or `letters` list based on whether it is a digit or not.

2. **Digit Placement Check**: The function then checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. This is done by keeping track of the index of the last digit found (`last_digit_index`). If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not `-1` when a letter is encountered), the function returns 'NO'. This correctly implements the condition that no digit can come after a letter.

3. **Sorting Check**: The function checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'. Similarly, it checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Return 'YES'**: If all the above conditions are satisfied, the function returns 'YES'.

### Correctness:
The function `func_1` correctly implements all the conditions specified for a strong password as per the problem description:
- The password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- No digit comes after a letter.
- All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given the logic and the conditions checked, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
