The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `first_row`. Given that `a` is a list containing one element, which is a string input from the user, `a[-1]` refers to this single string element. Therefore, `a[-1][0]` is the first character of this string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list containing one element, which is the string input from the user; `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`; `last_row` is an empty string.**
