The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to the `last_row` string. Given that `a` contains only one element, which is a string input from the user, `a[-1]` refers to this string. Therefore, `a[-1][-1]` is the last character of the string in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list containing one element, which is the string input from the user; `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`.**
