The code modifies the `first_row` variable by appending the first character of the last element in the list `a` to it. 

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer greater than 0
- `m` is an integer read from input
- `a` is a list containing three elements: the first being the original string input from the user, the second being a new string input from the user, and the third being the newly appended string
- `first_row` is the first character of the original string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the second string in `a`
- `last_row` is the last character of the original string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the second string in `a`
- `i` is `t + 1`

After the execution of `first_row += a[-1][0]`, `first_row` now includes the first character of the third string in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list containing three elements, the first being the original string input from the user, the second being a new string input from the user, and the third being the newly appended string; `first_row` is the first character of the original string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the second string in `a` and the first character of the third string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the original string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the second string in `a`; `i` is `t + 1`.**
