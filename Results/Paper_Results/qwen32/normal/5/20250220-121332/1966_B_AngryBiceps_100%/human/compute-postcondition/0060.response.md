The code snippet `a.append(input())` appends the result of `input()` to the list `a`. This means that `a` will no longer be an empty list but will contain one element, which is the string input provided by the user.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `first_row`, `last_row`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list containing one element, which is the string input from the user; `first_row` is an empty string; `last_row` is an empty string.**
