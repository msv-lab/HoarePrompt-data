The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the newest string (which is the last element of the list `a`) to the `first_row`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `m` is the second integer read from the new input
- `a` is a list containing three elements (the original string, the newly appended string, and the newest string)
- `first_row` is the first character of the original string concatenated with the first character of the newest string
- `last_row` is the last character of the newest string repeated twice
- `i` is `i + 1`

The value of `first_row` will be updated to include the first character of the newest string again. Therefore, `first_row` will now consist of the first character of the original string, the first character of the newest string, and the first character of the newest string once more.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing three elements (the original string, the newly appended string, and the newest string), `first_row` is the first character of the original string concatenated with the first character of the newest string twice, `last_row` is the last character of the newest string repeated twice, `i` is `i + 1`.**
