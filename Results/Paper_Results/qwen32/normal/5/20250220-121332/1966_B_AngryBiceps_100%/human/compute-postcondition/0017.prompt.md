Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a` is an empty list; `first_row` is an empty string; `last_row` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a list containing one element (the input string); `first_row` is the first character of the input string; `last_row` is the last character of the input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements (the original input string and the newly appended input string), `first_row` is the concatenation of the original first character of the input string and the first character of the newly appended input string, `last_row` is the concatenation of the original `last_row` and the last character of the newly appended input string, `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing three elements (the original input string, the previously appended input string, and the newly appended input string), `first_row` is the concatenation of the original `first_row` and the first character of the last element of `a`, `last_row` is the concatenation of the original `last_row` and the last character of the newly appended input string, `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
