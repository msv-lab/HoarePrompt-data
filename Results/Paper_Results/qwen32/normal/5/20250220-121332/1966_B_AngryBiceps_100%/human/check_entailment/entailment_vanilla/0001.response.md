Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing a series of operations. Each operation allows you to select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Color Row or Column:** If there is a row or column where all squares are the same color, it is possible to use that row or column to change the color of the entire grid.
2. **Contradictory Rows and Columns:** If the first row and the last row are both single-colored but different colors, and similarly, the first column and the last column are both single-colored but different colors, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because the operations can only spread the color of a single-colored row or column, and there would be a contradiction between the colors of the first and last rows or columns.

### Program Analysis:
The given program checks for the following conditions:
- If the first row and the last row are both single-colored but different colors.
- If the first column and the last column are both single-colored but different colors.

If either of these conditions is met, the program outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid into a list `a` and constructs two strings: `first_row` (the first character of each row) and `last_row` (the last character of each row).

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - It checks if the first row and the last row are both single-colored but different colors using `len(set(a[0])) == 1` and `len(set(a[-1])) == 1` and `a[0] != a[-1]`.
   - It checks if the first column and the last column are both single-colored but different colors using `len(set(first_row)) == 1` and `len(set(last_row)) == 1` and `first_row != last_row`.

3. **Output:**
   - If either of the conditions above is true, it outputs "NO".
   - Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

### Correctness:
The program correctly identifies the scenarios where it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. Specifically:
- If the first and last rows are both single-colored but different, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color because the operations can only spread the color of a single-colored row, and there would be a contradiction.
- Similarly, if the first and last columns are both single-colored but different, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color for the same reason.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
