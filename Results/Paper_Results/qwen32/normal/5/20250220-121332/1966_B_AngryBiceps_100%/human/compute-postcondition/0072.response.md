Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being a string input from the user; `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each string in `a` concatenated together; `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each string in `a` concatenated together; `i` is `n`. The first string in `a` consists of the same character repeated, the last string in `a` consists of the same character repeated, and the first string in `a` is not equal to the last string in `a`.**
