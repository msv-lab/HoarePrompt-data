The code snippet appends the last character of the newly appended input string (which is the last element of list `a`) to `last_row`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` is an integer read from the input
- `a` is a list containing two elements (the original input string and the newly appended input string)
- `first_row` is the concatenation of the original first character of the input string and the first character of the newly appended input string
- `last_row` is the last character of the original input string
- `i` is incremented by 1

The line of code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` modifies `last_row` by appending the last character of the newly appended input string (`a[-1][-1]`) to it.

Therefore, the updated `last_row` will be the concatenation of the original `last_row` and the last character of the newly appended input string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements (the original input string and the newly appended input string), `first_row` is the concatenation of the original first character of the input string and the first character of the newly appended input string, `last_row` is the concatenation of the original `last_row` and the last character of the newly appended input string, `i` is incremented by 1.**
