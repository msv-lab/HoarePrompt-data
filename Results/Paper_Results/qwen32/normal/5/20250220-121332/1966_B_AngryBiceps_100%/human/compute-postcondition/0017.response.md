Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is an input string); `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together; `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together.** 

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- The variable `n` is the number of iterations the loop executed, which means `n` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `m` is read from the input and remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- The list `a` contains `n` strings, each of which was read as input during the loop.
- The string `first_row` is composed of the first characters of each of the `n` input strings, concatenated in the order they were read.
- The string `last_row` is composed of the last characters of each of the `n` input strings, concatenated in the order they were read.
