The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the `first_row` string.

Given that `a` is a list containing one element (the input string), `a[-1]` refers to this single element (the input string), and `a[-1][0]` refers to the first character of this string. Therefore, `first_row` will now contain this first character.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a list containing one element (the input string); `first_row` is the first character of the input string; `last_row` is an empty string.**
