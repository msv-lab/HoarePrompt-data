Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^6. The function returns 1 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns a value `cnt` calculated as `n + sum((n - i*(i-1)) // (i*i) for i in range(2, m)) + (m - 2)`, provided that `cnt` is not equal to 0.**
