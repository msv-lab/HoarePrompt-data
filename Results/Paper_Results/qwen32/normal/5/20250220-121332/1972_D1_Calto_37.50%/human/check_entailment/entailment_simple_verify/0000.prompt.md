You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: The loop will terminate when `b` becomes zero. At this point, `a` will be the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.
    #
    #In natural language, this means:
    #Output State:
    return a
    #The program returns `a`, which is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: `cnt` is `n + sum((n - i*(i-1)) // (i*i) for i in range(2, m)) + (m - 2)`
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `cnt` is `n + sum((n - i*(i-1)) // (i*i) for i in range(2, m)) + (m - 2)`, and `cnt` is not equal to 0
    return cnt
    #The program returns cnt, which is calculated as `n + sum((n - i*(i-1)) // (i*i) for i in range(2, m)) + (m - 2)` and is not equal to 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's analyze the provided code and the problem requirements in detail.

### Problem Requirements Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Provided Code Analysis
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.

### Issues in the Code
Let's examine the `func_2` function:
```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt
```
#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Loop Range**: The loop runs from `1` to `m-1` (`for i in range(1, m)`). It should run up to `m` to include all possible values of `b` (i.e., `for i in range(1, m+1)`).
2. **Incorrect Calculation Logic**: The logic to calculate `x` and `y` and then update `cnt` does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not properly checked.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, when `n` or `m` is `1`.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds true. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

# Example usage:
# print(count_valid_pairs(1, 1))  # Output: 1
# print(count_valid_pairs(2, 3))  # Output: 3
# print(count_valid_pairs(3, 5))  # Output: 4
# print(count_valid_pairs(10, 8))  # Output: 14
# print(count_valid_pairs(100, 1233))  # Output: 153
# print(count_valid_pairs(1000000, 1145141))  # Output: 1643498
```

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
