### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the provided code and see if it correctly implements the solution.

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The function is correctly implemented and returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - This function calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.
   - The logic inside `func_2` is not straightforward and does not directly reflect the problem's requirement of checking each pair \((a, b)\) for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's examine the logic inside `func_2`:
   - The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0.
   - A loop runs from `i = 1` to `m-1`.
   - For each `i`, `x` is calculated as \(n - (i^2 - i)\).
   - `y` is calculated as \(i^2\).
   - `cnt` is updated as `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`.
   - After the loop, if `cnt` is 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

The above logic does not seem to correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the problem's condition. The loop and the calculations inside it do not match the problem's requirement of checking each pair \((a, b)\) for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correctness:
Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. The logic inside `func_2` is not aligned with the problem's requirement.

**Correctness: False**
