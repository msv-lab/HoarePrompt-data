The value of `cnt` is updated by adding the result of the expression `x // y + (i > 1)` to it. The variables `n`, `m`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. 

The expression `x // y` computes the integer division of `x` by `y`. The expression `(i > 1)` evaluates to `1` if `i` is greater than `1`, and `0` otherwise.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `cnt` is `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `i * i`.**
