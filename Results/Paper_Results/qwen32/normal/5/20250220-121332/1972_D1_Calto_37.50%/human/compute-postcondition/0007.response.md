The code snippet assigns the value of `i * i` to the variable `y`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `i` is already defined as `i + 1` in the initial state, but this does not change within the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `i * i`.**
