### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the problem description to determine if the provided program actually solves the problem correctly. 

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Analysis of Provided Program:

#### Function `func_1(a, b)`:
This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. There is no issue with this function.

#### Function `func_2(n, m)`:
The function `func_2(n, m)` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\). However, the logic within this function does not align with the problem's requirements.

Let's break down the logic in `func_2(n, m)`:
- The function iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\) (not \(m\)).
- For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
- It then increments the count by \(x // y + (i > 1)\).

The logic here is clearly incorrect because:
1. The loop should iterate from 1 to \(m\) (inclusive), not \(m-1\).
2. The calculations for \(x\) and \(y\) and the subsequent logic do not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). A more efficient approach involves iterating over possible values of \(\gcd(a, b)\) and counting valid pairs, but the provided function does not do this.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The function `func_2(n, m)` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
