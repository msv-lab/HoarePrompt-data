The code snippet `x = n - (i * i - i)` assigns a new value to the variable `x` based on the current values of `n` and `i`. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `cnt` is also unchanged as it is not referenced in the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `cnt` is 0; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`**.
