Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is 0; `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is 0; `c` is an empty list; `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10.**

Explanation: The value of `x` has been updated to the last digit of `a[i]` by taking the modulus of `a[i]` with 10. All other variables remain unchanged.
