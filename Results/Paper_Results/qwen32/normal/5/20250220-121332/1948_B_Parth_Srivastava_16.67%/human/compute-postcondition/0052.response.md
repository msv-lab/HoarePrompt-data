The value of `n` is incremented by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10; if `a[i] > 10` and `i > 0`, then `n` is either 3 or 4 (since `n` was originally 1 or 2 and is now `n + 2`), and `c` is a list containing `y` and `x` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, or just the element `a[i]` if `y` is greater than `x`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`, `c` contains `y` and `x` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, or just `a[i]` if `y` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, if `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, then `n` is 4 if `y` <= `x`, otherwise `n` is 3, and `c` is a list containing `y` and `x` if `y` <= `x`, otherwise `c` is a list containing `a[i]`. If `i` is 0 and `a[i] <= 10`, `n` is 3, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`; `i` is `i + 1`; `c` now includes `y` as its last element and `x` as its new last element.**
