Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is an input integer, `x` is the last digit of the last processed element in `a` that was greater than 10, `y` is the integer part of the last processed element in `a` that was greater than 10 divided by 10, `n` is the total number of elements in `c`, and `c` is a list of integers processed according to the rules described; `d` is the sorted list of `c`. If `c` is equal to `d`, then `b` has an additional element `1` appended to it. Otherwise, `b` has an additional element `0` appended to it.**
