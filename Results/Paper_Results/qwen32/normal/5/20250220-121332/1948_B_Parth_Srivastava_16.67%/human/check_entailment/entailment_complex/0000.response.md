Reasoning:

The provided Python program attempts to determine if an array can be sorted in non-descending order by splitting elements greater than 10 into their individual digits. However, the logic implemented in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not correctly handle all cases.

Let's break down the issues with the function:

1. **Logic for Splitting Elements**: The function splits elements greater than 10 into their tens and units digits. However, it incorrectly handles the order of digits and the conditions under which splitting should occur. For example, it only checks if the tens digit is less than or equal to the units digit before splitting, which is not always the correct condition for sorting.

2. **Handling of Initial Elements**: The function has special handling for the first element of the array, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Sorting Check**: After processing the array, the function checks if the resulting array `c` is sorted. However, the processing logic itself is flawed, so the check is not reliable.

4. **Example Failures**:
    - For the input `12 28 5`, the function will incorrectly determine that it can be sorted because it does not properly handle the splitting of `28` into `2` and `8` in a way that would allow the array to be sorted.
    - For the input `12 3 45 67`, the function might incorrectly process `12` into `1` and `2`, but the logic does not ensure that the resulting array is sorted.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the allowed operations.

Correctness: **False**
