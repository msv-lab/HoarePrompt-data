The code snippet provided updates the value of `x` to be the last digit of the integer `a[i]`. The variables `t`, `a`, `k`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `i` is `i + 1`**.
