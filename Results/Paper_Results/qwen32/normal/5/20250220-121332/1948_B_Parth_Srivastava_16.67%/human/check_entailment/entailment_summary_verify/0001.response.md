### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, the code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine if a given integer array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` which processes the input array.
   - The results (1 for YES, 0 for NO) are stored in list `b`.
   - After all test cases are processed, the program prints "YES" or "NO" based on the values in `b`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - Reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a`.
   - Converts the array elements to integers.
   - Initializes an empty list `c` to store the modified array.
   - Iterates over the array `a`:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and not the first element, it splits the element into digits and appends them to `c` if the digits can be inserted in a way that maintains the sorted order.
     - If the element is greater than 10 and the first element, it splits the element into digits and appends them to `c` if the digits can be inserted in a way that maintains the sorted order.
     - Otherwise, it simply appends the element to `c`.
   - After processing the array, it checks if `c` is sorted and appends 1 to `b` if it is, otherwise 0.

#### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Splitting and Order Checking:**
   - The program's logic for splitting and checking the order is flawed. It doesn't correctly handle the insertion of digits in a way that maintains the sorted order.
   - For example, it doesn't consider the possibility of splitting an element and then checking if the resulting array can be sorted by further operations. It only checks if the immediate insertion maintains order.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Splitting:**
   - The program splits numbers greater than 10 and checks the immediate condition without considering the broader context of the array.
   - It doesn't account for the possibility that splitting one number might allow another number to be split in a way that results in a sorted array.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Sorting:**
   - The program checks if the array `c` is sorted after processing, but this doesn't account for the fact that further splits might be possible after the initial processing.

#### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the described operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the splitting of numbers and the checking of the resulting order, leading to incorrect results in many cases.

Final: **False**
