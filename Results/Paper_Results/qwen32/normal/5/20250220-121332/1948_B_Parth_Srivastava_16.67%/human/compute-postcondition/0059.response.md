Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10; `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] > 10` and `i > 0`, then if `y >= c[n - 1]` and `y <= x`, `c` includes `y` and `x` appended at the end, and `n` is `n + 2`. If `y >= c[n - 1]` and `y > x`, `c` contains the element `a[i]` at the end, and `n` is `n + 1`. If `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, then `n` is 2 if `y` <= `x`, otherwise `n` is 1, and `c` is a list containing `y` and `x` if `y` <= `x`, otherwise `c` is a list containing `a[i]`. If `i` is 0 and `a[i] <= 10`, `n` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`. If `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10` and `y < c[n - 1]`, `c` includes `a[i]` as its last element; `n` is `n + 1`.**
