### Reasoning:
The provided program is supposed to determine if it is possible to sort an array by repeatedly splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits. The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it processes the array according to the described rules.

Let's break down the logic in `func_1`:
1. **Input Reading**: It reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
2. **Processing the Array**:
   - For each element in the array, if it is greater than 10, it splits the number into its digits and appends them to a new list `c`.
   - The logic for splitting and appending seems to have some issues. Specifically, it checks if the tens digit is greater than or equal to the last digit of the previously processed element in `c` and other conditions that are not correctly ensuring the sorted order after splitting.
3. **Checking Sorted Order**: After processing the array, it checks if the processed array `c` is sorted. If it is, it appends `1` to the list `b`, indicating that the array can be sorted by the described operation. Otherwise, it appends `0`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic inside `func_1` for splitting and appending the digits does not correctly ensure that the array can be sorted by the operation. The conditions for appending the digits are not sufficient to guarantee that the resulting array will be sorted.
- The program does not handle the case where the array is already sorted or can be sorted by splitting elements in a way that maintains the sorted order.

### Example Issues:
- **Test Case 2**: For the input `[12, 28, 5]`, the program might incorrectly conclude that it is not possible to sort the array because of the incorrect logic for splitting and appending digits.
- **Test Case 1**: For the input `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program might incorrectly conclude that it is not possible to sort the array because of the incorrect logic for splitting and appending digits.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the logic for splitting and appending digits, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the described operation.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
