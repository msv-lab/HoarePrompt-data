You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
The task is to determine if a given integer array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits.

### Program Analysis

1. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` which processes the input array.
   - The results (1 for YES, 0 for NO) are stored in list `b`.
   - After all test cases are processed, the program prints "YES" or "NO" based on the values in `b`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - Reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a`.
   - Converts the array elements to integers.
   - Initializes an empty list `c` to store the modified array.
   - Iterates over the array `a`:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and not the first element, it splits the element into digits and checks if the digits can be inserted in a way that maintains the sorted order.
     - If the element is greater than 10 and the first element, it splits the element into digits and checks the same condition.
     - Otherwise, it simply appends the element to `c`.
   - After processing the array, it checks if `c` is sorted and appends 1 to `b` if it is, otherwise 0.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Splitting and Order Checking:**
   - The program's logic for splitting and checking the order is flawed. It doesn't correctly handle the insertion of digits in a way that maintains the sorted order.
   - For example, it doesn't consider the possibility of splitting an element and then checking if the resulting array can be sorted by further operations. It only checks if the immediate insertion maintains order.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Splitting:**
   - The program splits numbers greater than 10 and checks the immediate condition without considering the broader context of the array.
   - It doesn't account for the possibility that splitting one number might allow another number to be split in a way that results in a sorted array.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Sorting:**
   - The program checks if the array `c` is sorted after processing, but this doesn't account for the fact that further splits might be possible after the initial processing.

### Correctness

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the described operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Reasoning: The program incorrectly handles the splitting of numbers and checking of the resulting order, leading to incorrect results in many cases.
Correctness: **False**
