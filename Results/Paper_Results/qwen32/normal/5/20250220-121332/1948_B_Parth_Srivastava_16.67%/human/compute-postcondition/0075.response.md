The code snippet provided appends the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the list `c`. 

Given the initial state, the variable `i` has been incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed. Therefore, `a[i]` refers to the next element in the list `a` after the previously processed element.

The output state will reflect that the list `c` now includes the element `a[i]` that was appended to it. The values of `t`, `a`, `k`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is the last digit of `a[i-1]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i-1]` divided by 10, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` includes `a[i]` as its new last element.**
