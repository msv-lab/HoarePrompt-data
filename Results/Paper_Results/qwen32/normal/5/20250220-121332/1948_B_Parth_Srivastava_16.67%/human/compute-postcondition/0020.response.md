Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is either 1 or 2; `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10; `c` is a list containing either the values `y` and `x` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, or just the element `a[i]` if `y` is greater than `x`; `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0; if `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`, `c` contains `y` and `x` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, or just `a[i]` if `y` is greater than `x`.**
