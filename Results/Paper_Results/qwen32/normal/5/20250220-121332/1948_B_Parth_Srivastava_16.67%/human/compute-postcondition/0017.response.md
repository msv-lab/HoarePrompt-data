The code snippet `c.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `c`. Given the initial state, `c` was an empty list. After this operation, `c` will contain the element `a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is 0; `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10; `c` is a list containing the element `a[i]`; `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0; `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`; `y` is greater than `x`.**
