Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `i` is `i + 1`. If `y <= x`, `c` includes `y` followed by `x` at the end of the list and `n` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `c` includes `a[i]` as its last element and `n` is increased by 1.**
