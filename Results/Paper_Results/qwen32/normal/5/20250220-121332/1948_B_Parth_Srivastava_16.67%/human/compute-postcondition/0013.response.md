The code snippet `c.append(y)` appends the value of `y` to the list `c`. Since `c` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `c` will contain one element, which is the value of `y`.

Given the initial conditions, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `k`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The only change is that `c` now contains the value of `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is 0; `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10; `c` is a list containing the value `y`; `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0; `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`; `y` is less than or equal to `x`.**
