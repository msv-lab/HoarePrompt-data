Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10; if `a[i] > 10` and `i > 0`, then `n` is either 1 or 2 (or 3 or 4 if `y <= x`), and `c` is a list containing `y` and `x` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, or just the element `a[i]` if `y` is greater than `x`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`, `c` contains `y` and `x` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, or just `a[i]` if `y` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, if `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, then `n` is 2 (or 4 if `y <= x`), otherwise `n` is 1 (or 3 if `y <= x`), and `c` is a list containing `y` and `x` if `y` <= `x`, otherwise `c` is a list containing `a[i]`. If `i` is 0 and `a[i] <= 10`, `n` is 1 (or 3), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`. `i` is `i + 1`. If `y <= x`, `c` now includes `y` as its last element and `x` as its new last element; otherwise, `c` now contains `a[i]` as its last element and `n` is `n + 1`.**
