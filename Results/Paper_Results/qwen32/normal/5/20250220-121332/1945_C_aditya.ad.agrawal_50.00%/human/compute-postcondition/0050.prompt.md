Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string`; `z` is the count of the digit `0` in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit `1` in `arr`; `z_r` is equal to `z`; `o_r` is equal to `o`; `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 0; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is `0`, `pos` is `0`, and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is `30001`.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and must have at least one element; `z` is the count of the digit `0` in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit `1` in `arr`. If `i` is 0, then `z_r` is `z - 1`, `o_r` is `o`, `z_l` is 1, and `o_l` is 0. If `i` is not 0, then `z_r` is `z`, `o_r` is `o - 1`, `z_l` is 0, and `o_l` is 1. In both cases, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `1`, and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is `30001`. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is set to `pos` and `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. Otherwise, the values of `ans` and `b_d` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and must have at least one element; `z` is the count of the digit `0` in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit `1` in `arr`; `i` is the next element in `arr`; `pos` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is incremented by 1 and `z_r` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `o` is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is equal to `pos` and `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is the input provided by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is incremented by 1, if `i` is 0, `z_l` is incremented by 1 and `z_r` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `(b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))`, then `ans` is equal to `pos` and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
