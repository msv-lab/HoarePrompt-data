Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user and contains at least one digit; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and has at least one element; `z` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`. If `i` is 0, then `z_r` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr` minus 1, `o_r` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0, and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r + 1) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001. If `i` is not 0, then `z_r` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr` minus 1, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 1, and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001. In both cases, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, and `pos` is 1.**
