Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `z_l` is increased by 1 if `i == 0` and decreased by 1 if `i != 0`, `z_r` is decreased by 1 if `i == 0` and increased by 1 if `i != 0`, `o_l` is increased by 1 if `i != 0` and decreased by 1 if `i == 0`, `o_r` is decreased by 1 if `i != 0` and increased by 1 if `i == 0`, `ans` is equal to `pos`, `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, and the conditions involving `o_r`, `z_r`, `z_l`, and `o_l` remain as they were, and the changes to `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `o_r` based on the value of `i` are still valid.**

In simpler terms, the variable `b_d` has been added and is now equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`. All other variables retain their previous states and conditions.
