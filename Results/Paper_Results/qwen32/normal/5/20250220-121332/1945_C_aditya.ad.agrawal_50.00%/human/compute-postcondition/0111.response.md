The variable `z_l` is set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **After all iterations, `pos` will be equal to the length of `arr` (i.e., `n`). `z_l` will be 0. `o_l` will be equal to the number of 1s in `arr`. `z_r` will be equal to the number of 0s in `arr`. `o_r` will be equal to the number of 1s in `arr`. `ans` will be the position where the condition was last met, indicating the position closest to the middle of the array that satisfies the balance condition. `b_d` will be the minimum distance from the middle that satisfied the condition. `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer. `input_string` is the input provided. `arr` is a list of integers converted from `input_string`. `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`. `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`.**
