The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is a positive integer, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer decreased by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 1.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string`; `z` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `z_r` is 0; `o_r` is 0; `z_l` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o_l` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is the position where the condition is met for the last time; `pos` is the length of `arr`; `b_d` is the minimum distance from `n / 2` where the condition was met.**
