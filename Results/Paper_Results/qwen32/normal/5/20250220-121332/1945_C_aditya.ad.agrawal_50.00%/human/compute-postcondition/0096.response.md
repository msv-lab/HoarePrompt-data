Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user and contains at least one digit; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and has at least one element; `z` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `i` is the next element in `arr` (i.e., `arr[pos]`); `pos` is increased by 1; if `i` is 0, then `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `(b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))`, then `ans` is equal to `pos` and `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.**

In simpler terms, after the if-else block executes, `t` remains at least 1, `n` remains unchanged, and `input_string` still contains at least one digit. The list `arr` remains a list of integers derived from `input_string`. The counts `z` and `o` for the digits 0 and 1 in `arr` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is the next element from `arr` at the new `pos` position, which has been incremented by 1. Depending on whether `i` is 0 or not, `z_l` and `z_r` or `o_l` and `o_r` are updated accordingly. If the specified conditions are met, `ans` is set to the current `pos` and `b_d` is set to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`.**
