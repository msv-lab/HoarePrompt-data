Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and must have at least one element; `z` is the count of the digit `0` in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit `1` in `arr`; `i` is the next element in `arr`; `pos` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is incremented by 1 and `z_r` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `o` is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is equal to `pos` and `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.**
