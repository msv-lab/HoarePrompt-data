Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is the input provided by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is incremented by 1 and `z_r` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1.**
