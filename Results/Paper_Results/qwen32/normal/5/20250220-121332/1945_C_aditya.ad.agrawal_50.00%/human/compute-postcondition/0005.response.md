The code snippet `z = arr.count(0)` counts the number of times the digit `0` appears in the list `arr`. This value is then assigned to the variable `z`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `input_string` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string`; `z` is the count of the digit `0` in `arr`.**
