The code snippet converts each character in `input_string` to an integer and stores these integers in a list named `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string`.**
