The value of `o_r` is decremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is the input provided by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is incremented by 1, `o_l` is incremented by 1, and `o_r` is decremented by 1.
