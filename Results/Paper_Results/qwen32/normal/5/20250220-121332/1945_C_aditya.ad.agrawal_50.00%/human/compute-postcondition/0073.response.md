The code snippet `o_l += 1` increments the value of `o_l` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user and contains at least one digit; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and has at least one element; `z` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `z_r` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o_r` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 1; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is 0; `pos` is 1; `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001`; `i` is not equal to 0**.
