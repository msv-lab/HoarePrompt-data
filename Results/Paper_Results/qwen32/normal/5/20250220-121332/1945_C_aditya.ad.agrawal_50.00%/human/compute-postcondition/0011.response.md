The given code snippet initializes three variables: `dist`, `ans`, and `pos`. Here's how these variables are set:

- `dist` is assigned the absolute value of `n / 2`.
- `ans` is initialized to `0`.
- `pos` is initialized to `0`.

The initial state of other variables (`t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string`; `z` is the count of the digit `0` in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit `1` in `arr`; `z_r` is equal to `z`; `o_r` is equal to `o`; `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 0; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is `0`, `pos` is `0`.**
