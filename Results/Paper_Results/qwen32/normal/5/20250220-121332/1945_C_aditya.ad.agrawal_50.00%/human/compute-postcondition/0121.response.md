The code snippet `z_r -= 1` decreases the value of `z_r` by 1. The initial state provides information about `arr`, `i`, `pos`, and `z_l`, but only `z_r` is affected by this line of code. The other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arr` and `i` is 0, `pos` is increased by 1, `z_l` is increased by 1, `z_r` is decreased by 1.**
