You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5), representing the number of houses. This is followed by a string a of length n, consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident wants to live on the right side. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        input_string = input()
        
        arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
        
        z = arr.count(0)
        
        o = arr.count(1)
        
        z_r = z
        
        o_r = o
        
        z_l = 0
        
        o_l = 0
        
        dist, ans, pos = abs(n / 2), 0, 0
        
        if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:
            b_d = dist
        else:
            b_d = 30001
        
        for i in arr:
            pos += 1
            if i == 0:
                z_l += 1
                z_r -= 1
            else:
                o_l += 1
                o_r -= 1
            if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
                2 - pos):
                ans = pos
                b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)
        
        print(ans)
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: t is 0; n is the last input integer; input_string is the last input provided by the user; arr is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the last input_string; z is the count of the digit 0 in the last arr; o is the count of the digit 1 in the last arr; z_r is 0; o_r is 0; z_l is the count of the digit 0 in the last arr; o_l is the count of the digit 1 in the last arr; dist is abs(n / 2); ans is the position where the condition was last met for the last test case; pos is the length of the last arr; b_d is the minimum distance from n / 2 where the condition was met for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' indicates that a resident wants to live on the left side, and '1' indicates a resident wants to live on the right side. The function returns the number of residents who want to live on the left side and the number of residents who want to live on the right side for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
