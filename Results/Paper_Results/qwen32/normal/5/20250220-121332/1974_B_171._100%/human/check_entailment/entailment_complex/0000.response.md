### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to decode a string that has been encoded using a specific algorithm. The decoding process involves creating a mapping of characters based on the unique characters in the encoded string, sorted alphabetically. Each character in the encoded string is then replaced by its symmetric character from this sorted list.

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Process (Function `func_1`):**
   - **Unique Characters:** The function `func_1` starts by finding all unique characters in the encoded string `b` using `set(b)`, then sorts these characters alphabetically.
   - **Mapping:** It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted list of unique characters maps to its symmetric character from the end of the list.
   - **Decoding:** The function then decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its mapped value from `char_map`.

3. **Output:**
   - The decoded string for each test case is appended to the `results` list.
   - Finally, the program prints each decoded string.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of the Mapping:**
  - The mapping process correctly pairs the first character of the sorted unique characters list with the last, the second with the second-to-last, and so on. This is achieved by the loop `for i in range(len_unique): char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`.

- **Decoding Process:**
  - The decoding is performed by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`, which is done correctly by `''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in b)`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles single-character strings and strings with all identical characters correctly.
  - It also handles multiple test cases efficiently, given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It accurately maps and decodes each character based on the unique characters in the encoded string.

### Correctness:
**True**
