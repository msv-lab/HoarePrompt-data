### Reasoning:

The provided program is tasked with decoding a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves creating a string `r` of distinct characters from the original string `s`, sorted in alphabetical order, and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`. To decode, we need to reverse this process.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b` itself.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - For each encoded string `b`, it finds the unique characters and sorts them to form the string `r`.
   - It creates a mapping (`char_map`) where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - It then constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

3. **Output:**
   - The decoded strings are collected and printed one by one.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Decoding Logic:**
  - The program correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sorts them to form `r`.
  - It accurately creates the symmetric mapping between characters in `r`.
  - It correctly applies this mapping to decode the string `b`.

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program processes multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.
  - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as single-character strings and strings with repeated characters.

### Execution Summary:

The execution summary provided seems to have a slight misinterpretation. The function `func_1` processes a single encoded string `b` at a time, not a list of tuples. It correctly decodes the string based on the described logic.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description.

### Your response:

Correctness: **True**
