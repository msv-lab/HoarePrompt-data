The variable `h1` is explicitly set to the string `'06'`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `h`, `m`, `m1`, `time`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format; `h1` is '06'; `time` is ''**
