To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop for each test case. The loop converts each time given in 24-hour format to a 12-hour format with AM/PM designation.

Here's a summary of how the conversion works:
- For hours from '01' to '12', the hour remains the same, and 'AM' is appended.
- For hours from '13' to '23', the hour is converted to the equivalent 12-hour format (e.g., '13' becomes '01', '14' becomes '02', ..., '23' becomes '11'), and 'PM' is appended.
- For hour '00', it is converted to '12' with 'PM'.

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a time in "HH:MM" format, converts it to the 12-hour format, and prints the result.

Given the initial state and the loop behavior, after all iterations, the output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing the converted time in the 12-hour format with AM/PM.

**Output State: **The output state after all iterations is `t` lines, each containing the time in 12-hour format with AM/PM designation, corresponding to the input times provided.**

In simpler terms, the final output will be a series of times converted from the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format with AM/PM, one for each test case.
