The value of `h1` is set to '07'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `t` in "HH:MM" format and `h` equals '19', `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `h1` is '07', `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `time` is an empty string, `h` is not equal to '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', or '18'**.
