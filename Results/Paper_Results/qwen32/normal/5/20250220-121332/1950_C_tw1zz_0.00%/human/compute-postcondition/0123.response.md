To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to break down the variables and their values based on the initial state provided.

1. **Variable `t`**: This is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440. This represents the total number of minutes since midnight.

2. **Variable `h`**: This is the string representation of the hour part of `t` in "HH:MM" format. To derive `h`, we need to convert `t` to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, `h` can be calculated as `t // 60` and then formatted to be a two-digit string with leading zeros if necessary (e.g., "01" for 1, "02" for 2, ..., "12" for 12, "13" for 13, ..., "23" for 23, and "00" for 24).

3. **Variable `m`**: This is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format. To derive `m`, we need to find the remainder of `t` divided by 60, which gives the minutes past the hour. This can be calculated as `t % 60` and then formatted to be a two-digit string with leading zeros if necessary (e.g., "00" for 0, "01" for 1, ..., "59" for 59).

4. **Variable `m1`**: This is the same as `m`, the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format. So, `m1` is redundant in this context and will not affect the output.

5. **Variable `h1`**: This is the string representation of the hour part of `t` in 12-hour format without leading zeros, except when `h` is "01", in which case `h1` is "01". If `h` is between "02" and "12" inclusive, `h1` is `h` without leading zeros. If `h` is greater than "12", `h1` is calculated by subtracting 12 from the integer value of `h` and then converting it to a string without leading zeros.

6. **Variable `time`**: This is either 'AM' or 'PM'. If `h` is "01", `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is between "02" and "12" inclusive, `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than "12", `time` is 'PM'.

To summarize, the print statement will output the hour part in 12-hour format, followed by a colon, the minute part, a space, and then either 'AM' or 'PM'.

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the hour part of t in 12-hour format without leading zeros, m is the minute part of t in "HH:MM" format, and time is 'AM' if h is between "01" and "12" inclusive, or 'PM' if h is greater than "12")**
