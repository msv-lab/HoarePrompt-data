The code takes the string representation of `t` which is in the format "HH:MM" (hours and minutes), splits it at the colon, and assigns the hour part to `h` and the minute part to `m`. Both `h` and `m` are then converted to strings.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, it represents the total number of minutes past midnight. However, the code does not convert `t` to this format; instead, it directly splits the input string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, and `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format.**
