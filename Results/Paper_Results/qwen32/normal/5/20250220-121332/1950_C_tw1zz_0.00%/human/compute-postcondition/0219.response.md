The variable `h1` is assigned the string value `'08'`. All other variables retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format; `h1` is `'08'`; `time` is an empty string.
