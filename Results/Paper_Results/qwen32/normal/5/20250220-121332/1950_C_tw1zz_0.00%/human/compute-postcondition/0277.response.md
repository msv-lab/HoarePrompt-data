Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440.
- `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input in "HH:MM" format.
- `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input in "HH:MM" format.
- `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format.
- The value of `h1` and `time` depend on the value of `h`:
  - If `h` is '01' to '11', `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is `h - 12` (with leading zero if necessary) and `time` is 'PM'.
  - If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement will concatenate and print the values of `h1`, `m`, and `time` with a colon `:` between `h1` and `m`, and a space after `m`. The `sep=''` argument ensures that there are no additional spaces between the concatenated parts.

### Determining the Output:
- `h1` and `time` are determined based on the value of `h` as described above.
- `m` is directly used as given in the initial state.

### Cases:
1. If `h` is '01' to '11':
   - `h1` is `h`
   - `time` is 'AM'
   - Output will be `h:m AM`

2. If `h` is '12':
   - `h1` is '12'
   - `time` is 'AM'
   - Output will be `12:m AM`

3. If `h` is '13' to '23':
   - `h1` is `h - 12` (with leading zero if necessary)
   - `time` is 'PM'
   - Output will be `h1:m PM`

4. If `h` is '00':
   - `h1` is '12'
   - `time` is 'PM'
   - Output will be `12:m PM`

### Final Output:
Since the exact value of `h` and `m` are not provided, we need to describe the output in terms of `h` and `m`.

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 and time are determined based on the value of h as described and m is the minute part of the input time in "HH:MM" format)**

However, to make it more precise according to the given conditions:

- If `h` is '01' to '11':
  Output: **h:m AM**

- If `h` is '12':
  Output: **12:m AM**

- If `h` is '13' to '23':
  Output: **h1:m PM (where h1 is h - 12 with leading zero if necessary)**

- If `h` is '00':
  Output: **12:m PM**

Since the problem asks for a general output based on the initial state, we can combine these into a single, precise description.

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is h for h in '01' to '11' and '12' for h in '00', h - 12 with leading zero for h in '13' to '23', and time is 'AM' for h in '01' to '12', and 'PM' for h in '13' to '23' and '00')**
