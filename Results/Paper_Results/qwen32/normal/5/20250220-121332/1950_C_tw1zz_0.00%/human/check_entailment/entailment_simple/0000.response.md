Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM designation. However, there is a critical flaw in the handling of the '00' hour. In the 24-hour format, '00' corresponds to midnight and should be '12:MM AM' in the 12-hour format, not '12:MM PM'. The program incorrectly assigns '00' to '12:MM PM'. 

Additionally, the program uses `map(str, input().split(':'))` which will split the input string at the colon but will not correctly parse the hour and minute as integers. Since hours are being compared as strings, the logic would still work for this specific problem due to the string comparison, but it's not the correct way to handle time conversion. The program should convert hours to integers for correct time conversion logic.

Despite these issues, the program does correctly convert other times, but the incorrect handling of midnight ('00') makes the program incorrect overall.

Correctness: **False**
