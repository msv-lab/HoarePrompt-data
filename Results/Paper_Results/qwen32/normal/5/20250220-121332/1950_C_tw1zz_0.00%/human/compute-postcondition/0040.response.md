Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `t` in "HH:MM" format where `h` is '10', `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `h1` is an empty string, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `time` is an empty string, and `h` is not equal to '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', or '09'. The current value of `h` is '10'.**
