Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format. If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` and `time` are determined based on the value of `h`: if `h` is '02', then `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '03', then `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '04', then `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '05', then `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '06', then `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '07', then `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '08', then `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '09', then `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '10', then `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '11', then `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '12', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '13', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '14', then `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '15', then `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '16', then `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '17', then `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '18', then `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '19', then `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '20', then `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '21', then `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '22', then `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '23', then `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` does not match any of the specified values, `h1` and `time` remain unchanged.**
