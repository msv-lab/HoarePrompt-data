The code snippet assigns an empty string to `h1` and keeps the value of `m` unchanged for `m1`. Therefore, `h1` becomes an empty string, while `m1` retains its original value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format; `h1` is an empty string; `time` is determined based on the value of `h` as described in the initial state.**
