Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `t` in "HH:MM" format and `h` is equal to '04', `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `h1` is '04', `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `time` is an empty string, `h` is not equal to '01', `h` is not equal to '02', and `h` is not equal to '03'**

In simple terms, the value of `h1` has been updated to '04', while all other variables retain their initial values.
