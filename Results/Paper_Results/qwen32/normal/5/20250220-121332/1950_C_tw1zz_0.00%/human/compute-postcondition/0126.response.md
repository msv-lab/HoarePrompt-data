The code snippet `h1, m1 = '', m` changes the value of `h1` to an empty string and keeps `m1` as the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format. The values of `t`, `h`, `m`, and the conditions for `h1` and `time` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format; `h1` is ''; If `h` equals '01', `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `time` is 'AM' if `h` is between '02' and '12' inclusive, or 'PM' if `h` is greater than '12'.**
