Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `h1` is an empty string, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `time` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The variable `time` is initialized as an empty string, while the other variables (`t`, `h`, `m`, `h1`, `m1`) retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
