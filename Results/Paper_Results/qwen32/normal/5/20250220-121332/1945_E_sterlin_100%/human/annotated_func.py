#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value based on the user's input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value based on the user's input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. The function `func_2` is expected to read from standard input, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers `n` and `x`, followed by a permutation `p` of length `n`.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing the integers from the standard input split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of integers from standard input, splits them by spaces, converts them to integers, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. This function reads a line of input and returns a list of integers.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were provided as a single line of input, with each integer separated by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a single line of input from the user, which consists of integers separated by whitespace, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters, as it simply returns input(). It is not directly related to the variables n, x, or the permutation p described in the problem statement.
def func_4():
    return input()
    #The program returns whatever string the user inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns a string provided by the user through input().

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_5`. Therefore, no precondition can be derived from the function signature alone.
def func_5():
    return input().split()
    #The program returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string at each whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string at each whitespace.
