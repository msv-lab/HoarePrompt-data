Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the solution to the problem at all. The code only includes input reading functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) and does not contain any logic for solving the problem of rearranging the permutation and performing the binary search as described. The code does not handle any of the test cases or provide any output, which is required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
