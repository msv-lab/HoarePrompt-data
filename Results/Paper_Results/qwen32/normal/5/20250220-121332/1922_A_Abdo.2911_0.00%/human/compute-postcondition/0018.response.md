The code snippet appends the character `a[i]` to the list `template`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list that now includes an additional element, which is `a[i]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
