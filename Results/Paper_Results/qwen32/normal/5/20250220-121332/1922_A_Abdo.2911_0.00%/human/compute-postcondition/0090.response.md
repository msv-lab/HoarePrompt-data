The code snippet provided updates the value of `b` by reading a new input string and removing any leading or trailing whitespace. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `c`, `template`, `match_a_b`, `match_c`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the character from `a` if it matches the character from `b` at the same index, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match; `match_a_b` is `True` if no conditions within the loop caused it to be set to `False` during any of the `n` iterations. Otherwise, `match_a_b` is `False`; `match_c` is `True` if no conditions within the loop caused it to be set to `False` during any of the `n` iterations. Otherwise, `match_c` is `False`; `i` is `n`.**
