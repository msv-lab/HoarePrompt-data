The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `template`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `template` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is an empty list.**
