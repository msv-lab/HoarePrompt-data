Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise it is the index at which the break occurred; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `template` contains `a[i]` at that position; `match_a_b` is `True` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise it is `False`; `match_c` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is the index at which the break occurred if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `template[i]` is lowercase, otherwise it remains `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `False` if the loop breaks, otherwise it is `True`; `match_c` is `False` if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `template[i]` is lowercase, otherwise it remains `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is `i + 1` if `i < n - 1`; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `False` if the loop breaks, otherwise it is `True`; `match_c` is `False` if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `template[i]` is lowercase, otherwise it remains `True`. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_c` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `template[i]` is uppercase and `c[i].lower()` is not equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `match_c` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is incremented by 1; `template` and `match_a_b` remain as per their definitions and values from the previous iteration. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, or if `template[i]` is not lowercase and `c[i].lower()` is not equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is set to False and the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `match_c` retains its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
