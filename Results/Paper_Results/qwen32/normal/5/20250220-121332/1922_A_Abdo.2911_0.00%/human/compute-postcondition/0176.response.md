The code snippet `b = input().strip()` updates the variable `b` by reading a new string input from the user and removing any leading or trailing whitespace.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` â‰¤ 999; `n` is the integer value of user input; `a` is the string value of user input with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the new string value of user input with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is a string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` where each character at index `i` is either the character of `a[i]` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]`; `i` is the integer value of user input; If `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, then `match_a_b` remains `True` and `match_c` remains `False`. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True` (or both).**
