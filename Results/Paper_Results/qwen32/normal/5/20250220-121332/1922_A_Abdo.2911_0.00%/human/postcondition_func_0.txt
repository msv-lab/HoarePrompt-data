The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It then determines if the string `c` matches a specific pattern derived from `a` and `b`, and prints "YES" if `c` matches the pattern and "NO" otherwise. The pattern is such that for each position, if `a` and `b` have the same character, `c` must also have the same character; if `a` and `b` differ, `c` must not have the same character as either `a` or `b` at that position.
