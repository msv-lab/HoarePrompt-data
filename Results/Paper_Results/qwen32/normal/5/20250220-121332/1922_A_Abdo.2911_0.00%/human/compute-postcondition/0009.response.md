The code snippet `template.append(a[i])` appends the character at position `i` in string `a` to the list `template`. 

Given the initial state, the character at position `i` in `a` is equal to the character at position `i` in `b`, but this condition does not affect the execution of the current line of code. The only change is that the list `template` will now contain the character `a[i]` as its first (or next) element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the character `a[i]`; at the current index `i`, the character at position `i` in `a` is equal to the character at position `i` in `b`.**
