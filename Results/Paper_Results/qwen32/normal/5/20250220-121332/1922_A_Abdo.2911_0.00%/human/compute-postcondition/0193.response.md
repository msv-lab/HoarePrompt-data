Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` â‰¤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values of user input with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is `n-1` (the last index of the range `n`); `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `template` contains `a[i]` at that position. If `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, then `match_a_b` remains `True` and `match_c` remains `False`. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True` (or both).`**

In simple terms: After the loop finishes executing all `n` iterations, `template` will be a list of characters from the string `a`, where each character is either in its original form or uppercase if it did not match the corresponding character in `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c` remain unchanged except for `i`, which will be `n-1` after the loop completes.
