Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the character from `a` if it matches the character from `b` at the same index, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match; `match_a_b` is `True` if no conditions within the loop caused it to be set to `False` during any of the `n` iterations. Otherwise, `match_a_b` is `False`; `match_c` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the character from `a` if it matches the character from `b` at the same index, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` and `match_c` are set to `False`. If `template[i]` is uppercase and `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is set to `False` and the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `match_a_b` and `match_c` retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the character from `a` if it matches the character from `b` at the same index, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match; if `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_c` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; if `template[i]` is uppercase and `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `match_a_b` and `match_c` retain their original values; `i` is 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 5; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the character from `a` if it matches the character from `b` at the same index, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match; if `template[i].islower()` and `c[i] != template[i]`, then `match_c` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; if `template[i].isupper()` and `c[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `match_c` retains its original value; `i` is 5.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
