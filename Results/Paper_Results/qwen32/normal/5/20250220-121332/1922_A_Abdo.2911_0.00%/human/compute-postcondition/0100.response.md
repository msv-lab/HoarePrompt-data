The code appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the list `template`. 

Given that `i` is 1, `template` will now contain the first character of `a` (which it already does) and the second character of `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the first character of `a` and the second character of `a`; `match_a_b` is `True`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 1**.
