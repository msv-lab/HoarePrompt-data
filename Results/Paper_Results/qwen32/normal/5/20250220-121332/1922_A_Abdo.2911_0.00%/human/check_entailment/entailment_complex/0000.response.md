### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by creating a template string based on the comparison of strings `a` and `b`. The template is constructed such that:

- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then the template at position `i` is `a[i]`.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then the template at position `i` is `a[i].upper()`.

After constructing the template, the program checks if both `a` and `b` match the template according to the rules specified (lowercase letters must match exactly, and uppercase letters must not match the lowercase version). It also checks if `c` does not match the template under the same rules.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Template Construction**:
   - For each character position `i` from `0` to `n-1`, if `a[i] == b[i]`, the template character at position `i` is set to `a[i]`.
   - If `a[i] != b[i]`, the template character at position `i` is set to `a[i].upper()`.

2. **Matching Check for `a` and `b`**:
   - For each character position `i` from `0` to `n-1`, if the template character is lowercase, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` must match this character.
   - If the template character is uppercase, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` must not match the lowercase version of this character.

3. **Non-Matching Check for `c`**:
   - For each character position `i` from `0` to `n-1`, if the template character is lowercase, `c[i]` must match this character.
   - If the template character is uppercase, `c[i]` must not match the lowercase version of this character.

4. **Final Decision**:
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not match the template, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The logic appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description. The program constructs the template appropriately and checks the matching conditions accurately for `a`, `b`, and `c`.
