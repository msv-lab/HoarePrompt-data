Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the character from `a` if it matches the character from `b` at the same index, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match; if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is `False` and `match_c` is `False`; otherwise, `match_a_b` and `match_c` retain their original values. `template[i]` is a lowercase character.**
