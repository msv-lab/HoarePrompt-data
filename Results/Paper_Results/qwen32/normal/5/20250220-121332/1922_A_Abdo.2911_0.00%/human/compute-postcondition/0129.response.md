The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Since the loop iterates over the range of `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `template`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` where each character at index `i` is either the character of `a[i]` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]`. If `template[i]` is lowercase, `match_a_b` is `False` if either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If `template[i]` is uppercase, `match_a_b` is `False` if `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`. `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 2**
