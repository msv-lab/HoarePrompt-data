Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` â‰¤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is the index at which the break occurred; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `False`; `match_c` is `False`; `template[i]` is a lowercase character; `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `template`, `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `template[i]`, and `c[i]` remain unchanged. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
