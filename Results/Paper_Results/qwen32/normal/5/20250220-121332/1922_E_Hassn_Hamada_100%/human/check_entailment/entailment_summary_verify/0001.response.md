### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary in the context of the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to find an array of integers such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. If no such array exists, output `-1`. Otherwise, output the length of the array and the array itself.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `X` (not `n - 1`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence of numbers that results in exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The function uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
   - It calculates the size and value of the sequence based on the binary representation of `X - 1`.
   - The function appends elements to the `sequence` list based on the calculated size and overlap.

3. **Output**:
   - After generating the sequence, the program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `X - 1` as the argument. This is correct based on the logic inside `func_1`, which seems to be using binary representation to determine the structure of the sequence.

2. **Incorrect Base Case**:
   - The base case of the function `func_1` returns `(0, 0)` when `number == 0`. However, the function is supposed to modify the `sequence` list, not return a tuple. This return statement does not affect the sequence itself but is misleading.

3. **Logic for Sequence Generation**:
   - The logic inside the function `func_1` is based on generating binary representations and calculating the size of the sequence. This logic is designed to ensure that the generated sequence has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Specifically, the sequence is constructed such that the number of increasing subsequences corresponds to the binary representation of `X - 1`.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where it's impossible to find such an array. However, the logic inside `func_1` inherently handles this by ensuring that the sequence is constructed only if `X` can be represented in the binary form required. If `X` cannot be represented in this form, the sequence will not be constructed correctly, and the output will not match the expected number of subsequences. The problem constraints (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) are within the range that can be handled by the binary representation logic.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary states that `func_1` generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and modifies the `sequence` list. It also mentions that the function always returns `(0, 0)`, but this return value does not affect the sequence itself.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic to generate a sequence with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The function `func_1` uses a binary representation approach to ensure the correct number of subsequences. Although the base case return value `(0, 0)` is misleading, it does not affect the sequence generation. The program does not explicitly handle impossible cases, but the logic inherently ensures that only valid sequences are generated within the given constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
