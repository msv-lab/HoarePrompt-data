To determine the final state of the `sequence` list after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior. The loop runs for `size - overlap` iterations, which in this case is `6 - 1 = 5` iterations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's execution:
1. **First iteration (i = 0)**: `sequence.append(0 + 1)`, so `sequence` becomes `[1]`.
2. **Second iteration (i = 1)**: `sequence.append(1 + 1)`, so `sequence` becomes `[1, 2]`.
3. **Third iteration (i = 2)**: `sequence.append(2 + 1)`, so `sequence` becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.
4. **Fourth iteration (i = 3)**: `sequence.append(3 + 1)`, so `sequence` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
5. **Fifth iteration (i = 4)**: `sequence.append(4 + 1)`, so `sequence` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

Thus, after all iterations, the `sequence` list will contain the numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

Output State: **`size` is 6, `overlap` is 1, `sequence` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]**.

In natural language, after all the loop iterations have finished, the `sequence` list contains the numbers 1 through 5, and the values of `size` and `overlap` remain unchanged.
