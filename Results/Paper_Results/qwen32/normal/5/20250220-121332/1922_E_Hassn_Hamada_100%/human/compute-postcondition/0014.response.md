Output State: **`number` must be at least 15, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one integer where each integer X in `sequence` satisfies 2 <= X <= 10^18, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `size` is 4, `i` is 0, `value` is 7**

Natural language: The value of `size` has been incremented by 1, changing it from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
