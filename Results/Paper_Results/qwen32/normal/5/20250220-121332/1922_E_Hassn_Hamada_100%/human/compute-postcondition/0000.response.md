The provided Python code snippet is a function definition with a docstring explaining its purpose. The actual implementation of the function is missing. Since there is no code inside the function to execute, the variables `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 1 <= number <= 1000, and `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X in `sequence` satisfies 2 <= X <= 10^18.**
