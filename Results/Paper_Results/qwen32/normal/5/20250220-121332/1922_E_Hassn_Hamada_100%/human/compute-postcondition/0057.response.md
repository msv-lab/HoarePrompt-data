The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `size - overlap`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the expression `size - overlap`. If `i` is less than `size - overlap`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 (since `size` is 6 and `overlap` is 1, the loop runs for `i` values 0, 1, 2, and 3). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 4. The condition `i < size - overlap` translates to `i < 6 - 1` or `i < 5`. Since `i` is now 4, the loop can execute again.

The state of `sequence` is not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted here. The values of `size` and `overlap` also do not change in the loop head.

State: **`size` is 6, `overlap` is 1, `i` is 4**
