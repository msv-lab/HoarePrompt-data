The code snippet unpacks the tuple `size_overlap` into the variables `size` and `overlap`. Given the initial state `(6, 1)`, this means `size` will be assigned the value `6` and `overlap` will be assigned the value `1`. The initial state only specifies the tuple, so we can infer that `size_overlap` is `(6, 1)`.

Output State: **`size` is 6, `overlap` is 1**
