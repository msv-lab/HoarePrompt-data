The given code snippet assigns values to `size` and `value` based on the variable `i`. However, `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine specific numerical values for `size` and `value`. We can only express them in terms of `i`.

Here's the impact of the code:
- `size` is assigned the value `i + 1`.
- `value` is assigned the value `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`, which simplifies to `2**(i + 1) - 2**i` or `2**i`.

The variables `number`, `sequence`, and `size_overlap` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 1 <= number <= 1000, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one integer where each integer X in `sequence` satisfies 2 <= X <= 10^18, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `size` is `i + 1`, `value` is `2**i`**.
