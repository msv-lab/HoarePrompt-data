Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. Here are the reasons:

1. **Function Call Issue**: The function `func_1` is called with `n - 1` as the first argument, but `func_1` is expected to generate a sequence that results in exactly `n` increasing subsequences, not `n - 1`.

2. **Return Values from `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to modify the `sequence` list in place and does not need to return any values. However, it currently returns a tuple `(0, 0)` in the base case, which is unused and unnecessary.

3. **Logic for Sequence Generation**: The logic inside `func_1` is complex and not straightforward to verify without a detailed mathematical proof. However, the approach seems to be attempting to generate a sequence based on binary representation and power of two calculations, which may not correctly generate the required number of increasing subsequences for all values of `X`.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. It should print `-1` in such cases, but the provided logic does not account for this.

5. **Output Format**: The program does not handle the output format correctly for the case when it is impossible to find the array. It should print `-1` on a single line, but the current implementation does not do this.

Given these issues, the program is not correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.
