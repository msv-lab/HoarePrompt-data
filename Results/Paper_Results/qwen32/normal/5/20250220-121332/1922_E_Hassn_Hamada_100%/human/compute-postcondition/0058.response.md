The code appends the value of `i + overlap` to the `sequence` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 4 and `overlap` is 1, so `i + overlap` equals 5. Therefore, the value 5 is appended to the `sequence` list. The values of `size`, `overlap`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`size` is 6, `overlap` is 1, `i` is 4, `sequence` contains 5**.
