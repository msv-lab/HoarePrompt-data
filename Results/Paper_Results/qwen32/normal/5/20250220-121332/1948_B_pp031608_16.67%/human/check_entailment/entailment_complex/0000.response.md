Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described. The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer array, and checks if it's possible to sort the array using the specified operation.

### Key Points in the Program:
1. **Reading Input:** The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
2. **Checking Sorted Condition:** It uses a function `func_1` to check if the array is sorted.
3. **Transformation Logic:** If the array is not sorted, it attempts to perform the transformation by splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits, inserting them back into the array, and then checking again if the array is sorted.
4. **Output:** It prints "YES" if the array can be sorted using the transformation, otherwise "NO".

### Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`:** This function correctly checks if the list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version.
- **Transformation Logic:** The logic for splitting elements and inserting them back seems correct, but there are some issues with the implementation:
  - The transformation logic is only applied once per pair of elements that are out of order. However, the transformation might need to be applied multiple times to a single element to achieve a sorted array.
  - The loop only checks the immediate pair of elements `(list1[p - 1], list1[p])` and modifies the list only if `list1[p - 1] > list1[p]` and `list1[p - 1] > 10`. It does not handle cases where the transformation might affect elements that are further in the list.
  - The loop does not restart from the beginning of the list after making a change, which means it might miss opportunities to sort the list further.

### Example:
For the input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```
- The first test case should output "YES" because splitting `12` into `1` and `2` results in the sorted array `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`.
- The second test case should output "NO" because no transformation can sort the array.
- The third test case should output "YES" because the array is already sorted.

However, the provided program does not correctly handle these cases due to the limitations mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not fully implement the required transformation logic to ensure that the array can be sorted. It only performs a single pass with limited checks and transformations.

**Correctness: False**
