Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Logical Flow Error**: The program attempts to sort the list by splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10, but it does not correctly handle the process. The loop `for p in range(1, len(list1)):` is flawed because it doesn't ensure that the list is checked and modified correctly. The condition `if not func_1(list1):` is checked once per iteration, and if the list is not sorted, it only attempts a single split operation on the previous element. This is not sufficient to ensure the list becomes sorted.

2. **Incorrect Splitting Mechanism**: The logic for splitting a number into its digits is not correctly implemented. The lines `list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)` and `list1.insert(p, a % 10)` are incorrect because `a // 10` and `a % 10` do not correctly split a number into its digits. For example, `12 // 10` is `1` and `12 % 10` is `2`, but this logic does not work for numbers like `45` (it would insert `4` and `5` in the wrong order).

3. **Infinite Loop Possibility**: The program does not guarantee that it will terminate after a finite number of operations. If the list cannot be sorted by the allowed operations, the program might get stuck in an infinite loop or incorrect state.

4. **Function `func_1` Usage**: The function `func_1` is used to check if the list is sorted, but it is not called in a way that ensures all possible splits have been considered.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should repeatedly attempt to split numbers and check if the list can be sorted. This might involve a more sophisticated approach, such as a backtracking or a greedy algorithm, to ensure all possible transformations are considered.
