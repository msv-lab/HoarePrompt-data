Correctness: **False**

The issue with the provided program is that the dictionary `d` is being used to store the prefix balances with positions as keys, but the keys are not unique (since multiple positions can have the same prefix balance). When sorting, this can lead to incorrect results because the dictionary keys are not being used correctly to maintain the order of characters.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balances = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        balances.append((balance, -(i + 1), s[i]))
    
    balances.sort()
    ans = ''.join(char for _, _, char in balances)
    return ans

n = input()
print(func_1(n))
```

In this corrected version, we store tuples of `(balance, -position, character)` in a list `balances`. Sorting this list will correctly handle the sorting criteria as described in the problem statement. The negative position is used to break ties in decreasing order of position.
