Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index `3 + 2n + 1` to `3 + 3n + 1`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 2n + 1 + n`; `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 1; `results` is a list containing the previously appended values of `result` and the new `result` from `func_1(arr)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`.**

Explanation: The `results` list now includes the new `result` value that was returned by `func_1(arr)`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
