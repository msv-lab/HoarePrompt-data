Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index `3 + n` to `3 + 2n`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 2n`; `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 2; `results` is a list containing the values of `result` (previously appended) and the new `result` from `func_1(arr)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**

In natural language: The `results` list now includes the previously stored `result` value and the newly appended `result` value, which is the output of `func_1(arr)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
