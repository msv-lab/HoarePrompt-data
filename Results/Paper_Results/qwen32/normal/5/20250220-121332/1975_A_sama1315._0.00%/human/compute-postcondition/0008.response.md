Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with length `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element in `arr` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `index` is 2; `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 1; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**

In simple terms, the only change is that the value of `index` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
