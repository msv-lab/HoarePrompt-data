The code snippet appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. The values of `arr`, `data`, `index`, `t`, `n`, and `result` remain unchanged. The only change is that `results` now contains the value of `result`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index 2 to `2 + n`, where each element in `arr` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 1; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**.
