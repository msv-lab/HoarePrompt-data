To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index 2 to `2 + n`, where each element in `arr` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `index` is `2 + n`.
- `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 1.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.

The code snippet:
```
result = func_1(arr)
```

This line of code calls a function `func_1` with `arr` as the argument and assigns the return value of this function to the variable `result`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the specific value of `result`. However, we know that `result` will hold whatever value `func_1` returns when called with `arr`.

The other variables (`arr`, `data`, `index`, `t`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index 2 to `2 + n`, where each element in `arr` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 1; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`.**
