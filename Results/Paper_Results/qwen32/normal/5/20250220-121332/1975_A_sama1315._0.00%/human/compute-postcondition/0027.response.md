Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index `1 + t * (n + 1)` to `1 + t * (n + 1) + n`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `1 + t * (n + 1) + n`; `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 1; `results` is a list containing the values of `result` (previously appended) and the new `result` from `func_1(arr)` for all `t` iterations; `n` is the integer value of `data[1 + (t-1) * (n + 1)]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)` for the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, `arr` will be the last list of integers processed, derived from the `data` list. The `index` will point right after the last processed list of integers. The `results` list will contain the results of `func_1(arr)` for each of the `t` iterations. The variable `n` will hold the length of the last processed list of integers, and `result` will be the output of the last call to `func_1(arr)`.
