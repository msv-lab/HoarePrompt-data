Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly determine whether an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the described operation (splitting the array into a prefix and suffix and swapping them). The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted or if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements that are out of order. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted using the allowed operation.

To illustrate, consider the following counterexample:
Input:
```
1
4
3 4 1 2
```
Expected Output:
```
Yes
```
Explanation:
By splitting the array into `x=[3, 4]` and `y=[1, 2]`, and then swapping them to get `y + x = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

However, the provided code will output "No" for this input because it only checks for adjacent elements and does not consider the possibility of sorting through the described operation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
