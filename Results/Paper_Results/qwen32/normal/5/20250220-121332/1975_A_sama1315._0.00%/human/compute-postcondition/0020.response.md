The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use. Since the loop head does not contain any variables that we need to adjust, the state of the other variables in the program will be the same at the start of the next iteration.

However, we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, which depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 2. Since the loop runs `t` times, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0.

Given that the loop head does not contain any variables to adjust directly, we need to consider the state of `t` which controls the loop execution. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index `3 + n` to `3 + 2n`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 2n`; `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 1; `results` is a list containing the values of `result` (previously appended) and the new `result` from `func_1(arr)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**
