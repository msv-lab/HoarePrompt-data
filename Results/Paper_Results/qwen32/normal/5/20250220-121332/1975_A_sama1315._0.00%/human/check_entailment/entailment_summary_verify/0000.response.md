### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a significant flaw in the provided code. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted or if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements that are out of order. This is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted using the allowed operation of splitting the array into a prefix and suffix and swapping them.

The problem requires checking if the array can be sorted by potentially performing multiple such operations. The key insight is that the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order if there exists a point in the array where the sequence can be split such that the suffix is less than or equal to the prefix when swapped. This means the array should be a concatenation of two sorted subarrays where the last element of the first subarray is less than or equal to the first element of the second subarray.

Let's analyze the code and the function summaries:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if the array is already sorted. If it is, it returns "Yes". If there is at least one pair of adjacent elements out of order, it returns "No". This is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by the described operation.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results. Given the flaw in `func_1`, this function will not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the described operation.

To correctly solve the problem, `func_1` should be modified to check if there exists a valid split point in the array such that the array can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order by swapping the prefix and suffix. Here is a possible correct implementation of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Check if the array is already sorted
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)):
        return 'Yes'
    
    # Try to find a valid split point
    for i in range(n):
        # Check if arr[i:] + arr[:i] is sorted
        if all(arr[j] <= arr[j + 1] for j in range(n - 1)):
            return 'Yes'
        # Rotate the array to the right by one position
        arr = [arr[-1]] + arr[:-1]
    
    return 'No'
```

However, the provided code does not implement this logic. Therefore, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
