To determine the output of the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables involved.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial State Breakdown:**
   - `data`: A list of strings.
   - `t`: An integer value such that `t >= 1`.
   - `n`: The integer value of `data[1 + (t-1) * (n + 1)]`.
   - `arr`: A list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index `1 + t * (n + 1)` to `1 + t * (n + 1) + n`.
   - `index`: The value `1 + t * (n + 1) + n`.
   - `results`: A list containing the values of `result` (previously appended) and the new `result` from `func_1(arr)` for all `t` iterations.
   - `result`: The value returned by `func_1(arr)` for the last iteration.

2. **Key Points:**
   - `arr` is dynamically sliced from `data` based on the value of `t` and `n`.
   - `n` is derived from `data` based on the position `1 + (t-1) * (n + 1)`.
   - `results` is a list that accumulates the results of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration.
   - The final `print` statement joins all elements in the `results` list with newline characters (`\n`).

3. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `results` is a list of values returned by `func_1(arr)` for each iteration, the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will print each of these values on a new line.

### Final Output:

Output: **result_1\nresult_2\n...\nresult_t (where result_i is the value returned by func_1(arr) for the i-th iteration)**

This output indicates that each line in the printed result corresponds to the value returned by `func_1(arr)` for each iteration from `1` to `t`.
