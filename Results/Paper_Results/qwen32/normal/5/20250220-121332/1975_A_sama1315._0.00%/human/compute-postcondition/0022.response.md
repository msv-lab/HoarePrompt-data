Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index `3 + n` to `3 + 2n`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 2n + 1`; `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 1; `results` is a list containing the values of `result` (previously appended) and the new `result` from `func_1(arr)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**

In this output state, `index` has been incremented by 1, making it `3 + 2n + 1`. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
