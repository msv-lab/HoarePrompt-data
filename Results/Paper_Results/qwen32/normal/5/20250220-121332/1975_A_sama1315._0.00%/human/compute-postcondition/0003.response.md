The code snippet assigns the integer value of the element at index `0` of the `data` list to the variable `t`. This does not affect the values of `arr`, `data`, or `index`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with length `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element in `arr` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `index` is 0; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**
