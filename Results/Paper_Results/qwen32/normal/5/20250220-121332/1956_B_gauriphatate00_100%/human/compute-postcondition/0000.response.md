The code snippet initializes an empty dictionary `count_a`. This dictionary is intended to be used to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. The list `a` and the integer `n` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `count_a` is an empty dictionary.**
