The code snippet increments the count of `num` in the dictionary `count_a`. If `num` is already a key in `count_a`, its value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `num` is added to `count_a` with a value of 1.

Given that `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, and `count_a` is a dictionary that keeps track of the count of each number in `a`, the execution of `count_a[num] += 1` will update the count of `num` in `count_a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `count_a` is a dictionary where the count of `num` has been incremented by 1.**
