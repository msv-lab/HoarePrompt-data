Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. The function `func_1` only counts the number of pairs of cards you have, but it does not consider the optimal moves by Nene, which is a crucial part of the problem.

Let's analyze the logic with an example:

**Example:**
```
Input:
2
4
1 1 2 3
8
7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

Expected Output:
1
2
```

**Explanation of the first test case:**
- You have cards: 1, 1, 2, 3
- Nene has cards: 2, 3, 4, 4
- Optimal play:
  1. You play 1 (no point, table: [1])
  2. Nene plays 4 (no point, table: [1, 4])
  3. You play 1 (1 point, table: [1, 4, 1])
  4. Nene plays 4 (1 point, table: [1, 4, 1, 4])
  5. You play 2 (no point, table: [1, 4, 1, 4, 2])
  6. Nene plays 2 (1 point, table: [1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 2])
  7. You play 3 (no point, table: [1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 2, 3])
  8. Nene plays 3 (1 point, table: [1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 2, 3, 3])
- You score 1 point, Nene scores 3 points.

**Explanation of the second test case:**
- You have cards: 7, 4, 1, 2, 8, 8, 5, 5
- Nene has cards: 7, 4, 1, 2, 8, 8, 5, 5 (assuming the remaining cards are distributed equally)
- Optimal play:
  1. You play 7 (no point, table: [7])
  2. Nene plays 7 (1 point, table: [7, 7])
  3. You play 4 (no point, table: [7, 7, 4])
  4. Nene plays 4 (1 point, table: [7, 7, 4, 4])
  5. You play 1 (no point, table: [7, 7, 4, 4, 1])
  6. Nene plays 1 (1 point, table: [7, 7, 4, 4, 1, 1])
  7. You play 2 (no point, table: [7, 7, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2])
  8. Nene plays 2 (1 point, table: [7, 7, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2])
  9. You play 8 (no point, table: [7, 7, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8])
  10. Nene plays 8 (1 point, table: [7, 7, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 8])
  11. You play 8 (1 point, table: [7, 7, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8])
  12. Nene plays 8 (1 point, table: [7, 7, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8])
  13. You play 5 (no point, table: [7, 7, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5])
  14. Nene plays 5 (1 point, table: [7, 7, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5])
  15. You play 5 (1 point, table: [7, 7, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5])
  16. Nene plays 5 (1 point, table: [7, 7, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5])
- You score 2 points, Nene scores 6 points.

The provided code does not simulate the optimal play by Nene and does not account for the strategy that minimizes your score while maximizing hers. Therefore, it is incorrect.
