Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. The program simply counts the number of pairs of cards you have and returns that count as your score. However, this does not account for Nene's optimal play, which can affect your score.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to consider the strategy that Nene will use to maximize her score while minimizing yours. This involves keeping track of which cards are on the table and making decisions based on that information. The current implementation does not simulate the turns or consider the interactions between your moves and Nene's moves.

Here's a brief outline of what a correct approach might involve:
1. Track the number of each card you and Nene have.
2. Simulate the turns, considering Nene's optimal strategy.
3. Keep track of which cards are on the table and update scores accordingly.

The provided code does not implement this logic, so it is incorrect for the problem as described.
