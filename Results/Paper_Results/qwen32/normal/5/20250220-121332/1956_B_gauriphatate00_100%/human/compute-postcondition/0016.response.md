The given code snippet initializes a variable `max_score` to 0. This action does not affect the existing variables `a`, `n`, or `count_a`. Therefore, the value of `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `count_a` remains a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `max_score` is 0.**
