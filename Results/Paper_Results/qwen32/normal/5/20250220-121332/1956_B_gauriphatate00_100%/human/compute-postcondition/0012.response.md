The code snippet `count_a[num] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `num` in the dictionary `count_a` by 1. If `num` was not already a key in `count_a`, it will be added with an initial value of 1, and then incremented to 2.

Given the initial state, `count_a` is a dictionary that tracks the count of each integer in the list `a`. After executing `count_a[num] += 1`, the count of `num` in `count_a` will be increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `count_a` is a dictionary where the count of `num` has been incremented by 1.**
