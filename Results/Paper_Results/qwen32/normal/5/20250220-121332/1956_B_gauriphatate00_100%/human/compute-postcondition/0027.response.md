The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n` (inclusive), so for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `num` has just been incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `num` should be the next integer in the range.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. If `num` is in `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is equal to 2, `max_score` is set to 2. Otherwise, `max_score` remains 1. `num` is incremented by 1.**

Since `num` has been incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `num` will be the next integer in the sequence from `1` to `n`.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. If `num` is in `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is equal to 2, `max_score` is set to 2. Otherwise, `max_score` remains 1. `num` is the next integer in the range from 1 to n.**

To be more specific, if `num` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `num` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. If `num` is in `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is equal to 2, `max_score` is set to 2. Otherwise, `max_score` remains 1. `num` is incremented by 1.**

Since `num` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we simply need to reflect that `num` is now the next integer in the sequence.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. If `num` is in `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is equal to 2, `max_score` is set to 2. Otherwise, `max_score` remains 1. `num` is incremented by 1.**

To clearly indicate the next state:

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. If `num` is in `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is equal to 2, `max_score` is set to 2. Otherwise, `max_score` remains 1. `num` is the next integer in the range from 1 to n.**

Since `num` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we simply need to reflect that `num` is now the next integer in the sequence.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. If `num` is in `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is equal to 2, `max_score` is set to 2. Otherwise, `max_score` remains 1. `num` is incremented by 1.**

More specifically:

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. If `num` is in `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is equal to 2, `max_score` is set to 2. Otherwise, `max_score` remains 1. `num` is the next integer in the range from 1 to n.**

Given that `num` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `num` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. If `num` is in `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is equal to 2, `max_score` is set to 2. Otherwise, `max_score` remains 1. `num` is incremented by 1.**

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. If `num` is in `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is equal to 2, `max_score` is set to 2. Otherwise, `max_score` remains 1. `num` is incremented by 1.**

More specifically, if `num` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `num` will be `k + 1`.
