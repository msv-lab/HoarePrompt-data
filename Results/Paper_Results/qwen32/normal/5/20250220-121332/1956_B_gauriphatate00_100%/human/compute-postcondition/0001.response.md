The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which is an iterator over the list `a`. To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that the list `a` is not empty. The state of `count_a` and the values within the list `a` do not affect whether the loop can execute; they only affect what happens inside the loop body.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `a` contains at least one integer.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `count_a` is an empty dictionary, and `a` must have at least one integer**
