Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each of the t test cases, there are four lines of input, each containing two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. These coordinates represent the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. `t` is assigned the value of the integer input.**

In simple terms, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input, representing the number of test cases. All other conditions regarding the test cases remain the same.
