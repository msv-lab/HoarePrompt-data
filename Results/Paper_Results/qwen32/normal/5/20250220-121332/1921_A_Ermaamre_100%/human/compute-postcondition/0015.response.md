Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 99\).
- `a` is a new 4xN list of integers read from the input. This means `a` is a list containing 4 sublists, each of which has N integers.
- `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the 4 sublists in `a`. So, `x` will be a list of 4 integers.
- `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print(dx * dx)
```

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**
1. **Determine the value of `x`:**
   - `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the 4 sublists in `a`. 
   - If `a` is structured as follows:
     ```python
     a = [
         [a11, a12, ..., a1N],
         [a21, a22, ..., a2N],
         [a31, a32, ..., a3N],
         [a41, a42, ..., a4N]
     ]
     ```
   - Then `x` will be:
     ```python
     x = [a11, a21, a31, a41]
     ```

2. **Determine the value of `dx`:**
   - `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.
   - Mathematically, `dx = max(x) - min(x)`.

3. **Determine the value of `dx * dx`:**
   - `dx * dx` is the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

Since the exact values of the elements in `a` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `dx`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the values in `x`.

**Output Description:**
The `print(dx * dx)` statement will print the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

Output: **dx * dx (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`)**
