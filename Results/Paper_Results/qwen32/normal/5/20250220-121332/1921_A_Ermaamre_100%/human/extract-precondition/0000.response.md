Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each of the t test cases, there are four lines of input, each containing two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. These coordinates represent the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**
