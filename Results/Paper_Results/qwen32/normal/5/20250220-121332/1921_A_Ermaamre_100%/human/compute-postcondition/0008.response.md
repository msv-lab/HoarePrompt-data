The code snippet provided is:

```python
x = [p[0] for p in a]
```

This line of code reassigns the variable `x` to be a new list containing the first element of each sublist in the list `a`. The initial state tells us that `x` already contains the first element of each sublist in the original `a`, so this operation does not change the values of `x`. The variables `t`, `a`, and `dx` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` is a new 4xN list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the N sublists in the original `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `x`.**
