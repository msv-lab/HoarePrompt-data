The code calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list `x`, which contains the first element of each of the N sublists in `a`. This difference is stored in the variable `dx`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` is a 4xN list of integers; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the N sublists in `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `x`.**
