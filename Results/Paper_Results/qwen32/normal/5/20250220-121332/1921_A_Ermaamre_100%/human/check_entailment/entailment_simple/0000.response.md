### Reasoning:

The program is designed to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The key steps in the program are:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the coordinates of the four corners are read into a list `a`.

2. **Extracting X-Coordinates:**
   - The x-coordinates of the corners are extracted into a list `x`.

3. **Calculating Side Length:**
   - The side length of the square is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`).

4. **Calculating and Printing Area:**
   - The area of the square is calculated as `dx * dx` and printed.

### Analysis:

- **Assumption of Square Properties:**
  - The problem guarantees that the input coordinates form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. This means that the side length can be determined by the difference in either the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates, as the square's sides are aligned with the axes.

- **Correctness of Calculation:**
  - Since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) will give the side length of the square.
  - The area of the square is correctly calculated as the square of the side length (`dx * dx`).

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by repeating the process for each set of four coordinates.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem description and the provided program, the program correctly calculates the area of the square for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
