The code snippet creates a new list `x` by taking the first element of each sublist in the list `a`. 

Given that `a` is a 4xN list, `x` will be a list containing the first element of each of the N sublists in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` is a 4xN list of integers; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the N sublists in `a`.**
