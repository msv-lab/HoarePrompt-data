The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` was 2, so after the increment, `i` becomes 3. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, and the condition related to `l[2]` and `l[3]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 3. If `l[2]` equals 4 and `l[3]` equals 3, then `j` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged.**
