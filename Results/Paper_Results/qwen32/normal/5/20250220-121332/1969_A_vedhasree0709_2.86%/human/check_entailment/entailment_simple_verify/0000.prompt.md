You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i <= n - 1:
            if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        if j == 0:
            print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        i = 0
        
        j = 0
        
        while i <= n - 1:
            if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        
        if j == 0:
            print(3)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; n is the input integer; l is the list of integers read from the input; i is n; j is 0 indicating that no pair (l[i], l[i + 1]) matches (i + 2, i + 1) during all iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. The program seems to be checking for a very specific pattern in the list, where it expects pairs of friends to be in a consecutive order with a difference of 1, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

Let's consider a few test cases to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

1. **Test Case:**
   ```
   3
   5
   3 1 2 5 4
   4
   2 3 4 1
   2
   2 1
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   2
   3
   2
   ```
   **Actual Output:**
   ```
   2
   3
   2
   ```
   This test case seems to work, but it's not enough to verify the correctness of the program.

2. **Test Case:**
   ```
   1
   5
   2 3 4 5 1
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   2
   ```
   **Actual Output:**
   ```
   3
   ```
   Here, the program outputs 3, but the correct answer is 2. Monocarp can invite friends 1 and 2, and both will come to the party because 1's best friend is 2 and 2's best friend is 3, but 2 is invited, so both 1 and 2 will come.

3. **Test Case:**
   ```
   1
   4
   2 4 1 3
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   2
   ```
   **Actual Output:**
   ```
   3
   ```
   Here, the program outputs 3, but the correct answer is 2. Monocarp can invite friends 1 and 2, and both will come to the party because 1's best friend is 2 and 2's best friend is 4, but 2 is invited, so both 1 and 2 will come.

The program only checks for a specific pattern (consecutive pairs with a difference of 1) and does not handle all possible cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
