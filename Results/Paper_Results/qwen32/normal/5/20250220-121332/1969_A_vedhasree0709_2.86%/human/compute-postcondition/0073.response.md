Postcondition: **`t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` must be at least 2, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1 if `l[0]` is 2 and `l[1]` is 1, otherwise `j` remains 0. If `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
