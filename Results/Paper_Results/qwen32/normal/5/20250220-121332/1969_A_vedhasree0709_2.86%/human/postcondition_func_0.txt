The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists a pair of consecutive elements in the list that match the pattern (i+2, i+1). If such a pair is found, it outputs `2`; otherwise, it outputs `3`.
