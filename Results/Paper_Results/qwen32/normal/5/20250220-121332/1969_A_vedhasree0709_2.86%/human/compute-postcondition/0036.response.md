The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `j`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; the current value of `l[i]` is `i + 2` and the current value of `l[i + 1]` is `i + 1`.**
