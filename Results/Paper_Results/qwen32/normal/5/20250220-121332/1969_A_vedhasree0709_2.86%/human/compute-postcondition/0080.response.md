The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was 2, so now `i` is 3. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, and `j`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` must be at least 3, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `i` is 3, and `j` is 1 if `l[2] == 4` and `l[3] == 3`, otherwise `j` remains 0.**
