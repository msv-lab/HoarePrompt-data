#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins. The second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is `t-1`; `results` is a list containing `t` strings, each either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in each corresponding `arr` is odd or even; `n` is the integer input from the user for the last test case; `arr` is the string input from the user for the last test case.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: the loop has printed all elements of the `results` list, and `i` is the last element of the `results` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a string of 'U' and 'D' characters representing coins facing up or down. It checks if the count of 'U' characters in each string is odd. For each test case, it outputs 'yes' if the count of 'U' is odd, otherwise 'no'.
