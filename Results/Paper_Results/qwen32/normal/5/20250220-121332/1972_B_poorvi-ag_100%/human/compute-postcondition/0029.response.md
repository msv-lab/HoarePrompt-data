To determine the final output state after the loop completes all iterations, let's analyze the loop and the given conditions.

The loop is:
```python
for i in results:
    print(i)
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- `i` is initialized to `t-1`.
- `results` is a list of `t` strings, each 'yes' or 'no'.
- `n` is the integer input for the last test case.
- `arr` is the string input for the last test case.

The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list and prints it. The loop will execute exactly `t` times, once for each element in `results`.

After all iterations:
- The variable `i` will be the last element of the `results` list, as it is updated in each iteration to the current element being processed.
- The `results` list will remain unchanged.
- The variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` will also remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the final output state is:
- The loop will have printed all elements of the `results` list.
- The variable `i` will hold the last element of the `results` list.

Output State: **the loop has printed all elements of the `results` list, and `i` is the last element of the `results` list.**
