The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements in the `results` list. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `results` list. If the `results` list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third element.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least 2 strings, each either 'yes' or 'no', and `i` is the second element of the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` will be the third element of the `results` list.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least 3 strings, each either 'yes' or 'no', `i` is the third element of the `results` list**
