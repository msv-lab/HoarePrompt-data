Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 1; `results` is a list containing either the string 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even, and now includes an additional 'no'; `n` is the integer input from the user; `arr` is the string input from the user.**

Explanation: The `results` list has been updated to include an additional string 'no'. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
