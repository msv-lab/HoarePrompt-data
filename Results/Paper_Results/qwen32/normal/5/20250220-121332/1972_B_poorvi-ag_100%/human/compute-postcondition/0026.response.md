Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We know that `results` is a list containing at least 2 strings, each of which is either 'yes' or 'no'. Additionally, `i` is defined as the second element of the `results` list.

2. **Variable `i`**: Since `i` is assigned the value of the second element of the `results` list, we can denote this as `results[1]`. The value of `results[1]` can be either 'yes' or 'no' based on the precondition.

3. **Print Statement**: The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is `results[1]`.

Since the exact values of the elements in `results` are not specified, we can only determine that `i` will be either 'yes' or 'no'.

Therefore, the output of the `print(i)` statement will be either 'yes' or 'no', depending on the specific values in the `results` list.

Output: **i (where i is the second element of the results list, and i can be either 'yes' or 'no')**
