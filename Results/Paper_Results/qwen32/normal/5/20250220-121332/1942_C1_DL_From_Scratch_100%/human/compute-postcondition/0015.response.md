The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is the number of iterations the loop is supposed to run.

State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `y` is the third integer read from the input, The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `list0` is a list containing `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` sorted in ascending order; `i` is 2; `num` is `list0[2] - list0[1] - 1`. If `num` equals 1, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1.**
