The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. Given the initial state, only `n`, `x`, and `y` will be affected by this code. The values of `T` and the list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` are not affected by this particular code snippet.

Here's the output state:

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is the second integer read from the input, `y` is the third integer read from the input, The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
