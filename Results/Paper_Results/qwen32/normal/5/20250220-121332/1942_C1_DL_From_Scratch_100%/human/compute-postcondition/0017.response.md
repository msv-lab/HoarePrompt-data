Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `y` is the third integer read from the input, The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `list0` is a list containing `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` sorted in ascending order; `i` is 2; `num` is `list0[3] - list0[2] - 1`. If `num` equals 1, then `count` is 3. Otherwise, `count` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values as given in the initial state.
