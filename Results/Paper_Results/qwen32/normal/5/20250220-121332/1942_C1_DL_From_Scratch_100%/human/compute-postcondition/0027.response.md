The provided code snippet reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to `list0`. This operation does not affect the values of `T`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `i`, `count`, or `num`. The only change is that `list0` is now assigned the new list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input; `x` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 2; `y` is the third integer read from the input; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `list0` is a list containing `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` sorted in ascending order as read from the input; `i` is `x - 1`; `count` is the total number of times `num` equals 1, plus 1 if the current value of `num` is 1; `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`. If `num` equals 1, `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.**
