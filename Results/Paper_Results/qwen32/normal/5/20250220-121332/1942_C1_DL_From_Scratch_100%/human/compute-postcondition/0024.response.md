To determine the output of the print statement `print(count + x - 2)`, we need to break down the information given in the initial state and understand how the variables are defined and calculated.

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4 (number of test cases).
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input (number of vertices).
   - `x` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 2 (number of chosen vertices).
   - `y` is the third integer read from the input (not used in this calculation).
   - `list0` is a list containing `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` sorted in ascending order (chosen vertices).
   - `i` is `x - 1` (index of the last element in `list0`).
   - `num` is calculated as `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`.
   - `count` is incremented by 1 if `num` equals 1, otherwise it remains unchanged.
   - `count` is also incremented by the total number of times `num` equals 1 in the context of the problem, but since `num` is calculated only once here, `count` is either 0 or 1 based on whether `num` is 1.

2. **Calculation of `num`:**
   - `num` is defined as `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`.
   - Since `list0` is sorted in ascending order, `list0[0]` is the smallest element and `list0[-1]` is the largest element in `list0`.
   - `num` will be equal to 1 if `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1 == 1`.
   - Simplifying, `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] == 2`.

3. **Calculation of `count`:**
   - `count` is initially 0.
   - `count` is incremented by 1 if `num` equals 1.

4. **Final Expression:**
   - The print statement is `print(count + x - 2)`.
   - `count` is either 0 or 1.
   - Therefore, the expression evaluates to either `x - 2` if `num` is not 1, or `x - 1` if `num` is 1.

Given the information, the output will depend on whether `num` equals 1 or not. However, since we do not have the exact values of `list0`, `n`, and `x`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `num`. Thus, we describe the output in terms of the conditions given.

Output: **count + x - 2 (where count is 1 if num equals 1, otherwise count is 0, and num is calculated as list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1)**
