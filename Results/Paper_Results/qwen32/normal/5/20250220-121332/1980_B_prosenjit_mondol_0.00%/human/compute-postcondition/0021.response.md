Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `f` is an integer obtained from the input minus 2; `k` is an integer obtained from the input minus 3; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is `a[f]`.**

In this output state, the variable `x` has been assigned the value of the element at index `f` in the list `a`. All other variables retain their previously defined states.
