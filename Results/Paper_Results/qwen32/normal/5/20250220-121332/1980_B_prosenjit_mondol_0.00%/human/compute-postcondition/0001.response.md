The code snippet assigns the values obtained from `input().split()` to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`. The `input().split()` function reads a line of input, splits it into three parts based on spaces, and then converts each part into an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The initial state of `t` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input.**
