Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `f` is an integer obtained from the input minus 2; `k` is an integer obtained from the input minus 3; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `x` is `a[f]`. If `a[k]` is less than `x`, the condition is true, otherwise, the condition is false. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.**
