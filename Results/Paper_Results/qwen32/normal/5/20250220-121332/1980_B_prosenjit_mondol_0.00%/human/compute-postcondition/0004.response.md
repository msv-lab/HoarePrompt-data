The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `f` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1; `k` is an integer obtained from the input minus 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
