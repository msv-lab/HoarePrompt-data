The code `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Given the initial state, if `x` is equal to 1, `big` already contains `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty. If `x` is not equal to 1, `big` is initially an empty list. After appending `a` to `big`, `big` will definitely contain `a`.

Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is `iterable2 + 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 2`, `num` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `big` is a list containing `a`, `less` and `no` are empty lists if `x` was not 1; `big` contains `a` twice, `less` and `no` are empty lists if `x` was 1.**
