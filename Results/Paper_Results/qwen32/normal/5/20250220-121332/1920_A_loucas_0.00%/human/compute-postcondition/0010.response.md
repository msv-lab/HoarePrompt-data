The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `a` is the second integer from the input, `big` will now contain this integer as its first element. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing the second integer from input, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is 1, `a` is the second integer from input.**
