Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 2`, `num` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `big` is a list containing the second integer from the new input, `less` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, otherwise `no` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to 2.**

In simpler terms, the list `big` now contains the second integer from the new input. The lists `less` and `no` remain unchanged unless `x` was not 1 or 2, in which case `no` would have already contained `a` before this operation.
