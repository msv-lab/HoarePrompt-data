Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is the user input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 2`, `big` is a list containing at least one element, `less` is a list containing at least one element greater than the maximum element in `big`, `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `i` is `max(big)`, `num` is `max(big)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of all the variables remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
