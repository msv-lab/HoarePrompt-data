Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is equal to the number of iterations, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `big` is a list containing at least one element (e.g., `[1]`), `less` is a list containing at least one element with a value greater than the maximum value in `big` (e.g., `[2]`), `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, and `i` is not in `no`**
