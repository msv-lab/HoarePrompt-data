The code snippet `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Given the initial state, `big` is a list containing the value of `a` twice if `x` is 1. After appending `a` again, `big` will contain the value of `a` three times if `x` is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 1, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is 1, `iterable` is the previous value of `innerLoop + 1`, `x` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `big` is a list containing the value of `a` three times if `x` is 1, `less` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 2, `no` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is not 1 or 2.**
