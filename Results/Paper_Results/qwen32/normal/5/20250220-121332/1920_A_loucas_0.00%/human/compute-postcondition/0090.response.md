The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to a new variable `num`. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the value of `num` will be `i + 2` since `i` was previously `i + 2`.

Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 1`, `big` is a non-empty list of values where `x` was 1, `less` is a non-empty list of values where `x` was 2, `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `num` is `i + 2`**.
