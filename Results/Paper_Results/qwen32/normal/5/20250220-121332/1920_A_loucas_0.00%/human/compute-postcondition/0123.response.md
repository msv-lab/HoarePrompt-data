The code snippet `no.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. This means that regardless of the initial state of `no` (which could be an empty list or contain elements based on the value of `x`), `a` will be added to `no`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is `iterable2 + 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 2`, `num` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `no` is a list containing `a`, and `big` and `less` are empty lists.**

In natural language: The variable `no` now contains the value of `a`, and `big` and `less` remain empty lists. All other variables retain their initial values.
