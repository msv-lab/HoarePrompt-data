Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `x` is the first integer from input, `a` is the second integer from input, `x` is not equal to 1. If `x` is 2, `less` contains the value of `a` and `big` and `no` are empty lists. Otherwise, `less` and `big` are empty lists and `no` contains the value of `a`.**
