Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is 0, `iterable` is the previous value of `innerLoop + 1`, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `big` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 1, an empty list if `x` is 2, and an empty list if `x` is not 1 or 2, `less` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 1 or 2, and an empty list if `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is not 1 or 2, and an empty list if `x` is 1 or 2.**
