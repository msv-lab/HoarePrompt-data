Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is equal to the previous value of `innerLoop`, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `iterable` is the previous value of `innerLoop + 1`, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer.**

Here, `x` and `a` are assigned the values of the two integers provided by the user input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
