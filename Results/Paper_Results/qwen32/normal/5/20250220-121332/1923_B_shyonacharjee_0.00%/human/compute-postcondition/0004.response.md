Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that `t` is at least 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `healths` is a list of integers derived from the next input line; `positions` is a list of integers derived from the latest input line.**

Explanation: The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `positions`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `healths` remain unchanged.
