The given code snippet simply initializes a new variable `total_bullets_used` to 0. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the initial state remains largely intact except for the addition of `total_bullets_used`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `n` and `k` are integers from the input; `healths` and `positions` are lists from the input; `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions; `total_bullets_used` is 0.**
