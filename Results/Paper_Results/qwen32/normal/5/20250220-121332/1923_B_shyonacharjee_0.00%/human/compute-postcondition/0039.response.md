Output State: **`t` is at least 1 and is decremented by 1; `n` and `k` are integers from the input; `healths` and `positions` are lists from the input; `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions; `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of the monsters processed; `success` is True if all monsters were processed without exceeding the time available, otherwise False.**

Explanation: The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
