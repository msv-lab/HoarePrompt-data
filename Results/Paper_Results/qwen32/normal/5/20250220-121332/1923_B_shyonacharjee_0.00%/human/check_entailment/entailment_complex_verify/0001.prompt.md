You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

    #State: `t` is 0; `n` and `k` are the last input integers; `healths` is the last list of integers read from the input; `positions` is the last list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a position and a health value, sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all monsters if `success` is `True`; `success` is `True` if `total_bullets_used` never exceeded `time_available` for any monster; otherwise, `success` is `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters within the constraints given. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k`, a list `a` of `n` integers representing the health of monsters, and a list `x` of `n` integers representing the positions of the monsters. The function outputs 'YES' if it is possible to defeat all monsters using the bullets within the time constraints, otherwise it outputs 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to determine whether the player can kill all monsters before they reach the character. Let's break down the steps to see if the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads:
     - `n` (number of monsters) and `k` (maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second).
     - `healths` (list of health values for each monster).
     - `positions` (list of positions for each monster).

2. **Sorting Monsters:**
   - The program pairs each monster's position with its health and sorts these pairs based on the absolute value of the position. This ensures that the monsters are processed in the order of their distance from the character, which is a logical approach to prioritize closer monsters.

3. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program then iterates through the sorted list of monsters.
   - For each monster, it calculates the distance from the character (`distance = abs(position)`) and the time available to kill the monster (`time_available = distance`).
   - It also calculates the number of bullets needed to kill the monster (`bullets_needed = health`).
   - It checks if the total number of bullets used so far plus the bullets needed for the current monster exceeds the time available. If it does, the program sets `success` to `False` and breaks out of the loop, indicating that it's not possible to kill all monsters before they reach the character.
   - If the loop completes without setting `success` to `False`, the program outputs "YES".

### Issues:
- The program does not consider the constraint on the number of bullets per second (`k`). It assumes that an unlimited number of bullets can be fired per second, which is not the case according to the problem description. The correct approach should account for the fact that no more than `k` bullets can be fired per second.
- Due to this oversight, the program may incorrectly determine that it's possible to kill all monsters when, in fact, the number of bullets fired per second exceeds the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the constraint on the number of bullets that can be fired per second.

**Correctness: False**
