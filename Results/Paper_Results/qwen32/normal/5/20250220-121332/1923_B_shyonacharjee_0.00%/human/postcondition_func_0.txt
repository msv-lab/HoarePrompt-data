The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters within the constraints given. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k`, a list `a` of `n` integers representing the health of monsters, and a list `x` of `n` integers representing the positions of the monsters. The function outputs 'YES' if it is possible to defeat all monsters using the bullets within the time constraints, otherwise it outputs 'NO'.
