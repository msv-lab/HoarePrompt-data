Output State: **`t` is at least 1 and is decremented by 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is an integer from the input; `healths` is a list of integers from the new input; `positions` is a list of integers from the new input; `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions; `total_bullets_used` is 0; `success` is True; `position` is the position value from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `health` is the health value from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `distance` is `abs(position)`; `time_available` is `abs(position)`; `bullets_needed` is `health`.**

In this output state, the variable `bullets_needed` has been assigned the value of `health`, which is the health value from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state.
