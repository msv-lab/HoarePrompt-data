The only variable in the loop head is `char`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression` string. Since the loop iterates over each character in the `expression` string, at the start of the next iteration, `char` will be the next character in the `expression` string.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" with at least one character.
- `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`.
- `char` is the next character in the `expression` string.
- If `balance` was less than 0, `count` is incremented by 1 and `balance` is set to 0. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged and `balance` retains its original value.

To proceed to the next iteration, `char` should be the next character in the `expression` string. Since the loop iterates over each character in the string, `char` will naturally be the next character in the sequence.

State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" with at least one character, `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `char` is the next character in the `expression` string.** 

Since `char` is the loop variable, it will be automatically assigned the next character in the `expression` string as the loop progresses. The other variables (`length`, `count`, `balance`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
