The code snippet `balance -= 1` decreases the value of `balance` by 1. The values of the other variables (`expression`, `length`, `count`, and `char`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" with at least one character, `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`. If `balance` is less than 0, then `count` is 1 and `balance` is 0. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 and `balance` retains its original value minus 1 (either 0 if the last character was '+' and the previous `balance` was 1, or -2 if the last character was '-' and the previous `balance` was -1). `char` is the next character in the `expression` string.**
