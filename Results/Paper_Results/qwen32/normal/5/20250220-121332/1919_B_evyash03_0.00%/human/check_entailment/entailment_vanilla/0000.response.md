Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly computes the minimum penalty as described in the problem statement.

### Problem Understanding

The problem requires us to split the array `a` derived from the string `s` into subarrays such that the sum of penalties for these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by the length of the subarray.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Splitting and Initial Calculation:**
   - The program splits the string `s` by the character `'-'` and calculates the sum of the lengths of the resulting parts. This step is not necessary for the optimal solution and seems to be an incorrect approach to solving the problem.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function iterates through the string `expression` to calculate a count and a balance.
   - It increments the count whenever the balance (which tracks the sum of the subarray) becomes negative, resetting the balance to zero.
   - It adds an additional count if the balance is positive at the end of the iteration.

### Correctness Analysis

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. Here's why:

- **Incorrect Approach:** The program attempts to split the string `s` by `'-'` and uses the lengths of the resulting parts to calculate something, but this does not align with the problem's requirement of minimizing the total penalty by optimally splitting the array.
  
- **Flawed Penalty Calculation:** The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the penalty for each subarray. It simply counts transitions where the balance becomes negative and adds a final count if the balance is positive. This does not correspond to the penalty calculation as defined in the problem statement.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, one should:
- Use dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal way to split the array.
- Calculate the penalty for each potential split and choose the one that minimizes the total penalty.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect for solving the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
