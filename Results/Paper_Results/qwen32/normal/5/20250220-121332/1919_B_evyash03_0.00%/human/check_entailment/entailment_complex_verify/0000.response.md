### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
1. **Input:** A string `s` consisting of '+' and '-'.
2. **Conversion:** Convert `s` to an array `a` where each '+' becomes `1` and each '-' becomes `-1`.
3. **Objective:** Split `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that their concatenation equals `a`. The goal is to minimize the total penalty, where the penalty of a subarray `c` is `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy to minimize the penalty. Let's break down the reasoning based on the annotated code:

1. **Splitting Logic:**
   ```python
   parts = expression.split('-')
   result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))
   ```
   This logic splits the string by '-' and sums the lengths of the resulting parts. This is not a valid way to determine the optimal splits for minimizing the penalty. It simply counts the lengths of segments separated by '-', which does not consider the values in between or the optimal subarray splits.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(expression, length):
       count = 0
       balance = 0
       for char in expression:
           if char == '+':
               balance += 1
           elif char == '-':
               balance -= 1
           if balance < 0:
               count += 1
               balance = 0
       return count + (balance > 0)
   ```
   - **Purpose:** The function counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the final balance is positive.
   - **Issue:** This does not align with the penalty calculation described in the problem. The function does not actually calculate the penalty for each subarray. Instead, it counts transitions where the balance goes negative, which is not the correct approach for minimizing the penalty.

#### Counterexample:
Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- **Input:** `+-++-`
- **Expected Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:** The optimal split is `([+,-],[+],[+],[-])` with penalties:
  - `p([+,-]) = 0`
  - `p([+]) = 1`
  - `p([+]) = 1`
  - `p([-]) = 1`
  - **Total Penalty:** `0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`

The provided program does not handle this correctly. The function `func_1` does not compute the penalties as described but instead counts transitions where the balance goes negative, which is not the correct strategy.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` and the overall approach are flawed.

**Final:** **False**
