Postcondition: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" with at least one character, `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `char` is the next character in the `expression` string. If `balance` was less than 0, `count` is incremented by 1 and `balance` is set to 0. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged and `balance` retains its original value.**
