Postcondition: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" with at least one character, `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`. If `char` is '-', then if `balance` is less than 0, `count` is 1 and `balance` is 0. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 and `balance` is decreased by 1. If `char` is not '-', `count` remains 0 and `balance` retains its original value. `char` is the next character in the `expression` string.**
