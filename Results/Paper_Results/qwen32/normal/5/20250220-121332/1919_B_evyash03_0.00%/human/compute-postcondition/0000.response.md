The code snippet initializes a variable `count` to 0. This does not affect the values of `expression` or `length`. The output state will reflect the initialization of `count` while keeping `expression` and `length` unchanged.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", and `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`; `count` is 0.**
