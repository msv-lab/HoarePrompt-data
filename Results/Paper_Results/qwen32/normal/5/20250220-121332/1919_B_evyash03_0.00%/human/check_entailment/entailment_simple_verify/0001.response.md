### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break it down further to ensure the reasoning is accurate and complete.

#### Problem Analysis Recap

The goal is to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the sum of the penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty of each subarray `c` is `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.

#### Key Observations Recap

1. **Subarrays with Zero Sum**: If a subarray has a sum of zero, its penalty is zero. Therefore, it's optimal to include such subarrays in the partition.
2. **Subarrays with Non-Zero Sum**: For subarrays with a non-zero sum, the penalty is the absolute value of the sum multiplied by the length of the subarray. To minimize the total penalty, we should try to keep these subarrays as short as possible.

#### Strategy Recap

- Traverse the array while maintaining a balance counter that increases with `+` and decreases with `-`.
- Whenever the balance becomes negative, it means that the subarray from the last reset point to the current point has a non-zero sum. We should reset the balance and count this subarray.
- At the end of the traversal, if the balance is positive, it indicates that there is an unprocessed subarray with a positive sum.

#### Provided Program Analysis Recap

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `result_length`**: The variable `result_length` is calculated but not used in the function `func_1`. This variable seems to be an attempt to count non-empty parts of the string when split by `-`, but it's not relevant to the optimal penalty calculation.
2. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The function `func_1` only counts the number of subarrays with a negative balance and adds one if the final balance is positive. This does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty as described in the problem statement.

#### Annotations Analysis

The annotations provided in the code indicate:
- `expression` is a string consisting of characters `+` and `-`, and `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`.
- Inside `func_1`, `count` is the number of times the balance went negative, and `balance` is the final net balance after all resets.
- The function returns the number of times the balance went negative plus 1 if the final net balance is greater than 0, otherwise it returns just the number of times the balance went negative.

These annotations confirm that the function `func_1` is not calculating the minimum penalty correctly. It only counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds one if the final balance is positive, which does not align with the optimal strategy.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues and concluding that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
