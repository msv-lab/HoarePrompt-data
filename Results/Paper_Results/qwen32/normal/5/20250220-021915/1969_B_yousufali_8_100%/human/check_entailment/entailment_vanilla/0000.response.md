To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic behind the solution and see if it aligns with the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0's followed by all 1's) using the minimum cost of cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

### Solution Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function processes a single binary string.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

Let's break down the logic of `func_1()`:
- It initializes `n` to 0, which seems to count the number of '1's encountered so far.
- It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
- It iterates through each character in the string `s`:
  - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
  - If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0 (meaning we have encountered at least one '1' before this '0'), it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.

The key insight here is that whenever we encounter a '0' after some '1's, we need to move all the '1's encountered so far before this '0'. The cost of this operation is `n + 1` (where `n` is the number of '1's encountered before this '0'). This is because we can cyclically shift the substring that includes all the '1's and the current '0' to the right, effectively moving the '1's before the '0'.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's use the third example from the problem statement to illustrate:
- Input: `11000`
- Iteration:
  - `i = 0`: `s[0] = '1'`, `n = 1`, `ans = 0`
  - `i = 1`: `s[1] = '1'`, `n = 2`, `ans = 0`
  - `i = 2`: `s[2] = '0'`, `n = 2`, `ans = 0 + 2 + 1 = 3`
  - `i = 3`: `s[3] = '0'`, `n = 2`, `ans = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6`
  - `i = 4`: `s[4] = '0'`, `n = 2`, `ans = 6 + 2 + 1 = 9`

The total cost is 9, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion

The logic in the program correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string by counting the cost of moving '1's before each '0' encountered after some '1's. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
