The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The variable `s` remains a binary string with at least one character, and `i` is incremented by 1 as per the initial state description. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a binary string with at least one character, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`s` is a binary string with at least one character, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is incremented by 1**.
