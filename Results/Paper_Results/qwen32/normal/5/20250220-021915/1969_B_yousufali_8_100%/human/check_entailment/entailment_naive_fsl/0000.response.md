Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step and identify a potential issue:

The program uses the following logic:
1. It reads a binary string `s`.
2. It initializes `n` (count of '1's encountered so far) and `ans` (total cost) to 0.
3. It iterates through the string `s`.
   - If the current character is '1', it increments `n`.
   - If the current character is '0' and `n` (count of '1's encountered so far) is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.

The logic seems to assume that whenever a '0' is encountered after some '1's, the cost to move those '1's before the '0' is `n + 1`. However, this is not always the case. The cost to cyclically shift a substring `[l, r]` is `r - l + 1`, and the program does not correctly account for the optimal way to perform these shifts.

### Counterexample:

Consider the input string `11010`. The program will calculate the cost as follows:
- `s[0] = '1'`, `n = 1`
- `s[1] = '1'`, `n = 2`
- `s[2] = '0'`, `ans += 2 + 1 = 3` (because `n = 2`)
- `s[3] = '1'`, `n = 3`
- `s[4] = '0'`, `ans += 3 + 1 = 7` (because `n = 3`)

So, the program will output `7`, but the actual minimum cost to sort `11010` is `5` (by shifting `110` to `011` and then `11` to `11`).

### Optimal Strategy for the Counterexample:

1. Shift the substring `[0, 2]` (i.e., `110` to `011`), cost = `2 - 0 + 1 = 3`.
2. Shift the substring `[1, 3]` (i.e., `011` to `001`), cost = `3 - 1 + 1 = 3`.

Total cost = `3 + 2 = 5`.

Since the program does not correctly handle this case, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
