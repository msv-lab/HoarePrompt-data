You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's), and n is an integer initialized to 0, which counts the number of '1's encountered in the string s. ans is an integer initialized to 0, which accumulates the total cost to make the string sorted.
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: ans is 5, n is 1.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 5
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a binary string from the input, calculates the cost required to make the string sorted by counting the number of '1's encountered and adding to the cost whenever a '0' is encountered after a '1', and then prints the total cost.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. The function `func_2` does not take any parameters and operates based on input read from standard input.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `func_1()` is called `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from standard input, then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times. The overall effect is determined by the actions performed within `func_1`, which is not detailed here.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step and identify a potential issue:

The program uses the following logic:
1. It reads a binary string `s`.
2. It initializes `n` (count of '1's encountered so far) and `ans` (total cost) to 0.
3. It iterates through the string `s`.
   - If the current character is '1', it increments `n`.
   - If the current character is '0' and `n` (count of '1's encountered so far) is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.

The logic seems to assume that whenever a '0' is encountered after some '1's, the cost to move those '1's before the '0' is `n + 1`. However, this is not always the case. The cost to cyclically shift a substring `[l, r]` is `r - l + 1`, and the program does not correctly account for the optimal way to perform these shifts.

### Counterexample:

Consider the input string `11010`. The program will calculate the cost as follows:
- `s[0] = '1'`, `n = 1`
- `s[1] = '1'`, `n = 2`
- `s[2] = '0'`, `ans += 2 + 1 = 3` (because `n = 2`)
- `s[3] = '1'`, `n = 3`
- `s[4] = '0'`, `ans += 3 + 1 = 7` (because `n = 3`)

So, the program will output `7`, but the actual minimum cost to sort `11010` is `5` (by shifting `110` to `011` and then `11` to `11`).

### Optimal Strategy for the Counterexample:

1. Shift the substring `[0, 2]` (i.e., `110` to `011`), cost = `2 - 0 + 1 = 3`.
2. Shift the substring `[1, 3]` (i.e., `011` to `001`), cost = `3 - 1 + 1 = 3`.

Total cost = `3 + 2 = 5`.

Since the program does not correctly handle this case, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
