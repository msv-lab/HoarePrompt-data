The only variable in the loop head is `_` (a throwaway variable) and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0, and `_` is a throwaway variable that does not need to be adjusted.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` must have been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 after the decrement. This means that before the decrement, `t` must have been at least 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0** 

However, to be precise for the next iteration, `t` should be exactly 1 more than its current value (which is 0 after the last decrement for the loop to terminate). Hence, before the decrement, `t` must have been 1.

State: **`t` is 1**
