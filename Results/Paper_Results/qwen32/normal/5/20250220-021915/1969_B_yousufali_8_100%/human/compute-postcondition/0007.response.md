To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information:

- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is an input integer.
- The loop body contains the function call `func_1()`.

From the output states provided:
- After 1 iteration, `t` must be greater than 0.
- After 2 iterations, `t` must be 1.
- After 3 iterations, `t` must be 2.

Given these observations, we can infer that the loop will run exactly `t` times, and `t` must be the number of iterations specified.

If we consider the loop to run all its iterations, it will run `t` times. Therefore, the final output state will be dependent on the number of times `func_1()` is called, which is `t` times.

Since the problem specifies that the state of other variables not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged, and no specific changes to variables within the loop body are described, we can conclude that the only variable that changes is the number of times `func_1()` is executed.

Thus, the output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`func_1()` is called `t` times.**

In natural language, this means that the function `func_1()` will have been executed exactly `t` times when the loop finishes all its iterations.
