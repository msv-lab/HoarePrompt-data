Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It processes a binary string `s` and an integer `n` that counts the number of '1's encountered in `s`. It also uses an integer `ans` to accumulate the total cost required to make the string sorted. The function returns the accumulated cost `ans`.**
