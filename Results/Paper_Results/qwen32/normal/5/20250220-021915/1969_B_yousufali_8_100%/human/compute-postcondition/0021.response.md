The initial state provides us with the values of the variables `ans` and `n`. Specifically, `ans` is assigned the value 5 and `n` is assigned the value 1. The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(ans)`, which will output the value of the variable `ans`.

Since the value of `ans` is explicitly given as 5, the print statement will output the number 5.

Output: **5**
