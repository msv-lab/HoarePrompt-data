The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last string in the list `a` to the existing value of `first_row`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `a` is a list containing two string elements (the original user input and the new user input)
- `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a` (unchanged)
- `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a` (unchanged)
- `i` is incremented by 1

After executing the code:
- `first_row` is updated to be its original value concatenated with the first character of the second string in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list containing two string elements (the original user input and the new user input); `first_row` is the original `first_row` concatenated with the first character of the second string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a` (unchanged); `i` is incremented by 1.**
