The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so we need to adjust `i` and ensure `n` is greater than the new `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so it should now be `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list containing two string elements (the original user input and the new user input); `first_row` is the original `first_row` concatenated with the first character of the second string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the second string in `a` repeated twice; `i` is `i + 1`**
