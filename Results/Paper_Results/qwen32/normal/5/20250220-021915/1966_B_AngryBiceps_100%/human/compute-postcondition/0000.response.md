In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of an integer value derived from the input. The loop head only includes the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that will be converted to an integer and used in the `range` function.

The loop will execute if the integer value obtained from `int(input())` is greater than 0. Since the problem states that `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, the input should be adjusted to ensure that it falls within this range to guarantee that the loop will execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
