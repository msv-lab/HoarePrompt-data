To ensure that the `for` loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 because `range(n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `a` is an empty list
- `first_row` is an empty string
- `last_row` is an empty string

The only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `n`. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string**
