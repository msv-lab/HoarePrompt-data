Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is an empty list; `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in `a`; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in `a`.**

Explanation: The list `a` is reassigned to be an empty list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `first_row`, and `last_row`) remain unchanged. Since `a` is now an empty list, `first_row` and `last_row` will also be empty strings. The conditions for the if-else statement are not affected by this reassignment of `a`.
