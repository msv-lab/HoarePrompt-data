The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the second string in the list `a` to the variable `first_row`. 

Given the initial state, `first_row` is the first character of the first input string, and `a[-1][0]` is the first character of the second input string. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `first_row` will be the concatenation of the first character of the first input string and the first character of the second input string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first input string concatenated with the first character of the second input string, `last_row` is the last character of the first input string, `i` is `i + 1`.**
