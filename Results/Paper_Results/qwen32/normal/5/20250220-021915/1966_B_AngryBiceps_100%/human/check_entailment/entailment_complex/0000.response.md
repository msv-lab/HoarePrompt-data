### Reasoning:
The program aims to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations. The key observation here is that if the first row and the last row of the grid are both uniform in color and different from each other, or if the first column and the last column are both uniform in color and different from each other, then it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform in color.

The program correctly identifies these conditions and prints "NO" if either of them is met, otherwise it prints "YES". Let's break down the logic:

1. **First and Last Row Check**:
   - The program checks if all characters in the first row are the same (`len(set(a[0])) == 1`) and all characters in the last row are the same (`len(set(a[-1])) == 1`).
   - It then checks if these two rows are different (`a[0] != a[-1]`).
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "NO".

2. **First and Last Column Check**:
   - The program constructs strings `first_row` and `last_row` by concatenating the first and last characters of each row, respectively.
   - It checks if all characters in `first_row` are the same (`len(set(first_row)) == 1`) and all characters in `last_row` are the same (`len(set(last_row)) == 1`).
   - It then checks if these two columns are different (`first_row != last_row`).
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "NO".

3. **Otherwise**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "YES".

This logic aligns with the problem description and the example outputs provided. The program correctly identifies the scenarios where it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform in color and handles all other cases correctly.
