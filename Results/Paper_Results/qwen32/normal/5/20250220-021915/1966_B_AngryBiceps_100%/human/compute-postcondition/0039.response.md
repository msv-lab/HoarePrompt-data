The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the second string in the list `a` to the `last_row` variable. 

Given the initial state, `last_row` is initially set to the last character of the first input string. After executing the code, `last_row` will now be the concatenation of its initial value and the last character of the second input string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first input string concatenated with the first character of the second input string, `last_row` is the last character of the first input string concatenated with the last character of the second input string, `i` is `i + 1`.**
