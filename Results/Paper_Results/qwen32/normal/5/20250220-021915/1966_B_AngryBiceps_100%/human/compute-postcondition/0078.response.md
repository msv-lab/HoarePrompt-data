Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`: An integer greater than 0.
   - `m`: The second integer from the input.
   - `a`: A list containing `n` input strings.
   - `first_row`: A string consisting of the first characters of each string in `a` concatenated together.
   - `last_row`: A string consisting of the last characters of each string in `a` concatenated together.
   - `i`: Set to `n-1`.
   - There are specific conditions related to the uniqueness of characters in `a[0]`, `a[-1]`, `first_row`, and `last_row`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - Either the set of characters in `a[0]` does not contain a single unique character, or the set of characters in `a[-1]` does not contain a single unique character, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.
   - Either the set of characters in `first_row` does not contain a single unique character, or the set of characters in `last_row` does not contain a single unique character, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

3. **The Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('YES')
   ```

4. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variable values or conditions that affect the output.
   - The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided to be printed.

5. **Output:**
   - Based on the provided code snippet, the print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **YES**
