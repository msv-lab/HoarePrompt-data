The code snippet `a.append(input())` appends the input value to the list `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `first_row`, and `last_row`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input string, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string.**

In simpler terms, the list `a` now contains one element, which is the input string, while all other variables retain their initial values.
