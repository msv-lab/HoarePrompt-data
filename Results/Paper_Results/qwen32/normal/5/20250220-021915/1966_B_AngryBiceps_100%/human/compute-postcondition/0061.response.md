The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last string in the list `a` to the `first_row` string. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `a` is a list containing one input string
- `first_row` is an empty string
- `last_row` is an empty string
- `i` is `n - 1`

The value of `first_row` changes to the first character of the string in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n - 1`**
