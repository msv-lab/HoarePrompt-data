The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, which means the loop condition `i in range(n)` is no longer satisfied, and the loop has just ended.

To make the loop execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to a value less than `n`. Since `i` was `n` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to set `i` to `n-1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a`, `i` is `n-1`**
