The code snippet `a = []` reassigns the variable `a` to an empty list, regardless of its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each of the `n` input strings, `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each of the `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`.**
