The code snippet appends `k + 1` to the list `nums`. Therefore, the list `nums` will now have an additional element at the end, which is `k + 1`. The values of `n`, `k`, `t`, and `idx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `nums` is \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 8388608, k + 1]\), `idx` is 26.**
