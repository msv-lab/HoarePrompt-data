You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
        
        idx = 0
        
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        
        idx -= 1
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output will be the length of the modified `nums` list followed by the elements of the modified `nums` list. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and it represents the number of test cases processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` as input, constructs a list of specific values based on `k`, and outputs the length of this list followed by the list's elements. The number of test cases is determined by the input integer `t`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the requirements described in the problem statement.

### Problem Recap:
1. **No subsequence of `a` should sum to `k`.**
2. **For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.**
3. **The sequence `a` can have a size of at most 25.**

### Program Analysis:
The program generates a sequence of numbers and ensures that the sum of any subsequence does not equal `k` while ensuring all other sums from `1` to `n` (excluding `k`) can be achieved.

Here is the provided program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)
```

### Key Observations:
1. **Generating Powers of 2:** `nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]` creates a list of the first 24 powers of 2.
2. **Adjusting for `k`:** The program finds the highest power of 2 less than `k` and adjusts the sequence to avoid summing to `k`.
3. **Appending and Removing Elements:** It appends `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the sequence and removes the highest power of 2 less than `k`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Avoiding Sum `k`:** The program ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by removing a specific power of 2 and adding others.
2. **Covering All Other Sums:** The program attempts to cover all sums from `1` to `n` excluding `k` by using powers of 2 and adjusted values.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided example cases and some additional edge cases.

### Edge Case Testing:
Let's test with some edge cases to ensure the program handles all scenarios correctly.

#### Edge Case 1:
**Input:**
```
1
3 2
```
**Expected Output:**

```
**Expected Output:**
```
4
1 2 4 5
```
**Explanation:** The sequence `[1, 2, 4, 5]` covers sums `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` and avoids `3`.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing and testing the program with multiple cases, it seems to meet the requirements of the problem description. The program correctly generates a sequence that avoids summing to `k` while covering all other sums from `1` to `n` (excluding `k`).

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program generates a sequence using powers of 2 and adjusts it to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while covering all other sums from `1` to `n` excluding `k`. The provided test cases and additional edge cases confirm that the program works as intended.
