Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `nums` is a list of integers [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k - 4194304`, `k + 1`], `idx` is 22.**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains the first integer from the input. The value of `k` remains the second integer from the input. The value of `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. The list `nums` now includes an additional element `k + 1` at the end. The value of `idx` remains 22.
