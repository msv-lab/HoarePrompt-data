To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop processes each test case independently, and for each test case, it updates the `nums` list based on the values of `n` and `k`. The value of `t` represents the number of test cases, and it does not change during the loop execution.

The loop performs the following steps for each test case:
1. Initializes `nums` with powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).
2. Determines `idx` as the largest index such that \(2^{\text{idx}} \leq k\).
3. Modifies `nums` by removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and adding three new elements: \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\).
4. Prints the length of the updated `nums` list and the elements of `nums`.

The final output state after all iterations will be the result of processing all `t` test cases. Each test case modifies its own `nums` list independently, and the final state will include the results of all these modifications.

Given the format of the output states after the first few iterations, we can infer the following:
- For each test case, `nums` starts with the same initial list of powers of 2.
- `idx` is determined based on the value of `k` for that test case.
- The final `nums` list for each test case is printed, and it includes the modifications described above.

Since each test case is processed independently and the state of `t` does not change, the final output state will be the concatenation of the results of all test cases.

Output State: **For each test case, the output will be the length of the modified `nums` list followed by the elements of the modified `nums` list. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and it represents the number of test cases processed.**

In natural language, the final output state is the result of processing all `t` test cases, where for each test case, the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of the modified `nums` list are printed. The value of `t` remains the same as the initial number of test cases.
