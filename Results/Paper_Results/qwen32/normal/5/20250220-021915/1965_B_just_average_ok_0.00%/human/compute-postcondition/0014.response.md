The code appends a new value to the list `nums`. The new value is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Given that `idx` is 22, `nums[idx]` is `k - 4194304`. Therefore, the new value being appended is `k + (k - 4194304) + 1`, which simplifies to `2k - 4194303`.

After appending the new value, the list `nums` will have an additional element at the end. The other variables `n`, `k`, `t`, and `idx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `nums` is a list of integers [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k - 4194304`, `k + 1`, `2k - 4194303`], `idx` is 22.**
