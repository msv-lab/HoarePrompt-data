The code snippet provided updates the values of `n` and `k` by reading two integers from the input. The other variables (`t`, `nums`, `idx`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `nums` is a list of integers \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 8388608, k - 4194304, k + 1, 2k - 4194303]\), `idx` is 23.**
