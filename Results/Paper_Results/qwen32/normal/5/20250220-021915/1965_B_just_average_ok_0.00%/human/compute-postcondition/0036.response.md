The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which represents the loop variable, and the range function which depends on the input. The loop will execute as many times as the integer provided by the input. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `nums` is \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k + 1, 2k + 2]\).
- `idx` is 26.

Since the loop is defined as `for _ in range(int(input())):`, the loop will continue to execute as long as the number of iterations specified by the input has not been reached. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop variable `_` would have been incremented, but since `_` is not used in the loop body, we don't need to adjust its value specifically. Instead, we need to ensure that the range function still has iterations left.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have executed `n-1` times (assuming `n` is the number of times the loop is supposed to run). For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the current iteration count.

Since the loop variable `_` is not relevant to the state, and `n` dictates how many times the loop should run, we need to ensure that `n` is still greater than the current iteration count. Given that `idx` is 26, and assuming `idx` represents the current iteration (0-based index), the loop has run 26 times. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 27.

State: **`n` is at least 27, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `nums` is \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k + 1, 2k + 2]\), `idx` is 26**.
