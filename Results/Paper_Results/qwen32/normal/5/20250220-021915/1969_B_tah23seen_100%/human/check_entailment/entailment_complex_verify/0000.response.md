### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the problem and the provided solution to ensure that the program correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Sort a binary string `s` (consisting of '0's and '1's) in non-descending order.
- **Operation**: Perform cyclic shifts on any substring `s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r` with a cost of `r - l + 1`.
- **Goal**: Find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

#### Provided Solution:
```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost
```

#### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `cost` is initialized to 0, which will accumulate the total cost.
   - `one` is initialized to 0, which counts the number of '1's encountered so far.

2. **Iterating through the string**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is '1', increment the `one` counter.
     - If the character is '0' and there have been '1's encountered (`one > 0`), the cost is increased by `one + 1`. This logic implies that each '0' encountered after a sequence of '1's adds the cost of moving all those '1's to the left of the '0'.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation seems to follow the logic of moving all '1's encountered before a '0' to the left of the '0'. The cost is the number of '1's plus the '0' itself (`one + 1`).

#### Testing with Examples:
Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `10`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Calculation: `one = 1`, encounter '0', cost = `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - **Correct**

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `0000`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Calculation: No '1's encountered, cost remains `0`.
   - **Correct**

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `11000`
   - Expected Output: `9`
   - Calculation: `one = 2`, encounter '0', cost = `2 + 1 = 3`. `one = 2`, encounter '0', cost = `3 + 3 = 6`. `one = 2`, encounter '0', cost = `6 + 3 = 9`.
   - **Correct**

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `101011`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Calculation: `one = 1`, encounter '0', cost = `1 + 1 = 2`. `one = 2`, encounter '0', cost = `2 + 3 = 5`. `one = 2`, encounter '1', `one = 3`. `one = 3`, encounter '1', `one = 4`.
   - **Correct**

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `01101001`
   - Expected Output: `11`
   - Calculation: `one = 1`, encounter '0', cost = `1 + 1 = 2`. `one = 2`, encounter '0', cost = `2 + 3 = 5`. `one = 3`, encounter '0', cost = `5 + 4 = 9`. `one = 3`, encounter '1', `one = 4`. `one = 4`, encounter '0', cost = `9 + 5 = 14`. `one = 4`, encounter '1', `one = 5`. `one = 5`.
   - **Incorrect** (The expected output is `11`, but the calculation gives `14`).

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all cases. Specifically, the cost calculation logic (`cost += one + 1`) does not accurately reflect the minimum cost required to sort the string. The cost should be calculated based on the optimal cyclic shifts required to bring all '1's to the left of all '0's, which the current logic does not achieve correctly for all test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The program is incorrect because the cost calculation logic does not accurately determine the minimum cost for sorting the binary string in all scenarios.
