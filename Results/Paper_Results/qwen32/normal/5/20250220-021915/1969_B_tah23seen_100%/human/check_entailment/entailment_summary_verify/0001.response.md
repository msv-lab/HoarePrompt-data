### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program logic and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
Given a binary string `s`, we need to determine the minimum cost to sort it in non-descending order (i.e., all `0`s followed by all `1`s) using cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r-l+1` is `r-l+1`.

#### Program Analysis:
The program defines a function `func_1(s)` that calculates the cost to sort the string `s`. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cost` is initialized to `0`. This variable will accumulate the total cost.
   - `one` is initialized to `0`. This variable counts the number of `1`s encountered so far.

2. **Iterating Through the String**:
   - The program iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - If `i` is `'1'`, it increments the `one` counter.
   - If `i` is `'0'` and `one` is greater than `0`, it adds `one + 1` to `cost`.

#### Function Summary:
The function accepts a binary string `s` and returns the sum of `one + 1` for every sequence of consecutive '1's that is immediately followed by a '0'.

#### Correctness Analysis:
The logic behind the cost calculation is as follows:
- The cost `one + 1` is added whenever a `0` is encountered after some `1`s have been seen. This cost represents the cost of shifting the `1`s that have been encountered so far past the current `0`.
- The `+1` in `one + 1` accounts for the cost of including the current `0` in the cyclic shift.

Let's verify this with the example provided in the problem:

1. **Example 1: `s = "10"`**
   - `one` becomes `1` after the first character.
   - At the second character, `one` is `1` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Correct output: `2`.

2. **Example 2: `s = "0000"`**
   - `one` remains `0` throughout.
   - No `cost` is added.
   - Correct output: `0`.

3. **Example 3: `s = "11000"`**
   - `one` becomes `2` after the first two characters.
   - At the third character, `one` is `2` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - At the fourth character, `one` is `2` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `3 + 2 + 1 = 6`.
   - At the fifth character, `one` is `2` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `6 + 2 + 1 = 9`.
   - Correct output: `9`.

4. **Example 4: `s = "101011"`**
   - `one` becomes `1` after the first character.
   - At the second character, `one` is `1` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - `one` becomes `2` after the third character.
   - At the fourth character, `one` is `2` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `2 + 2 + 1 = 5`.
   - Correct output: `5`.

5. **Example 5: `s = "01101001"`**
   - `one` becomes `1` after the second character.
   - At the third character, `one` is `1` and `i` is `'1'`, so `one` becomes `2`.
   - At the fourth character, `one` is `2` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `2 + 2 + 1 = 5`.
   - `one` becomes `3` after the fifth character.
   - At the sixth character, `one` is `3` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `5 + 3 + 1 = 9`.
   - At the seventh character, `one` is `3` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `9 + 3 + 1 = 13`.
   - `one` becomes `4` after the eighth character.
   - The program seems to miss the correct cost calculation.

Upon closer inspection, the logic seems flawed. The cost calculation in the program does not correctly account for the minimum cost required to sort the string in all cases. The function summary does not fully capture the complexity of the problem, which involves more than just counting consecutive '1's followed by a '0'.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all cases, especially when there are multiple sequences of '1's separated by '0's.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
