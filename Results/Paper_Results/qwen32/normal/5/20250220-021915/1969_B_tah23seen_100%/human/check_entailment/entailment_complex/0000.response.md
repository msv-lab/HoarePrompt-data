### Reasoning:

The task is to determine the minimum cost needed to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The provided function `func_1` calculates the cost based on the following logic:

1. It iterates through the string `s`.
2. It counts the number of consecutive '1's encountered (`one` variable).
3. Whenever a '0' is encountered and there have been '1's before it (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`.

The key point here is to understand whether this logic correctly computes the minimum cost required to sort the binary string.

### Analysis of the provided function:

The function seems to be based on the idea that each sequence of consecutive '1's followed by a '0' contributes to the cost of sorting. However, the provided logic does not actually simulate the cyclic shifts needed to sort the string; it simply sums up `one + 1` for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0'.

This logic does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to sort the string. The cost calculation should reflect the actual operations needed to move '1's to the right of '0's, but the function does not do that.

### Correctness:

Given the problem description and the provided function, the function does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string. The function's logic is flawed because it does not simulate the actual cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
