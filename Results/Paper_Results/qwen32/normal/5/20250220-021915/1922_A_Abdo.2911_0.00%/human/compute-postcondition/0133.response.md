Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` and `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, `match_a_b` remains unchanged. `match_c` is True, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character, and `i` is 2. If `match_a_b` is False, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
