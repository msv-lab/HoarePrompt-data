The code snippet appends the character at index `i` of the string `a` to the list `template`. The value of `i` is 2, and `a` is a string with leading/trailing whitespace removed. The other variables (`match_a_b`, `match_c`, `t`, `n`, `b`, `c`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is True, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 2, and `template` has an additional element which is the character at index 2 of `a`.**
