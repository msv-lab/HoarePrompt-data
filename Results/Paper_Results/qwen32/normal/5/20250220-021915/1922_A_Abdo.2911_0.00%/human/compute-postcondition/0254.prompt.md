Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `template` is a list of `n` elements where each element is either the character from `a` or the uppercase version of the character from `a`, based on whether it matched `b` at that position; `match_a_b` is `True` if none of the conditions for setting `match_a_b` to `False` are met for any of the elements in `template`; `match_c` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `template` is a list, `i` is an index within the bounds of `template`, and `match_c` is a boolean. If the character at `template[i]` is lowercase and not equal to the character at `c[i]`, `match_c` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at `template[i]` is lowercase and equal to the character at `c[i]`, `match_c` retains its original value. If the element at `template[i]` is not lowercase and equal to the element at `c[i]` when both are converted to lowercase, `match_c` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_c` retains its original value and the loop or if statement continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `template` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`, `match_c` is `False` if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is lowercase, or if `c[i].lower()` is not equal to `template[i].lower()` when `template[i]` is not lowercase. Otherwise, `match_c` retains its value. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of only if `template[i]` is not lowercase and `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `template` is a list, `i` is 3, `n` is unchanged. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, or if `template[i]` is not lowercase and `c[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, `match_c` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_c` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
