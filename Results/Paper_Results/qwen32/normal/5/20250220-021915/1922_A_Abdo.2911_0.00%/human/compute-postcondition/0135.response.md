Output State: **`match_a_b` is False; `match_c` is True; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 2; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character; `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
