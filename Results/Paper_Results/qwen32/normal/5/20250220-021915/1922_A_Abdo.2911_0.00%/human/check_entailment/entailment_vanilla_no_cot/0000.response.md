To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze its logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
- Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

The matching rules are:
- If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be the same as the i-th letter of the template.
- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th letter of the template.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction:**
   - For each position `i` from `0` to `n-1`, it constructs the template `template`:
     - If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `template[i]` is set to `a[i]` (lowercase).
     - Otherwise, `template[i]` is set to `a[i].upper()` (uppercase).

3. **Matching Check:**
   - It checks if `a` and `b` match the template:
     - If `template[i]` is lowercase, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be equal to `template[i]`.
     - If `template[i]` is uppercase, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from `template[i].lower()`.
   - It checks if `c` does not match the template:
     - If `template[i]` is lowercase, `c[i]` must be equal to `template[i]`.
     - If `template[i]` is uppercase, `c[i]` must be different from `template[i].lower()`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not match the template, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness:
The program correctly constructs the template and checks the matching conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c` according to the problem statement. The logic and implementation align with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
