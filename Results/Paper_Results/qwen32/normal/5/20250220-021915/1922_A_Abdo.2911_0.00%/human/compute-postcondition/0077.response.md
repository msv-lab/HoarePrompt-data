Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is `False` if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value; `match_c` is `False` if `c[i] != template[i]`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i] == template[i]`, the values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` retain their original values, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 0.**
