Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `match_a_b` will be False if any of the conditions mentioned above are met at any iteration. Otherwise, it will remain True; `match_c` is True; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `match_a_b` will be False if any of the conditions mentioned above are met at any iteration. Otherwise, it will remain True. `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` (case-sensitive for lowercase `template[i]` and case-insensitive for uppercase `template[i]`). `t` is greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character; `i` is 0. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `template[i]` is not lowercase and `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (case-insensitive), `match_c` is set to False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `match_a_b` will be False if any of the conditions mentioned above are met at any iteration. Otherwise, it will remain True. `match_c` is set to False if `c[i]` does not match `template[i]` (case-sensitive for lowercase `template[i]` and case-insensitive for uppercase `template[i]`). If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_c` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `template[i]` is not lowercase and `c[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, `match_c` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `t` is greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character; `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `match_a_b` will be False if any of the conditions mentioned above are met at any iteration. Otherwise, it will remain True. If `template[i].islower()` and `c[i] != template[i]`, then `match_c` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `template[i].islower()` and `c[i] == template[i]`, then `match_c` remains unchanged. If `template[i]` is not lowercase and `c[i].lower() != template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `template[i]` is not lowercase and `c[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `t` is greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character; `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
