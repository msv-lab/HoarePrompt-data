Let's go through the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
1. We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
   - Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
   - String `c` does not match the template `t`.

2. Conditions for matching:
   - If the `i-th` letter of the template is lowercase, then the `i-th` letter of the string must be the same as the `i-th` letter of the template.
   - If the `i-th` letter of the template is uppercase, then the `i-th` letter of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the `i-th` letter of the template.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Template Construction**:
   - The program iterates through each character of `a` and `b`.
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, it adds that character (lowercase) to the template.
   - If the characters are different, it adds the uppercase version of the character from `a` to the template.

2. **Checking if `a` and `b` match the template**:
   - The program iterates through the template and checks if `a` and `b` match the template according to the rules:
     - If the template character is lowercase, it checks if both `a` and `b` have the same character at that position.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it checks if both `a` and `b` have different characters from the lowercase version of the template character at that position.

3. **Checking if `c` does not match the template**:
   - The program iterates through the template and checks if `c` does not match the template according to the rules:
     - If the template character is lowercase, it checks if `c` has the same character at that position.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it checks if `c` has a different character from the lowercase version of the template character at that position.

4. **Decision Making**:
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not match the template, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Verification:
- The template construction logic is correct. If characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, they must match the template with a lowercase character. If they are different, they must match the template with an uppercase character.
- The matching logic for `a` and `b` is correct. It correctly checks if both strings match the template according to the rules.
- The non-matching logic for `c` is correct. It correctly checks if `c` does not match the template according to the rules.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not match it.

Correctness: **True**
