The code snippet provided initializes a variable `match_a_b` to `False`. This change affects only this variable, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `template` is a list containing `n` characters, and `i` is `i + 1`; `match_a_b` is `False`.**
