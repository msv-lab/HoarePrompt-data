Postcondition: **`match_a_b` will be False if any of the conditions mentioned above are met at any iteration. Otherwise, it will remain True. `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` (case-sensitive for lowercase `template[i]` and case-insensitive for uppercase `template[i]`). `t` is greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character; `i` is 1. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_c` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
