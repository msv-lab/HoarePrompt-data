The code provided is a `break` statement, which will terminate the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. However, in this case, no loop or conditional block is explicitly shown, so the `break` statement does not affect the variables directly. The variables `template`, `i`, and `match_c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`template` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`, `match_c` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
