The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `match_a_b` is `False` if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value; `match_c` is `False`; `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
