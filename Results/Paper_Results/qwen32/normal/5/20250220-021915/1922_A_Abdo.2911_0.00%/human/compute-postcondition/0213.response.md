Output State: **`template` is a list of `n` elements where each element is either the character from `a` or the uppercase version of the character from `a`, based on whether it matched `b` at that position; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 4; `n` must be greater than 4; `match_a_b` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the state remains the same except that the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `match_a_b` is False.
