Output State: **`template` is a list of `n` elements where each element is either the character from `a` or the uppercase version of the character from `a`, based on whether it matched `b` at that position; `match_a_b` is `True` if none of the conditions for setting `match_a_b` to `False` are met for any of the elements in `template`; `match_c` is `True`.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `match_c` has been set to `True`. The values of `template` and `match_a_b` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
