The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes several variables (`template`, `match_a_b`, `match_c`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `template` remains the same (its value is not relevant for the print statement).
   - `match_a_b` remains the same (its value is not relevant for the print statement).
   - `match_c` is `True` (its value is not relevant for the print statement).

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print('NO')` statement directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Since the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions, the output is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
