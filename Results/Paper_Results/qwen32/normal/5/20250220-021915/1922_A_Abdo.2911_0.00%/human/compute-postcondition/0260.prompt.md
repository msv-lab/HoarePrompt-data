Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; a, b, and c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    template = []
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            template.append(a[i])
        else:
            template.append(a[i].upper())
    match_a_b = True
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i].islower():
            if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                match_a_b = False
                break
        elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
            ].lower():
            match_a_b = False
            break
    match_c = True
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i].islower():
            if c[i] != template[i]:
                match_c = False
                break
        elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
            match_c = False
            break
    if match_a_b and not match_c:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: match_a_b is True, and match_c is True. If match_a_b is True and match_c is False, then it would have been handled by the if part, but since match_c is True, the else part is executed, ensuring that it is not the case that match_a_b is True and match_c is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, or `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True. In all cases, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character, and `i` has completed all iterations from 0 to n-1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `template` remains the same, `match_a_b` remains the same, and `match_c` is `False` if `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` was initially `True`. Otherwise, `match_c` is `True`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
