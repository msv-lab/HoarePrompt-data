Output State: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `template` is a list containing `n` characters. Each character in `template` is either the corresponding character from `a` if it matches the character in `b` at the same position, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match, `match_a_b` is False, `template[i]` is an uppercase character, and either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches `template[i]` (ignoring case), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only terminates the most internal loop or if statement it is placed in. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values.
