The code appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `index`, `arr`) are not directly modified by this line of code, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]` before the increment; `index` is incremented by `n`; `arr` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`; `results` has `result` appended to it.**
