Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation. The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted or contains any decreasing elements, but it does not account for the possibility of achieving a sorted array by splitting and swapping the array parts.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists a point in the array where the array can be split into two parts such that the suffix is less than or equal to the prefix when swapped. This requires checking if the array can be rotated to become sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Find the number of places where the array is not in non-decreasing order
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > arr[(i + 1) % n]:
            count += 1
    # The array can be sorted by a single rotation if there is at most one such place
    return 'Yes' if count <= 1 else 'No'
```

This function checks if there is at most one place where the current element is greater than the next element (considering the array circularly). If there is at most one such place, the array can be rotated to become sorted.
