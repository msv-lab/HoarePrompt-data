Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element `a_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a positive integer, `index` is 2, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `index` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
