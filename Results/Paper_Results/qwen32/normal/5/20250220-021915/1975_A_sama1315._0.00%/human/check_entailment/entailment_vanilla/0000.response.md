The given Python program is designed to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts and these parts are swapped. Let's analyze the correctness of the program step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if an array can be sorted by repeatedly swapping its prefix and suffix.
   - The key observation is that if an array can be sorted by such operations, it must have a point where the array can be split into two parts such that the suffix is non-decreasing and the prefix is also non-decreasing when placed after the suffix.
   - This essentially means that the array should be a concatenation of two sorted subarrays.

2. **Function `func_1(arr)`:**
   - This function checks if the array is already sorted or if it can be split into two sorted subarrays.
   - The function uses a generator expression to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If there is any element that is greater than the next element, it checks if the array can be split into two sorted subarrays. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly implement this logic. It only checks if the array is sorted or not and returns 'No' if it finds any element greater than the next one, which is incorrect for the problem's requirement.

3. **Function `func_2()`:**
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the results.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases and the arrays for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each array and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness of the Program:

The main issue with the program is in the `func_1` function. The function does not correctly determine if the array can be split into two sorted subarrays. It only checks if the array is already sorted or not, which is not sufficient for the problem's requirements.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to find a point in the array where the array can be split into two sorted subarrays. Here is a possible implementation of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        # Check if arr[0:i] and arr[i:n] are both sorted
        if all(arr[j] <= arr[j + 1] for j in range(i - 1)) and all(arr[j] <= arr[j + 1] for j in range(i, n - 1)):
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'
```

However, the above implementation is not efficient for large arrays. A more efficient approach would be to find the first point where the array is not sorted and check if the rest of the array can be split into two sorted subarrays.

### Conclusion:
Given the current implementation of `func_1`, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
