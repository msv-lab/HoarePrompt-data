The code snippet creates a new list `arr` by converting elements of `data` from index `index` to `index + n` to integers. The value of `index` is increased by 1 before this operation, so the slicing starts from the new `index` value.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`.
- `index` is increased by 1.

After the code execution:
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements of `data` from `index` to `index + n` to integers.
- `index` is already increased by 1, so this value remains the same in the output state.

The other variables (`t` and `n`) are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`; `index` is increased by 1; `arr` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`.**
