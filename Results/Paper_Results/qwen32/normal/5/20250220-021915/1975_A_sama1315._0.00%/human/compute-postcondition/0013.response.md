The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable, and `t` which is the number of iterations the loop will perform. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. Since `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, it determines the total number of iterations.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, and the loop has executed some number of times already. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than the number of iterations that have already completed.

Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the loop continuation condition, we only need to adjust `t` to reflect the remaining iterations. However, the problem statement does not provide information on how many iterations have been completed so far. Therefore, we can only infer that for the next iteration to occur, `t` must be at least 1 (since it is decremented by 1 in each iteration).

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `result` holds the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**

However, since we are only allowed to adjust the objects in the loop head, the only adjustment we can make is to `t`. Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1**
