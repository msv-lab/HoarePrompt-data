The code snippet creates a list `arr` by converting elements from a slice of `data` starting at `index` and of length `n` to integers. The value of `index` is incremented by 1, but `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]` before the increment; `index` is incremented by 1; `arr` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`.**
