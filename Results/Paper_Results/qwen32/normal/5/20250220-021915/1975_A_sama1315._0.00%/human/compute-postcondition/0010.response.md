The value of `index` is incremented by `n`. Therefore, the new value of `index` is `2 + n`. The values of `arr`, `data`, `t`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
