Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`; `index` is increased by `n`; `arr` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**

Natural Language: The value of `t` remains the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1. The value of `n` remains the integer value of `data[index - 1]`. The value of `index` has been increased by `n`. The list `arr` contains integers from `data[index:index + n]`. The variable `result` is assigned the return value of the function `func_1` when called with `arr` as its argument.
