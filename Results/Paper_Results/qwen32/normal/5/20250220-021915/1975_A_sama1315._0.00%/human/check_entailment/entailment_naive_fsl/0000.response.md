Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing zero or more operations where the operation involves splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.
- The program should output "Yes" if it's possible to sort the array using the described operation, otherwise "No".

### Given Program:
```python
#Function 1:
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
    - The function first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
    - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
    - If the array is not sorted, it checks for any descending order elements using `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
    - If there are descending order elements, it returns 'No'.
    - If there are no descending order elements (which is logically impossible if the array is not sorted), it returns 'Yes'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case.
    - It collects the results and prints them.

### Issues:
- The logic in `func_1(arr)` is flawed. The condition `return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'` is incorrect. Just because there are descending order elements doesn't mean the array cannot be sorted using the described operation.
- The correct approach would be to check if there exists a point in the array where the array can be split into two parts such that the suffix is less than or equal to the prefix when swapped.

### Counterexample:
Consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`:
- The array is not sorted.
- However, it can be split into `[3]` and `[1, 2]`, and swapped to `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted.

The provided program would incorrectly return 'No' for this array.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix.

Correctness: **False**.
