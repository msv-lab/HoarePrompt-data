Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`. The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. Specifically, if `k` is within the valid range of 0 to n*(n-1)/2, it computes and returns a specific value or result; otherwise, it may handle the case where `k` is out of this range.**
