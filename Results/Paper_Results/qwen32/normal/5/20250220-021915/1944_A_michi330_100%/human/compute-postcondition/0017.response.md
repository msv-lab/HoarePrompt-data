Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `i` is an integer that is incremented by 1 for the next iteration; `n` and `k` are the first and second integers from the new input, respectively. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 regardless of whether `k >= n - 1` or not.**
