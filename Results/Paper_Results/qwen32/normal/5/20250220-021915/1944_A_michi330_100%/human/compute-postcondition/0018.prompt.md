Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. Each test case consists of two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, t, 1):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k >= n - 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `i` is initialized by the loop, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` satisfies `k >= n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` satisfies `k < n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. `i` is an integer that has been incremented by 1. `n` is the first integer from the new input, and `k` is the second integer from the new input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` satisfies `k >= n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` satisfies `k < n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `i` is an integer that is incremented by 1 for the next iteration; `n` and `k` are the first and second integers from the new input, respectively. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 regardless of whether `k >= n - 1` or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
