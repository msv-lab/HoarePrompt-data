The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. The variables `t` and `i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^3; `i` is an integer that is incremented by 1 for the next iteration; `n` and `k` are the first and second integers from the new input, respectively.**
