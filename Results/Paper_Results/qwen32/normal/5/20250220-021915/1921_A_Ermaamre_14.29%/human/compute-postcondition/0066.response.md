To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how it processes the input data. The loop iterates `a` times, and in each iteration, it reads the coordinates of the corners of a square and calculates the area of the square.

Here's a breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Input Reading**: In each iteration, the loop reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.
2. **Condition Checking**: The loop checks the orientation of the square by comparing the x-coordinates of the points.
3. **Area Calculation**: Depending on the orientation, it calculates the side length of the square (the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the appropriate points) and then computes the area by squaring this side length.
4. **Output**: The area of the square is printed.

Given that the loop runs `a` times, the final output state will be the result of all these iterations. Specifically, the loop will output the area of each square on separate lines.

### Output State Analysis

- **Initial State**: `t` is the number of test cases, and `a` is the number of squares to process in the current test case.
- **Loop Execution**: After `a` iterations, the loop will have processed all `a` squares and printed their areas.
- **Final State**: The final output state includes the areas of all `a` squares, printed one per line.

### Output State Format

The output state after all iterations is simply the printed areas of the squares, one per line. Since we do not have specific values for the coordinates, we can describe the final output state in terms of the areas calculated.

Output State: **The areas of all `a` squares, each printed on a new line.**

In natural language, the final output state is the list of areas of all the squares, with each area printed on a separate line.
