The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x2` and `y2`. The other variables `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x3`, `x4`, `y3`, `y4`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are integers provided by the input, `x2` and `y2` are integers provided by the input, `x3`, `x4`, `y3`, `y4` are integers provided by the input, and `res` is not defined by the given conditions unless further input is processed.**
