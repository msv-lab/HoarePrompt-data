Output State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are integers provided by the input, `x2` and `y2` are integers provided by the input, `x3` and `y3` are integers provided by the input, `x4` and `y4` are integers provided by the input, `res` is the absolute value of `y3 - y1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `res` is now the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
