Output State: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, and `y4` are integers provided by the input, `x1` is not equal to `x3` or `x2` is not equal to `x4`, it is not the case that `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, `x1 == x4`, `x3 == x2`, `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `a` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 0, the values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, and `y4` remain the same as provided by the input, with the additional condition that `x1` equals `x4` and `x3` equals `x2`. The variable `y1` is still greater than or equal to `y2`. A new variable `res` is introduced and is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.
