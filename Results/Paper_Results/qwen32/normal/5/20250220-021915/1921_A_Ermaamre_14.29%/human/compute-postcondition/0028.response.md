Postcondition: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, and `y4` are integers provided by the input. If `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. If `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. In all other cases, the value of `res` is not defined by the given conditions.**
