### Reasoning:
The program is designed to find the area of a square given its four corners with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The logic involves identifying pairs of points that share the same x-coordinate or y-coordinate to determine the side length of the square.

Let's break down the logic and verify it with the annotations and examples provided:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the coordinates for each test case.
2. **Identifying Side Length**:
   - The program checks for pairs of points that share the same x-coordinate to determine the vertical sides of the square.
   - It calculates the side length by finding the absolute difference in the y-coordinates of these points.
   - Similarly, it checks for pairs of points that share the same y-coordinate to determine the horizontal sides.
   - It calculates the side length by finding the absolute difference in the x-coordinates of these points.
3. **Area Calculation**: Once the side length is determined, the program squares it to get the area and prints it.

### Example Verification:
**Test Case 1:**
- Points: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
- The program identifies that (1, 2) and (1, 5) share the same x-coordinate, so the side length is |5 - 2| = 3.
- Area = 3^2 = 9

**Test Case 2:**
- Points: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
- The program identifies that (-1, 1) and (-1, -1) share the same x-coordinate, so the side length is |1 - (-1)| = 2.
- Area = 2^2 = 4

**Test Case 3:**
- Points: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
- The program identifies that (45, 11) and (45, 39) share the same x-coordinate, so the side length is |39 - 11| = 28.
- Area = 28^2 = 784

The program correctly calculates the area for all provided test cases.

### Annotations:
The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, confirming that the program reads inputs correctly and processes them to find the side length and area of the square.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the area of the square given its corners. The original assessment is accurate, and there are no issues with the program's behavior as described by the annotations and the example verification.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
