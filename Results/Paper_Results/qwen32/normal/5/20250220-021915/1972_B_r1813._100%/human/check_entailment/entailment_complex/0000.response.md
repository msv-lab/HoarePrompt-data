### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the number of facing-up coins. The key insight is that Alice wins if and only if the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) is odd. This is because each move removes one facing-up coin and flips the adjacent coins, which does not change the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, if the initial count of `'U'` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by maintaining the odd count of `'U'` until the end. Conversely, if the count is even, Bob can always respond in such a way that Alice is left with an even count of `'U'`, leading to Bob's victory.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It reads the input, processes each test case by counting the number of `'U'` in the string `s`, and prints `'YES'` if the count is odd and `'NO'` if it is even. This matches the optimal strategy derived from the problem statement.
