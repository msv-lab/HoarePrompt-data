The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The loop depends on the variable `t`, which represents the number of iterations remaining. According to the problem, `t` is a positive integer minus 1 at the end of the previous iteration.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `t` to reflect that one more iteration is about to occur. Since `t` is a positive integer minus 1, it means that `t` was originally a positive integer representing the total number of iterations, and it has been decremented by 1 after each iteration. Therefore, to execute one more iteration, `t` should be incremented by 1.

However, since `t` is a positive integer minus 1 at the end of the previous iteration, to start the next iteration, `t` should remain as it is because the loop condition checks if `t` is greater than 0, and it will decrement `t` by 1 at the start of each iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`data` is a list where the first element is a string representation of a positive integer `t`, `t` is a positive integer minus 1, `index` is 5, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `s` is `data[4]`, and `count_u` is the number of 'U's in `data[4]`.**
