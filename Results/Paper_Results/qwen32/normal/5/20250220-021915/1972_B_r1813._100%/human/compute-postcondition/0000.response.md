The provided code snippet only reads the input from the standard input but does not process it or assign it to any variables. Therefore, the values of the variables do not change based on the provided code snippet. The output state will reflect the initial state with the addition of the input that has been read.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down. The input has been read and stored in the variable `input`.**
