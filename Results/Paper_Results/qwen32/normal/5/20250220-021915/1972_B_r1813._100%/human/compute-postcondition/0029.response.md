Postcondition: **`data` is a list where the first element is a string representation of a positive integer `t`, `t` is a positive integer minus 1, `index` is 7, `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`, `s` is `data[6]`, and `count_u` is the number of 'U's in `s`. Whether `count_u` is odd or even, the values of `data`, `t`, `index`, `n`, `s`, and `count_u` remain unchanged.**
