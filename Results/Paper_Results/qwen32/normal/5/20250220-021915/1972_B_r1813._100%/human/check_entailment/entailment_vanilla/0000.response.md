Reasoning:
The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the number of facing-up coins and their strategic removal. The key insight is that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win, and if it is even, Bob will win. This is because each player can only remove a facing-up coin, and flipping the adjacent coins does not change the parity (odd or even nature) of the count of facing-up coins.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splitting it into a list of strings.
2. The first element of the list is the number of test cases, `t`.
3. For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the coins.
4. It counts the number of 'U' (facing-up coins) in the string `s`.
5. If the count of 'U' is odd, it prints 'YES', indicating Alice wins. If the count is even, it prints 'NO', indicating Bob wins.

The logic correctly implements the winning condition based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
