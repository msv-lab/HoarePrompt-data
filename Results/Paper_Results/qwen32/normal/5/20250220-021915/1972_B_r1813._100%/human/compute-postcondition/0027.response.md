Let's analyze the given task step by step.

### Initial State:
- `data` is a list where the first element is a string representation of a positive integer `t`.
- `t` is a positive integer minus 1.
- `index` is 7.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`.
- `s` is `data[6]`.
- `count_u` is the number of 'U's in `s`.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward. It prints the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables `data`, `t`, `index`, `n`, `s`, and `count_u`.

### Output:
The print statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
