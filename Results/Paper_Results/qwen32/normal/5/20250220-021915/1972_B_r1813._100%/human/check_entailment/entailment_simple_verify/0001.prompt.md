You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.

    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        s = data[index + 1]

        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `data` is a list where the first element is a string representation of a positive integer `t`, `t` is 0, `index` is `2 * t + 1`, `n` and `s` are undefined since the loop has finished executing, and `count_u` is undefined since the loop has finished executing. The loop has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the number of 'U's in the respective strings `s`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the number of facing-up coins and their strategic removal. The key insight is that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win, and if it is even, Bob will win. This is because each player can only remove a facing-up coin, and flipping the adjacent coins does not change the parity (odd or even nature) of the count of facing-up coins.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splitting it into a list of strings.
2. The first element of the list is the number of test cases, `t`.
3. For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the coins.
4. It counts the number of 'U' (facing-up coins) in the string `s`.
5. If the count of 'U' is odd, it prints 'YES', indicating Alice wins. If the count is even, it prints 'NO', indicating Bob wins.

The logic correctly implements the winning condition based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
