### Reasoning:
The provided program logic is based on the observation that the player who starts the game (Alice) will win if the number of facing-up coins ('U') is odd, and will lose if the number of facing-up coins is even. This is because each move flips two adjacent coins, and the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins changes with each move. If the initial count of 'U' is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where the count of 'U' is even, and vice versa.

Let's break down the program's flow and correctness based on the provided states and the problem description:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings `data`.
   - The first element of `data` is the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the coins.
   - It counts the number of 'U's in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - If the count of 'U's is odd (`count_u % 2 == 1`), it prints 'YES', indicating Alice wins.
   - If the count of 'U's is even, it prints 'NO', indicating Bob wins.

4. **State After Execution:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program has printed the correct result for each test case based on the parity of the number of 'U's in the respective strings.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **First Test Case:**
  - `n = 5`, `s = "UUDUD"`
  - `count_u = 3` (which is odd)
  - Expected output: "YES"

- **Second Test Case:**
  - `n = 5`, `s = "UDDUD"`
  - `count_u = 2` (which is even)
  - Expected output: "NO"

- **Third Test Case:**
  - `n = 2`, `s = "UU"`
  - `count_u = 2` (which is even)
  - Expected output: "NO"

The program correctly outputs "YES", "NO", "NO" for the provided example, which matches the expected results.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
