#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        s = data[index + 1]
        
        index += 2
        
        count_u = s.count('U')
        
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `data` is a list where the first element is a string representation of a positive integer `t`, `t` is 0, `index` is `2 * t + 1`, `n` and `s` are undefined since the loop has finished executing, and `count_u` is undefined since the loop has finished executing. The loop has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the number of 'U's in the respective strings `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of coins and their respective states (up or down). For each test case, it determines if the number of coins facing up is odd, and prints 'YES' if it is, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
