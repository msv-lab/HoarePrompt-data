The code snippet reassigns `n` to the length of the list `arr`. Given that `n` was initially defined as the length of the list `arr`, reassigning `n` to `len(arr)` does not change its value. Therefore, the value of `n` remains the same, and `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `i` is 0.**
