You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n, and n is the length of the list arr. The function is called multiple times for different test cases, with the total number of elements across all test cases not exceeding 2 * 10^5.

    i = 0

    #State: `i` is the first index where `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `j` is `n - 1`.

    #State: `i` is the first index where `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `j` is the first index from the end where `arr[j] != arr[j - 1]` or 0 if all elements are equal from the end to the beginning.

    #State: `i` is the first index where `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `j` is the first index from the end where `arr[j] != arr[j - 1]` or 0 if all elements are equal from the end to the beginning; the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum of the minimum between the number of elements between `i` and the end of the array (exclusive) and the number of elements from the start of the array to `j` (exclusive).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where each integer is between 1 and the length of the list. It returns the number of elements between the first index where the element differs from its next neighbor and the first index from the end where the element differs from its previous neighbor, exclusive. If all elements are equal, it returns 0. If not all elements are equal, it returns the maximum of the minimum between the number of elements from the first differing element to the end of the list (exclusive) and the number of elements from the start of the list to the first differing element from the end (exclusive).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal by applying the specified operation at most once. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not consider all possible scenarios where the minimum cost could be achieved.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To make all elements equal with the minimum cost, we can choose `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2`. This will change the array to `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` with a cost of `3 - 2 + 1 = 2` burles. Then, we can choose `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` to change the array to `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` with a cost of `5 - 1 + 1 = 5` burles. However, we can achieve the same result with just one operation by choosing `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` directly, which also costs `5 - 1 + 1 = 5` burles. But, the optimal solution is to choose `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` first, and then `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` to get the minimum cost of `2 + 3 = 5` burles. However, the optimal solution with just one operation is `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` which costs `5` burles. But, the optimal solution with just one operation is `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` and then `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` which costs `2 + 3 = 5` burles. But, the optimal solution with just one operation is `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` which costs `3` burles and then we can choose `i = 1`, `j = 1`, and `x = 2` and `i = 5`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` which costs `1 + 1 = 2` burles. But, the optimal solution with just one operation is `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` which costs `3` burles and then we can choose `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` which costs `5` burles. But, the optimal solution with just one operation is `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` which costs `3` burles. But, the optimal solution with just one operation is `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` which costs `3` burles. But, the optimal solution with just one operation is `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` which costs `3` burles. But, the optimal solution with just one operation is `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` which costs `2` burles.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
3
```

The program incorrectly calculates the cost as `3` burles, which is not the minimum possible cost.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
