The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after the operation, `i` becomes 2. The other variables `arr`, `j`, and `n` are not affected by this operation. The precondition that `arr` is a list of integers where `len(arr) > 2` and `arr[1] == arr[2]` remains valid.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where `len(arr) > 2` and `arr[1] == arr[2]`; `i` is 2; `j` is `n - 1`**.
