The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `j` is initially set to `n - 1` where `n` is at least 2 and `arr[n - 1] == arr[n - 2]`. After the decrement, `j` will be `n - 2`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is defined as the first index where `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal.

Output State: **`i` is the first index where `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `j` is `n - 2` where `n` is at least 2 and `arr[n - 1] == arr[n - 2]`**.
