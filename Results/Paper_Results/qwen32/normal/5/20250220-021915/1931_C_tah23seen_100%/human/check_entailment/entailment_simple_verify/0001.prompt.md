You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding the minimum cost in burles to make all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation of assigning a value `x` to a subarray from index `i` to `j`. The cost of this operation is `(j - i + 1)` burles.

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of a main loop that handles multiple test cases and a function `func_1` that computes the minimum cost for a given array.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `j` is initialized to the last index of the array (`len(arr) - 1`).

2. **Finding the first segment of equal elements from the start:**
   - `i` is incremented as long as `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.

3. **Finding the first segment of equal elements from the end:**
   - `j` is decremented as long as `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.

4. **Checking if the entire array is the same:**
   - If `arr[0] == arr[-1]`, it means the whole array is already equal, and the cost is `max(j - i - 1, 0)`. This seems incorrect because if the array is already equal, the cost should be 0, not `j - i - 1`.

5. **Calculating the cost if the array is not entirely equal:**
   - The function returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`. This part seems to be trying to calculate the minimum cost of making the array equal by considering the segments found, but it does not correctly account for the cost of making the entire array equal in all cases.

### Correctness Check

The program does not handle all cases correctly. Let's consider a few examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`
   - The program should output `4` because the optimal operation is to change all elements to `3` (or any other value) by selecting the subarray from index `1` to `4` (cost = 4).
   - The program's logic fails here because it calculates `max(min(6 - 0 - 1, 4), 0) = 4`, which is correct, but the logic is not robust.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`
   - The program should output `2` because the optimal operation is to change the subarray from index `3` to `4` to `8` (cost = 2).
   - The program's logic fails here because it calculates `max(min(8 - 0 - 1, 3), 0) = 3`, which is incorrect.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - The program should output `2` because the optimal operation is to change the subarray from index `0` to `1` to `3` (cost = 2) or from index `1` to `2` to `1` (cost = 2).
   - The program's logic fails here because it calculates `max(min(3 - 0 - 1, 1), 0) = 1`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases and does not always return the minimum cost required to make all elements of the array equal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
