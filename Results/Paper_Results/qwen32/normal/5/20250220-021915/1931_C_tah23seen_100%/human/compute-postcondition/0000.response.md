The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `i`. No other variables are affected. The precondition about `arr` being a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= n`, and `n` being the length of the list `arr`, remains valid.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `i` is 0.**
