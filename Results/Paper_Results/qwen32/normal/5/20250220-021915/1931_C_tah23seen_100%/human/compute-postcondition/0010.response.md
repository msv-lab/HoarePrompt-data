To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop increments `i` as long as the current element `arr[i]` is equal to the next element `arr[i + 1]`. The loop stops when either `i` reaches the second-to-last index of the list or the current element is not equal to the next element.

Given the initial state and the states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:
- The loop has been running as long as consecutive elements in the list are equal.
- After 3 iterations, `arr[0] == arr[1] == arr[2] == arr[3]`, and `i` is 3.

The loop will continue to run until it finds an element that is not equal to the next element or until `i` reaches `len(arr) - 1`.

The final output state will be:
- `i` will be the index of the first element that is not equal to the next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal.
- `j` remains unchanged as `n - 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact contents of `arr` beyond the first few elements, we can only describe the final state in terms of `i` and `j`:

Output State: **`i` is the first index where `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `j` is `n - 1`.**

In simpler terms, `i` will point to the first element that breaks the sequence of equal elements, or to the last element if all elements are the same. `j` will remain as the last index of the list.
