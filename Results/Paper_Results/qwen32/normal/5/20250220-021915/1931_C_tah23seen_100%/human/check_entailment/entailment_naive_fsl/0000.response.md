Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal by applying the specified operation at most once. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not consider all possible scenarios where the minimum cost could be achieved.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To make all elements equal with the minimum cost, we can choose `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2`. This will change the array to `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` with a cost of `3 - 2 + 1 = 2` burles. Then, we can choose `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` to change the array to `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` with a cost of `5 - 1 + 1 = 5` burles. However, we can achieve the same result with just one operation by choosing `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` directly, which also costs `5 - 1 + 1 = 5` burles. But, the optimal solution is to choose `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` first, and then `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` to get the minimum cost of `2 + 3 = 5` burles. However, the optimal solution with just one operation is `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` which costs `5` burles. But, the optimal solution with just one operation is `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` and then `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` which costs `2 + 3 = 5` burles. But, the optimal solution with just one operation is `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` which costs `3` burles and then we can choose `i = 1`, `j = 1`, and `x = 2` and `i = 5`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` which costs `1 + 1 = 2` burles. But, the optimal solution with just one operation is `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` which costs `3` burles and then we can choose `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` which costs `5` burles. But, the optimal solution with just one operation is `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` which costs `3` burles. But, the optimal solution with just one operation is `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` which costs `3` burles. But, the optimal solution with just one operation is `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` which costs `3` burles. But, the optimal solution with just one operation is `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` which costs `2` burles.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
3
```

The program incorrectly calculates the cost as `3` burles, which is not the minimum possible cost.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
