Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding

The task is to make all elements of the array equal by applying at most one operation of setting a subarray to a specific value `x`. The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray being modified. We need to find the minimum cost to make all elements in the array equal.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements. It then calls a function `func_1` to determine the minimum cost.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `i` is initialized to `0` (start of the array).
   - `j` is initialized to `len(arr) - 1` (end of the array).

2. **Finding the Starting and Ending Segments**:
   - The first `while` loop increments `i` as long as the current element is the same as the next one. This finds the length of the initial segment of identical elements from the start.
   - The second `while` loop decrements `j` as long as the current element is the same as the previous one. This finds the length of the final segment of identical elements from the end.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same (`arr[0] == arr[-1]`), the cost is the length of the middle segment (`j - i - 1`), but since we can't have a negative cost, we take `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
   - If the first and last elements are different, the cost is the minimum of changing the middle segment to match the start or the end (`min(n - i - 1, j)`).

### Correctness Check

Let's consider the sample test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `6, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`
   - `i` stops at `0` (since `arr[0] != arr[1]`).
   - `j` stops at `5` (since `arr[5] != arr[4]`).
   - `arr[0] != arr[-1]`, so the cost is `min(6 - 0 - 1, 5) = min(5, 5) = 5`. However, the program returns `4`, which is incorrect.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `7, [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - `i` and `j` both stop at `0` and `6` respectively (since all elements are the same).
   - `arr[0] == arr[-1]`, so the cost is `max(6 - 0 - 1, 0) = max(5, 0) = 5`. However, the program returns `0`, which is correct.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `8, [8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`
   - `i` stops at `2` (since `arr[2] != arr[3]`).
   - `j` stops at `5` (since `arr[5] != arr[6]`).
   - `arr[0] == arr[-1]`, so the cost is `max(5 - 2 - 1, 0) = max(2, 0) = 2`. The program returns `2`, which is correct.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `1, [1]`
   - `i` and `j` both stop at `0`.
   - `arr[0] == arr[-1]`, so the cost is `max(0, 0) = 0`. The program returns `0`, which is correct.

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `2, [1, 2]`
   - `i` stops at `0`.
   - `j` stops at `1`.
   - `arr[0] != arr[-1]`, so the cost is `min(2 - 0 - 1, 1) = min(1, 1) = 1`. The program returns `1`, which is correct.

6. **Test Case 6**:
   - Input: `3, [1, 2, 3]`
   - `i` stops at `0`.
   - `j` stops at `2`.
   - `arr[0] != arr[-1]`, so the cost is `min(3 - 0 - 1, 2) = min(2, 2) = 2`. The program returns `2`, which is correct.

7. **Test Case 7**:
   - Input: `7, [4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`
   - `i` stops at `0`.
   - `j` stops at `4`.
   - `arr[0] != arr[-1]`, so the cost is `min(7 - 0 - 1, 4) = min(6, 4) = 4`. However, the program returns `6`, which is incorrect.

8. **Test Case 8**:
   - Input: `9, [9, 9, 2, 9, 2, 5, 5, 5, 3]`
   - `i` stops at `1`.
   - `j` stops at `5`.
   - `arr[0] != arr[-1]`, so the cost is `min(9 - 1 - 1, 5) = min(7, 5) = 5`. However, the program returns `7`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when the first and last elements are different and the cost calculation is more complex than just the minimum of the two segments. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
