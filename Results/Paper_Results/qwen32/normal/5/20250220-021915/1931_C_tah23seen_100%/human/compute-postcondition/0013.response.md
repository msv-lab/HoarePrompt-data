The variables in the loop head are `j` and `arr[j]` and `arr[j - 1]`. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j > 0` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 2` where `n` is at least 2 and `arr[n - 1] == arr[n - 2]`. This means that `arr[j] == arr[j + 1]` initially. However, after the loop body executes, `j` is decremented by 1, so for the loop to execute again, `j` must still be greater than 0 and `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `j` should be decremented by 1 (as it would be in the loop body) and `arr[j]` should be equal to `arr[j - 1]`. Given the initial condition, we can assume that `arr[j] == arr[j + 1]` before the loop body executes, so after decrementing `j`, `arr[j]` should still be equal to `arr[j - 1]`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted such that `j` is decremented by 1 and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.

State: **`i` is the first index where `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `j` is `n - 3` where `n` is at least 2 and `arr[n - 3] == arr[n - 2]`**
