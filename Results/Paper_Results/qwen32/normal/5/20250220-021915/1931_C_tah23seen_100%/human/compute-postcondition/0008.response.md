The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was initially 2, it becomes 3. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `arr` is still a list of integers where `len(arr) > 3`, `arr[1] == arr[2]`, and `arr[2] == arr[3]`; `j` is still `n - 1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where `len(arr) > 3`, `arr[1] == arr[2]`, and `arr[2] == arr[3]`; `i` is 3; `j` is `n - 1`.**
