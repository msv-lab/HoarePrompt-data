You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)



- Function Summary: 
The function calculates and prints the minimum total cost to buy all buns for each of the given test cases, considering a special price for the first bun in each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Reading Input:**
   The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Determine `k`:**
   The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This is a crucial step because it determines the number of buns to sell at the modified price. If `b - a` is less than `n`, then `k` will be `b - a`, meaning we can only sell `b - a` buns at the modified price because the price of the `b - a + 1`th bun would be `a` (since `b - (b - a + 1) + 1 = a`), which is the usual price. If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` will be `n`, meaning we can sell all `n` buns at the modified price.

3. **Calculate Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so the program prints `a * n`, which is the total profit if all buns are sold at the usual price.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the total profit:
     - The profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`. This is because the prices of the first `k` buns form an arithmetic sequence from `b` down to `b - k + 1`.
     - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price is `(n - k) * a`.

4. **Output:**
   For each test case, the program prints the maximum profit.

Let's check the given examples:

- **Example 1:** `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
  - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
  - Profit = `(5 + (5 - 1 + 1)) // 2 * 1 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
  - Correct output is `17`.

- **Example 2:** `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 5`
  - Profit = `(9 + (9 - 5 + 1)) // 2 * 5 = 35`
  - Correct output is `35`.

- **Example 3:** `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
  - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
  - Profit = `10 * 10 = 100`
  - Correct output is `100`.

- **Example 4:** `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
  - Profit = `(11 + (11 - 5 + 1)) // 2 * 5 = 45`
  - Correct output is `45`.

- **Example 5:** `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
  - `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0`
  - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000`
  - Correct output is `1000000000000000000`.

- **Example 6:** `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1`
  - `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = 0`
  - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000`
  - Correct output is `1000000000000000000`.

- **Example 7:** `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
  - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
  - Profit = `(1000 + (1000 - 999 + 1)) // 2 * 999 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 500500`
  - Correct output is `500500`.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly calculates the maximum profit for each test case.
