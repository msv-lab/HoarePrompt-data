Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers: `n` (the number of buns), `a` (the usual price of a bun), and `b` (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). For each test case, the function returns the minimum total cost to buy all `n` buns, considering the special price for the first bun.**
