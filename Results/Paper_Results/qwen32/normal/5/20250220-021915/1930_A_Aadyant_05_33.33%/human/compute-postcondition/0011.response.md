The code snippet appends an integer value to `list2` by converting the string at index `2 * i` of `list1` to an integer. Given that `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from `b`, and `i` is not specified, we assume `i` is a valid index such that `2 * i` is within the bounds of `list1`.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is an empty list, `list2` contains the integer value of `list1[2 * i]`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from `b`, `a` must be greater than or equal to 1, `b` is the string input provided by the user.**

In simple terms, `list2` now includes the integer value from the substring at position `2 * i` in `list1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
