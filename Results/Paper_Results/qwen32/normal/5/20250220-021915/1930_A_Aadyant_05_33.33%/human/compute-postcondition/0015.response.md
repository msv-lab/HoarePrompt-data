The code snippet appends the integer value of `list1[2 * i]` to `list2`. Given the initial state, `list2` already contains the integer value of `list1[2 * i]` and the newly appended integer value of `list1[2 * (i + 1)]`. After executing the code, `list2` will have an additional element, which is the integer value of `list1[2 * i]` appended again.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is an empty list, `list2` contains the integer value of `list1[2 * i]`, the newly appended integer value of `list1[2 * (i + 1)]`, and the integer value of `list1[2 * i]` appended again, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from `b`, `a` must be greater than or equal to 1, `b` is the string input provided by the user, `i` is incremented by 1.**
