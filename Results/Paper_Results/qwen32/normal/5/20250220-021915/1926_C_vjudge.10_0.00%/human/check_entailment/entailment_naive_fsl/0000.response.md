Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from working correctly according to the problem description.

1. **Global Variable Usage**: The variable `soma` is used as a global variable and is not reset between test cases. This means that the sum from previous test cases will carry over, leading to incorrect results for subsequent test cases.

2. **Incorrect Loop Range**: The loop `for i in range(n):` should start from 1 to `n` (inclusive), not from 0 to `n-1`. The current code incorrectly sums the digit sums from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Function Definition Placement**: The function `func_1` is defined after it is used in the loop, which would cause a `NameError` in Python.

4. **Output Handling**: The code does not handle the output for each test case separately. Instead, it sums all results together and prints them once, which is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

def main():
    T = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = sum(digit_sum(i) for i in range(1, n + 1))
        results.append(total_sum)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

main()
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned:
- It resets the sum for each test case.
- It correctly iterates from 1 to `n`.
- It defines the function before it is used.
- It handles the output for each test case separately.
