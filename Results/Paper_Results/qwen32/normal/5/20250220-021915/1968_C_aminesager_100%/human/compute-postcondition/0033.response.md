Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`, `a` is a list [1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]], `i` is n, `result` is a space-separated string representation of the list `a`, `line` is the input string**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` reassigns the value of `n` to the integer value of the input provided by the user. However, since the problem statement already defines `n` as "an input integer greater than 1", this line does not change the value of `n` but rather confirms it. All other variables remain unchanged.
