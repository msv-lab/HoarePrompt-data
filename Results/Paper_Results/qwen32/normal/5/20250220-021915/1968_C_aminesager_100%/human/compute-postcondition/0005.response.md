The code converts the input string `line` into a list of integers and assigns it to the variable `T`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, where 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`.**
