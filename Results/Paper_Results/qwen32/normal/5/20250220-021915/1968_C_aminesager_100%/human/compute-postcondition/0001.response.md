To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the variable `t` in the loop head. The loop will execute as long as `t` is truthy. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered truthy, and zero is considered falsy.

Given the state right before the `while` loop is `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that `t` is not zero. Since the provided range already ensures that `t` is between 1 and 10,000, it is guaranteed to be non-zero and thus truthy.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the state of `t` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
