The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3 for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`; `a` is a list containing the integers `1000`, `1000 + T[0]`, and `1000 + T[0] + T[1]`; `i` is 3**
