The code `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends a new element to the list `a`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]`, which is `1000`, and `T[i - 1]` is `T[0]`, which is the first element of the list `T`. Therefore, the new element appended to `a` is `1000 + T[0]`.

The updated list `a` will be `[1000, 1000 + T[-1], 1000 + T[0]]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the new input string `line`, `a` is a list `[1000, 1000 + T[-1], 1000 + T[0]]`, `i` is 1, `result` is a space-separated string representation of the list `a`, `line` is the new input string**.
