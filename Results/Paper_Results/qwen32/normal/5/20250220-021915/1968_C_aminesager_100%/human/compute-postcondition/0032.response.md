Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`, `a` is a list [1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]], `i` is n, `result` is a space-separated string representation of the list `a`, `line` is the input string**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
