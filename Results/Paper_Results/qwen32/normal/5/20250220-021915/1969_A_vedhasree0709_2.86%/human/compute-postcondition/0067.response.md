Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1 if `l[0]` is 2 and `l[1]` is 1, otherwise `j` remains 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `l` is a list of integers from the input.**

In simple terms, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. The values of `j`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.
