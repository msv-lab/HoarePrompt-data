Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been changed to 1 from its initial value of 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
