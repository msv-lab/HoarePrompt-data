Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` must be at least 3; `l` is the list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2; `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
