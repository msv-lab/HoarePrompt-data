Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `i` is 2.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(2)` statement will print the integer `2` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, or `i`. The value `2` is explicitly provided in the print statement and does not depend on any variable or condition in the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **2**
