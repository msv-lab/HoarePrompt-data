The code snippet `i += 1` simply increments the value of `i` by 1. The conditions and the value of `j` are not affected by this operation. The precondition that `n` must be at least `i + 2` still holds, but now `i` has a new value. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement (`l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`) is not evaluated by this code snippet, so `j` remains unchanged unless the subsequent code evaluates this condition.

Output State: **`j` is 1 if `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `i` is increased by 1; `n` must be at least `i + 2`.**
