The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the previous value of `n` is overwritten by the new input integer. The values of `t`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is the list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is either the previous `n` or the value at which the condition was met; `j` is 0**.
