The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which is the current element being iterated over from the list `arr`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next element in the list `arr`.

Given:
- `arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100.
- `frequency_table` is a dictionary that has been modified in the previous iteration based on the condition provided.

The loop iterates over each element in `arr`. At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was the last element processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be the next element in `arr`.

Since we do not have the specific elements of `arr` or the current position of `num` in the list, we can only describe the state in a general way. If `num` was the last element in the previous iteration, then the loop will execute again if there are more elements in `arr`. The next `num` will be the next element in the list.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary, and `num` is the next element in `arr` after the previously processed element.**
