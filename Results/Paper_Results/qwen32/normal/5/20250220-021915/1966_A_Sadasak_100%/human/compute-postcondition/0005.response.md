Postcondition: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary. If `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, then `frequency_table[num]` is set to `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged.**
