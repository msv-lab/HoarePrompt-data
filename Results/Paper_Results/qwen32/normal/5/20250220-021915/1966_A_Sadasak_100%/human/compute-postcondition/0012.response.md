Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the count of `num` set to `k`, and `num` is the next element in `arr` after the previously processed element.**

Explanation: The value of `frequency_table[num]` is set to `k`, meaning the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is now `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
