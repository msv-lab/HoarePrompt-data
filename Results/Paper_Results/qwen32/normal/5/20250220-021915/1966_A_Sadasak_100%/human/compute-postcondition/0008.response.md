The code `frequency_table[num] = k` updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by setting the count of `num` to `k`. This means that whatever the previous count of `num` was in `frequency_table`, it is now replaced with the value of `k`. The values of `arr`, `k`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num`'s count set to `k`, `num` is the next element in `arr` after the previously processed element.**
