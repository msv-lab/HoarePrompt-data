The code snippet increments the count of `num` in the `frequency_table` dictionary by 1. If `num` was not previously in the dictionary, it is added with a count of 1.

Given the initial state, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary that may have some counts already set to `k` or other values. The value of `num` is the next element in `arr` after the previously processed element.

After executing the code, the count of `num` in `frequency_table` will be incremented by 1. If `num` was not in `frequency_table`, it will be added with a count of 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the count of `num` incremented by 1, and `num` is the next element in `arr` after the previously processed element.**
