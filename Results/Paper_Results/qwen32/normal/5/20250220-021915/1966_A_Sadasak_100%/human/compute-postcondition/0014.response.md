Output State: **`frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `arr` and the corresponding value is the count of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `frequency_table` will have each unique number from the list `arr` as keys, and the values will represent how many times each number appears in `arr`, but no more than `k` times.
