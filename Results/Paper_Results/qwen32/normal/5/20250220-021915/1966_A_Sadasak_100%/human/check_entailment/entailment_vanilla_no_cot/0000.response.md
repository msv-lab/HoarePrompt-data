Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the allowed operations. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Frequencies**: The function `func_1` truncates the frequency of any card to `k`, which is not the correct approach. The frequency should be counted accurately without truncation.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards**: The logic in the main part of the program to determine the minimum number of cards is flawed. It checks if `k` is in the frequency values, which is not a valid condition for determining the minimum number of cards. 

3. **Lack of Proper Reduction Logic**: The program does not implement the correct logic to simulate the process of exchanging `k` cards for `k-1` cards. It needs to repeatedly reduce the counts of the most frequent cards until no more exchanges can be made.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Sort frequencies in descending order
    freq_values = sorted(freq.values(), reverse=True)
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
    remaining_cards = 0
    for count in freq_values:
        while count >= k:
            count -= k - 1
        remaining_cards += count
    
    print(remaining_cards)
```

This corrected program accurately counts the frequency of each card, sorts these frequencies in descending order, and then reduces the counts by repeatedly exchanging `k` cards for `k-1` cards until no more exchanges can be made. The remaining counts are then summed to get the minimum number of cards left.
