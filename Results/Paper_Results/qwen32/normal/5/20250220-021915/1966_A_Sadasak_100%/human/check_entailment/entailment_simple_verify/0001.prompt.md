You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding
The problem asks us to repeatedly exchange groups of `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards with any numbers, with the goal of minimizing the number of cards left in the end.

### Key Points
1. **Exchange Operation**: We can exchange any `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards with any numbers.
2. **Objective**: Minimize the number of cards remaining in the hand.

### Strategy
1. **Count Frequencies**: Determine the frequency of each card number.
2. **Exchange Groups**: For each card number with a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, we can repeatedly exchange groups of `k` cards for `k-1` cards.
3. **Calculate Remaining Cards**: After performing the exchanges, calculate the number of cards remaining.

### Analysis of the Provided Program
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, and the number of cards remains `n`.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the frequency of each card number but truncates the frequency to `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is incorrect because we need the actual frequencies to determine how many exchanges can be made.

4. **Logic for Determining Minimum Cards**:
   - The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if true. This is also incorrect because:
     - The value `k` in the frequency table does not necessarily mean that we can achieve `k-1` cards.
     - The program does not correctly account for the number of exchanges that can be made based on the actual frequencies.

### Correct Approach
- **Calculate Actual Frequencies**: Use a dictionary to count the actual number of occurrences of each card number.
- **Perform Exchanges**: For each card number with frequency `f`, compute the number of exchanges as `f // k` and the remaining cards as `f % k`.
- **Sum Remaining Cards**: Sum the remaining cards for all card numbers to get the minimum number of cards left.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed exchanges. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
