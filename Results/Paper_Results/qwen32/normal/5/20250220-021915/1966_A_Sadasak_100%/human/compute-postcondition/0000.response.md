The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary named `frequency_table`. This action does not affect the values of `arr` or `k`. The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers and `k` is an integer within specific ranges. Since `frequency_table` is newly introduced and initialized as an empty dictionary, it is the only variable that has changed.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, and `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.**
