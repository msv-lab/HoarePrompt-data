The code increments the count of `num` in the `frequency_table` dictionary by 1. If `num` is not already a key in the dictionary, it is added with an initial count of 1. The values of `arr`, `k`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num`'s count incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `arr` after the previously processed element.**
