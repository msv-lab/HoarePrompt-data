Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` where the first element `t` indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the lengths of sticks. The function returns the sum of the integer divisions of the frequency of each stick length by 3 across all test cases.**
