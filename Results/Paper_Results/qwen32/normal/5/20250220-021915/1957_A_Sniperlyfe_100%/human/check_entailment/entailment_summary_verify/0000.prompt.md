You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 3 for v in freq.values()))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a list `arr` where the first element `t` indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the lengths of sticks. The function calculates and returns the sum of the integer divisions of the frequency of each unique stick length by 3 across all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from the given sticks. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that a regular polygon can be formed with at least 3 sides and that each polygon requires exactly 3 sticks of the same length. This assumption is incorrect because regular polygons can have more than 3 sides, and the number of sticks required to form a polygon is equal to the number of its sides.

For example, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
With 6 sticks of length 2, you can form 2 equilateral triangles (each triangle requires 3 sticks).

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
2
```

In this case, the program happens to produce the correct output, but this is not due to correct logic. The program is only correct by chance because it is using integer division by 3, which happens to work for this specific input. However, this logic fails for other cases where the number of sticks per polygon is greater than 3.

Let's consider another test case:

**Input:**
```
1
9
4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
With 9 sticks of length 4, you can form 3 squares (each square requires 4 sticks).

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
3
```

Again, the program produces the correct output by chance, but this is not due to correct logic. The program would fail for a test case where the number of sticks per polygon is greater than 3 and not a multiple of 3.

**Counterexample:**

**Input:**
```
1
8
5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
With 8 sticks of length 5, you can form 2 octagons (each octagon requires 8 sticks).

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
2
```

The program would incorrectly output `2` because it uses integer division by 3, which is not the correct logic for determining the number of polygons that can be formed. The correct logic should determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by checking the number of sticks required for polygons with 3 or more sides.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the general case of forming regular polygons with more than 3 sides.
