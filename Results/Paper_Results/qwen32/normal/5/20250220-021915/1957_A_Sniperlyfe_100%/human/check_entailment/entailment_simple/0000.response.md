### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks, where each side of a polygon must be exactly one stick and no stick can be reused.

However, the provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to solve this problem. Specifically, the function calculates the sum of the integer divisions of each stick count by 3, which does not accurately determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed for each stick length. For a given stick length, we can form a regular polygon if we have at least as many sticks as the number of sides of the polygon. The smallest regular polygon is a triangle (3 sides), so we should start by checking if we can form triangles, then squares, and so on, until we can no longer form a regular polygon with the available sticks of that length.

The current implementation incorrectly assumes that we only need to check for triangles (dividing the count of each stick length by 3), which is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly for all possible regular polygons.

### Correctness:
