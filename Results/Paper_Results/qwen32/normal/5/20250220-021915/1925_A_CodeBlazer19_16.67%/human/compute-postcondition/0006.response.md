The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 97 to `k + 97`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 97. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be the next value in the range, which is 98.

State: **`t` is an integer provided by the input such that 1 <= t <= 676; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `s` is the string 'a', `j` is 98**
