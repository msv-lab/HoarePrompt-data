The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is in the range from 97 to `k + 97 - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 98. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, making it 99, and `k + 97` should be greater than 99 to ensure the loop can continue.

State: **`t` is an integer provided by the input such that 1 <= t <= 676; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `s` is the string 'ab'; `j` is 99**
