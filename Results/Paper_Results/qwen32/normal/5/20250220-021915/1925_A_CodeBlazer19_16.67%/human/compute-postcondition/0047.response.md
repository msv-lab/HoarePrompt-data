The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`. The constraints are that `t` is between 1 and 676, `n` is between 1 and 26, and `k` is between 1 and 26. The functionality of the function is to process each test case with the given `n` and `k` and return a specific result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where `1 <= n <= 26` and `1 <= k <= 26`. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
