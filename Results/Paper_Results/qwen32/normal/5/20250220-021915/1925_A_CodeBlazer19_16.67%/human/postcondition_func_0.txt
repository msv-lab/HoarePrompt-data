The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. It constructs a string `s` containing the first `k` letters of the alphabet and prints the string `n` times if `k` is 1, or prints the string twice if `n` is greater than 1 and once if `n` is 1.
