### Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to determine if it is possible to have a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Logic for Each Test Case**:
   - If `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes), the program outputs "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it outputs "No".

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - To build a tower with `m` cubes, Nikita needs at least `m` moves. If `n >= m`, it is possible for Nikita to add exactly `m` cubes in `n` moves (by adding one cube per move for `m` moves and not removing any cubes). Therefore, the output "Yes" is correct in this case.
   - If `n < m`, it is impossible for Nikita to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, since the maximum number of cubes he can add is `n`. Therefore, the output "No" is correct in this case.

4. **Annotated Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called `t` times, once for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program correctly reads `n` and `m` and checks the condition `n >= m`.
   - Based on the condition, it prints "Yes" or "No" as required.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly determines if it's possible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves by checking if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
Correctness: **True**
