### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program does not handle all possible cases correctly. The logic in the `func_1` function is indeed flawed. The program checks if `n >= m` and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise it prints "No". However, this logic is not sufficient because it does not account for the requirement that the difference `n - m` must be even for Nikita to be able to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Basic Case Handling**:
   - If `n < m`, it is impossible for Nikita to end up with `m` cubes because he can only add or remove one cube per move, and he cannot add more cubes than the number of moves he has.
   - If `n >= m`, it is possible for Nikita to end up with `m` cubes only if `n - m` is even. This is because any excess cubes (i.e., `n - m` cubes) must be added and then removed in pairs to ensure that the final number of cubes is `m`.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - For `n = 3` and `m = 3`, the program correctly prints "Yes" because `n >= m` and `n - m = 0` (which is even).
   - For `n = 2` and `m = 4`, the program correctly prints "No" because `n < m`.
   - For `n = 5` and `m = 3`, the program incorrectly prints "Yes" because `n >= m` but `n - m = 2` (which is even), but the original program does not account for this even difference check.

3. **Corrected Logic**:
   - The corrected version of the program checks both `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` to determine if it is possible for Nikita to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw in the program's logic. Therefore, the final evaluation is that the given program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
