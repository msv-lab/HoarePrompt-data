Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible for Nikita to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed because it only checks if `n >= m` and does not consider whether the difference `n - m` is even. 

For Nikita to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, `n` must be at least `m` (i.e., `n >= m`), and the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) changes the number of cubes by 0, and any remaining moves must be additions if `n - m` is positive and even.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program simply checks if `n >= m` and does not account for the parity of `n - m`. Therefore, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
