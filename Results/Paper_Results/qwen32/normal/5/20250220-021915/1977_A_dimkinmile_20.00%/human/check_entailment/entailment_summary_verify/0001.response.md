Let's analyze the provided program and the reasoning in the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis
Nikita can perform two types of moves:
1. Add exactly 1 cube to the tower.
2. Remove exactly 1 cube from the tower.

We need to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, starting from 0 cubes.

### Key Observations:
1. **Parity (Odd/Even Nature)**: 
   - If `n` is even, the final number of cubes `m` must also be even. This is because starting from 0 cubes, an even number of moves will always result in an even number of cubes.
   - If `n` is odd, the final number of cubes `m` can be either even or odd. This is because starting from 0 cubes, an odd number of moves will always result in an odd number of cubes.

2. **Range of Possible `m` Values**:
   - The minimum value of `m` you can achieve is `0` (by only removing cubes, if possible).
   - The maximum value of `m` you can achieve is `n` (by only adding cubes).

### Correct Condition:
Given the above points, the correct condition should be:
- If `n` is even, `m` must be even and `0 <= m <= n`.
- If `n` is odd, `m` can be any value such that `0 <= m <= n`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks only if `n >= m` and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise "No". This logic is not fully correct because it does not account for the parity requirement.

### Example Analysis:
- For `n = 5` and `m = 3`:
  - `n` is odd, so `m` can be any value from `0` to `5`. Thus, the answer should be "Yes".
- For `n = 2` and `m = 4`:
  - `n` is even, so `m` must be even and `0 <= m <= 2`. Thus, the answer should be "No".

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in pointing out that the program does not account for the parity requirement. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the general case as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
