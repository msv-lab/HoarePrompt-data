Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times. `count_a` is a dictionary where each unique integer from the list `a` is a key, and its value is the number of times that integer appears in `a`. If `num` is in `count_a`, then `max_score` is 1 if `count_a[num]` is equal to 2, otherwise `max_score` remains 0. If `num` is not in `count_a`, `max_score` remains 0. `n` is greater than or equal to 1.**
