The code snippet `count_a[num] += 1` increments the count of the key `num` in the dictionary `count_a` by 1. 

Given that `num` is the next element in the list `a` and `count_a` already contains the key `num`, the value associated with `num` in `count_a` will be incremented by 1. If `num` was not already a key in `count_a`, it will be added with a value of 1.

Thus, the updated state will reflect that the count of `num` in `count_a` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` must have at least one element. `count_a` is a dictionary where the key `num` has been incremented by 1. `num` is the next element in the list `a`.**
