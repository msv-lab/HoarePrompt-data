The code snippet `count_a[num] = 1` sets the value of the key `num` in the dictionary `count_a` to 1. This means that if `num` was already a key in `count_a`, its value is now 1. If `num` was not a key in `count_a`, it is added with the value 1.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` must have at least one element. `count_a` is a dictionary where the key `num` is present with the value 1, and `num` is the next element in the list `a`.**
