Output State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times. `count_a` is a dictionary where each unique integer from the list `a` is a key, and its value is the number of times that integer appears in `a`. If `num` is in `count_a`, then `max_score` is 2 if `count_a[num]` is equal to 2, otherwise `max_score` is 1. If `num` is not in `count_a`, `max_score` is 1. `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `num` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The value of `max_score` has been incremented by 1. If `num` was already in `count_a` and `count_a[num]` was 2, `max_score` is now 2. If `count_a[num]` was not 2, `max_score` is now 1. If `num` was not in `count_a`, `max_score` is also now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
