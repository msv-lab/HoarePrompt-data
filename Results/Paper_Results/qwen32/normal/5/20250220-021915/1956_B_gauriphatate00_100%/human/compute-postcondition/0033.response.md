Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function returns `max_score`, which is the number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 2 times in the list `a`.**
