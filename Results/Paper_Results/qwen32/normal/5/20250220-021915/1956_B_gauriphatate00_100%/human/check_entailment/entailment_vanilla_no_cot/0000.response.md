Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally. The current implementation only counts the number of pairs of cards you have, which does not consider the optimal strategy for both players.

The strategy should involve considering the optimal moves for both you and Nene. Specifically, you should aim to maximize your points while Nene aims to maximize her points and minimize your points. The current implementation does not account for the interaction between your moves and Nene's optimal responses.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to simulate the game or use a strategy that considers the optimal play for both players. One possible approach is to use a greedy strategy or dynamic programming to determine the best moves for each player, taking into account the current state of the table and the cards each player has.
