To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for num in range(1, n + 1)`. The only variables involved here are `num` and `n`.

Let's analyze the conditions for the loop to execute:
- The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 because `range(1, n + 1)` will generate at least one value (1) if `n` is 1 or more.
- The variable `num` will be automatically assigned values from the range during each iteration, so we do not need to adjust its initial state explicitly before the loop starts.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times.
- `count_a` is a dictionary where each unique integer from the list `a` is a key, and its value is the number of times that integer appears in `a`.
- `max_score` is 0.

None of these variables (`a`, `count_a`, `max_score`) are directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The only requirement is that `n` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state to ensure the loop executes is:
State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where each unique integer from the list `a` is a key, and its value is the number of times that integer appears in `a`, `max_score` is 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
