Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5. `a` must have at least one element. `count_a` is a dictionary where the key `num` is present. If `num` was already in `count_a`, its value has been incremented by 1. If `num` was not in `count_a` before, it is now added with a value of 1.**
