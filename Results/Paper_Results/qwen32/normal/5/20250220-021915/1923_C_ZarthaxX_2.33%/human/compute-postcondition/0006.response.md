The code updates the value of `sum[i]` using the formula `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `sum[i - 1]` is `sum[0]`, which is 0 (as per the initial state). Therefore, the new value of `sum[1]` will be `0 + nums[0] - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of n integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input; `ones` is a list of n + 1 integers where `ones[1]` is 1 if `nums[0]` is 1, else `ones[1]` is 0; `sum` is a list of n + 1 integers where `sum[1]` is `nums[0] - 1` and other elements are 0; `i` is 1**.
