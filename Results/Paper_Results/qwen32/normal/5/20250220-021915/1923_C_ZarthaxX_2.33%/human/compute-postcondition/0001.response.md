The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string values, converts each of these string values to an integer, and stores them in a list named `nums`. The variables `t`, `n`, `q`, and `c` are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of n integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
