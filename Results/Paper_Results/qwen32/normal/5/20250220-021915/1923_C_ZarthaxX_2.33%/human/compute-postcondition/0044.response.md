The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides a detailed description of various variables and their relationships, but these details are not directly relevant to the execution of the `print('YES')` statement.

Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'YES'`, the actual values of variables like `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `onesInRange`, and `sumInRange` do not influence the output of this particular print statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print('YES')` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
