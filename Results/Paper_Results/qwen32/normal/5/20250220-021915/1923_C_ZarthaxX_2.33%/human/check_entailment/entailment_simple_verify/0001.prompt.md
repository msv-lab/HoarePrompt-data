You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks us to determine if a given subarray is "good" based on the following conditions:

1. The sum of the subarray should be equal to the sum of another array `b` of the same length.
2. No element in the subarray should be equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
3. All elements in `b` should be positive.

### Key Observations

For a subarray to be "good":
- The sum of the subarray `c[l:r+1]` should be equal to the sum of `b`, which can be any positive integers different from `c[l:r+1]`.
- To ensure that `a_i != b_i` for every index `i`, we need at least one element in `c[l:r+1]` to be different from `b_i`. This implies that the subarray should not consist of all `1`s because if all elements are `1`, we cannot create `b` with all positive integers different from `1`.
- The condition `b_i > 0` is inherently satisfied as long as we ensure `b_i != a_i`.

### Solution Analysis

Let's analyze the provided solution:

1. **Prefix Arrays Construction:**
   - `ones[i]` keeps the count of `1`s up to index `i` in the array.
   - `sum[i]` keeps the sum of the array up to index `i` minus the number of elements in that range (since we subtract `1` for each element).

2. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the number of `1`s in the subarray and the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is used to determine if the subarray can be "good". This condition essentially checks if we can construct an array `b` that meets the criteria.

### Correctness of the Solution

Let's verify if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is correct:

- `onesInRange` is the count of `1`s in the subarray.
- `sumInRange` is the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements.
- `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` simplifies to `onesInRange + (r - l + 1)`.
- This condition checks if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements is at least the count of `1`s plus the length of the subarray. This ensures that there is enough "space" to adjust the elements to form `b` without violating the conditions.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. The condition used in the solution is derived from the requirement that the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` that meets the criteria.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
