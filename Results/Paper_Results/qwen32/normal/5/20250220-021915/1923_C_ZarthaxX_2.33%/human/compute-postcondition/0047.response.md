Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, q is 0, c is a list of n integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9, nums is a list of integers derived from the input, ones is a list of n + 1 integers where ones[i] is the count of 1s in the first i-1 elements of nums, sum is a list of n + 1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i-1 elements of nums minus i-1, i is n.**

**Description in Natural Language:** After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `q` will be 0 because the loop runs `q` times and each iteration reduces `q` by 1 until it reaches 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body.
