Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in the first `i-1` elements of `nums`; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i-1` elements of `nums` minus `i-1`; `i` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
    if l == r:
        print('NO')
        continue
    onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
    sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
    if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input, `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in the first `i-1` elements of `nums`, `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i-1` elements of `nums` minus `i-1`, `i` is `n`, `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `l` equals `r`, no further changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` determines whether the if part or the else part is executed. If this condition holds true, the if part is executed, and if it does not hold true, the else part is executed, indicating that the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange` is true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 0 <= q <= 3 * 10^5, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input, `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in the first `i-1` elements of `nums`, `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i-1` elements of `nums` minus `i-1`, `i` is `n`, `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `l` equals `r`, no further changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` determines whether the if part or the else part is executed. If this condition holds true, the if part is executed; otherwise, the else part is executed, indicating that the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange` is true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 0 <= q - 1 <= 3 * 10^5, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input, `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in the first `i-1` elements of `nums`, `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i-1` elements of `nums` minus `i-1`, `i` is `n`, `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
