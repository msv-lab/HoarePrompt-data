The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`. The values of `t`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, and `sum` do not directly affect whether the loop will execute or not. 

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` should be initialized to 1 before the loop starts. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of n integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input; `ones` is a list of n + 1 integers where each element is 0; `sum` is a list of n + 1 integers where each element is 0; `i` is 1**
