Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins. According to the problem description and the optimal play strategy, if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win; if it is even, Bob will win. The program correctly implements this logic by checking the count of 'U' in the input string and appending the appropriate result ('yes' or 'no') to the results list, which is then printed.
