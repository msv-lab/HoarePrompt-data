To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the context provided.

Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 0 (though `t` is not directly used in the provided code snippet, it's part of the precondition).
- `n` is the integer value provided by the user input for the last test case.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D" for the last test case.
- `results` is a non-empty list containing either the string `'yes'` or `'no'` for each test case depending on whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding `arr` is odd or even.
- `arr` is the string provided by the user input for the last test case.
- `results` must have at least one more element for `i` to iterate over.

The `print(i)` statement is the only line of code provided, and it implies that `i` is a variable that has been defined somewhere in the code before this `print` statement. However, the specific value of `i` is not provided directly in the initial state. 

Given that `results` has at least one more element for `i` to iterate over, we can infer that `i` is likely used in a loop that iterates over the `results` list. Typically, `i` would be the loop counter.

Assuming a common loop structure, `i` would take on values from 0 to `len(results) - 1`. However, without the exact loop structure, we can only describe `i` in terms of its role in the iteration over `results`.

Since the problem asks for the most precise description possible, we can assume that `i` is the loop index for the last iteration over `results`, which would be `len(results) - 1`.

Output: **i (where i is the loop index for the last iteration over the `results` list, specifically `len(results) - 1`)**
