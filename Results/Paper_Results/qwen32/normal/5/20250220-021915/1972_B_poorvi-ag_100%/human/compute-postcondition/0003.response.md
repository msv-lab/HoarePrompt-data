In the provided code snippet, the variable `n` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())`. This means `n` will take on the integer value provided by the user input. The initial state specifies that `n` was already a single integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, but this value is overwritten by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `results`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0**.
