The code snippet provided appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. No other variables are modified. Therefore, the value of `results` is updated to include the additional string `'no'`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `results` is a list containing either the string `'yes'` or `'no'` and now also contains `'no'`, `i` is 2, `arr` is the new string provided by the user input.**
