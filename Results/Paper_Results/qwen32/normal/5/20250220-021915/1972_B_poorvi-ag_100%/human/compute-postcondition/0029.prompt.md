Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input for the last test case, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D" for the last test case, `results` is a list containing either the string `'yes'` or `'no'` for each test case depending on whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding `arr` is odd or even, `i` is `t-1`, `arr` is the string provided by the user input for the last test case.
Code of the loop:
for i in results:
    print(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input for the last test case, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D" for the last test case, `results` is a non-empty list containing either the string `'yes'` or `'no'` for each test case depending on whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding `arr` is odd or even, `i` is `t-1`, `arr` is the string provided by the user input for the last test case

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input for the last test case, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D" for the last test case, `results` is a non-empty list containing either the string `'yes'` or `'no'` for each test case depending on whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding `arr` is odd or even, `arr` is the string provided by the user input for the last test case

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input for the last test case, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D" for the last test case, `results` is a non-empty list containing either the string `'yes'` or `'no'` for each test case depending on whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding `arr` is odd or even, `arr` is the string provided by the user input for the last test case, and `results` must have at least one more element for `i` to iterate over.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
