The given code snippet only initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are modified, and no computations are performed. Therefore, the state of `t`, `n`, and `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `n` is a single integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D"; `results` is an empty list.**
