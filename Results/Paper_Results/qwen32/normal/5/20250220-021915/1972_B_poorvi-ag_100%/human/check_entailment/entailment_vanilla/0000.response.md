Reasoning:
The problem can be analyzed by focusing on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the initial configuration. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Game Dynamics and Parity**: 
   - Each operation involves removing a facing-up coin and flipping the two adjacent coins. 
   - If the adjacent coins were both facing down, they will both become facing up, increasing the count of facing-up coins by 2 (which does not change the parity).
   - If one adjacent coin was facing up and the other facing down, the facing-up coin will become facing down, and the facing-down coin will become facing up, leaving the count of facing-up coins unchanged (parity remains the same).
   - If both adjacent coins were facing up, they will both become facing down, decreasing the count of facing-up coins by 2 (which does not change the parity).

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - The game ends when there are no facing-up coins left. The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - For Alice to win, she must be the one to make the last move, leaving Bob with no facing-up coins.
   - Therefore, if the initial number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always leave Bob with an even number of facing-up coins after her turn, and eventually, Bob will be the one to face a situation with no facing-up coins left.
   - Conversely, if the initial number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice is the one to face a situation with no facing-up coins left.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The key observation is that the parity of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice wins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob wins.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the number of 'U's in the input string for each test case and appending 'yes' or 'no' to the results list based on whether the count is odd or even, respectively.

Correctness: **True**
