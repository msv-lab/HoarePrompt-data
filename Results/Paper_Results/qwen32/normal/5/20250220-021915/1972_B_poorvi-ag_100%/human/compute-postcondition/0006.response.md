The code snippet `results.append('yes')` appends the string `'yes'` to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `results` is a list containing the string `'yes'`, `i` is 0, `arr` is the string provided by the user input, and the current value of `arr.count('U')` is odd.**
