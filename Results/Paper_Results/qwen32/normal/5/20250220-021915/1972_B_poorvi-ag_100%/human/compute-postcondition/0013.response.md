Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `results` is a list containing either the string `'yes'` or `'no'` and now also contains `'yes'`, `i` is 1, `arr` is the new string provided by the user input.**

In simple terms, the only change is that the `results` list now includes an additional `'yes'` at the end. All other variables remain unchanged.
