To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

1. **t**: Must be greater than or equal to 0.
2. **n**: The integer value provided by the user input for the last test case.
3. **s**: A string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D" for the last test case.
4. **results**: A non-empty list containing either the string `'yes'` or `'no'` for each test case depending on whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding `arr` is odd or even.
5. **i**: Defined as `t-1`.
6. **arr**: The string provided by the user input for the last test case.

The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is defined as `t-1`. Since `t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` will be greater than or equal to -1.

However, the exact value of `t` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `i`. Nevertheless, we can describe the value of `i` in terms of `t`.

Output: **i (where i is t-1 and t is the input value for the number of test cases)**
