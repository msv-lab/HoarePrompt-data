Output State: **The program returns the value of `count` plus 1 if `balance` is greater than 0, otherwise it returns `count`.**

In simpler terms, the program returns the number of times `balance` was reset to 0 due to becoming negative, plus an additional 1 if `balance` is positive after processing all characters in `expression`.
