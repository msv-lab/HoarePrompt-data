You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting of characters '+' and '-', and length is an integer such that length = len(expression) and 1 <= length <= 5000.
def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance < 0:
            count += 1
            balance = 0
        
    #State: - `count` will be the number of times `balance` was reset to 0 due to becoming negative.
    #- `balance` will be the net balance after processing all characters in `expression`.
    #
    #To determine the exact final values of `count` and `balance`, we would need the specific string `expression`. However, based on the behavior described, the final state after the loop completes can be summarized as follows:
    #
    #Output State:
    return count + (balance > 0)
    #The program returns the value of `count` plus 1 if `balance` is greater than 0, otherwise it returns `count`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `expression`, which is a string consisting of characters '+' and '-', and a parameter `length`, which is an integer representing the length of the `expression`. The function returns the value of `count` plus 1 if `balance` is greater than 0; otherwise, it returns `count`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `count` plus 1 if `balance` is greater than 0, otherwise it returns `count`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
