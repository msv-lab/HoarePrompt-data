The code increments the `balance` variable by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `expression` is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters '+' and '-', `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `count` is 0, `balance` is 1, and the current character `char` is '+'.
