### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty for the given problem. The logic in the function `func_1` does not account for the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the total penalty. The function simply counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end, which does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the sum of penalties of the subarrays.

Let's break down why the provided code is incorrect:

1. **Function Logic**:
    - The function `func_1` calculates a `count` of how many times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end.
    - This logic does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.
    - The penalty is defined as the absolute value of the sum of a subarray multiplied by its length. The function does not account for this calculation.

2. **Example Analysis**:
    - Consider the example input `+-++--`:
        - The optimal split is `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`.
        - The penalty for each subarray is `|1 - 1| * 2 = 0`.
        - The total penalty is `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`.
    - The provided function would not produce this result and would likely produce an incorrect result.

3. **Annotations**:
    - The annotations describe the state of the program before and after the function call.
    - The annotations indicate that `count` will be the number of times `balance` was reset to 0 due to becoming negative, and `balance` will be the net balance after processing all characters in `expression`.
    - However, this does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the total penalty.

Based on the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate, and the provided program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
