### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` into subarrays such that the sum of penalties is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It then splits the string `s` by the character `'-'` and calculates the sum of lengths of the resulting parts.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1` with the string `s` and the calculated length, and prints the result.

3. **Understanding `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` iterates through the string `s`, maintaining a `balance` counter that increases for `'+'` and decreases for `'-'`.
   - It increments a `count` variable each time the `balance` becomes negative, resetting the `balance` to zero.
   - After the loop, it adds 1 to `count` if the final `balance` is positive.
   - The function returns `count + (balance > 0)`.

4. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the total penalty.
   - The function simply counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end. This does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize penalties.
   - The function does not attempt to find the optimal splits that would minimize the penalties as described in the problem statement.

5. **Counterexample:**
   - The provided counterexample in the original assessment demonstrates that the function does not produce the correct result.
   - For the input `'+-++--'`, the optimal split is `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, which results in a total penalty of `0`.
   - The function would likely produce a different result, indicating that it is not solving the problem correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic required to find the optimal splits that minimize the total penalty. The original assessment is accurate in identifying this issue.

**Final: False**
