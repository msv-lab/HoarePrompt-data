Output State: **`expression` is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters '+' and '-', `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`. `char` is the next character in `expression`. If `balance` is less than 0, then `count` is set to 1 and `balance` is set to 0. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 and `balance` retains its original value. `balance` is increased by 1.**

Natural language: The value of `balance` is increased by 1. All other variables (`expression`, `length`, `char`, `count`) remain unchanged.
