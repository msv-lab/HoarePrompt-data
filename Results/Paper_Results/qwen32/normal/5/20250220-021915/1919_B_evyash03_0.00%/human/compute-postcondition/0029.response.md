Postcondition: **`expression` is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters '+' and '-', `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `char` is the next character in `expression`. If `balance` was originally less than 0, then `count` is incremented by 1 and `balance` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `char` is '+', `balance` is incremented by 1. If `char` is '-', `balance` is decremented by 1. If `char` is neither '+' nor '-', `count` and `balance` retain their original values.**
