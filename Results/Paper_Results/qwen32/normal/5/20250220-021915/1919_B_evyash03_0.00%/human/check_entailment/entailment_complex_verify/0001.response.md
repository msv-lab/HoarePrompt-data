### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program and concludes that the program is incorrect. Let's systematically review the annotations and the code to confirm this assessment.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The task is to split a string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - The initial splitting using `expression.split('-')` is incorrect because it does not contribute to finding the optimal subarrays. This step is irrelevant to the problem.
   - The function `func_1` attempts to count the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end. This approach does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty.

3. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations describe the state of the program before the function call and after the loop in `func_1`.
   - The annotations correctly state that `count` will be the number of times `balance` was reset to 0 due to becoming negative, and `balance` will be the net balance after processing all characters in `expression`.
   - The final return value of `func_1` is `count + (balance > 0)`, which is not the correct way to compute the minimum penalty.

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly split the string into subarrays to minimize the penalty.
   - The function `func_1` does not account for the actual penalties of the subarrays. It only counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve the problem correctly, a more sophisticated algorithm is needed. One approach is to use a greedy strategy that keeps track of the balance and splits the array optimally to minimize the penalty.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program fails to find the optimal splits and does not compute the minimum penalty correctly.

**Final: False**
