The code snippet initializes a variable `count` to 0. This does not affect the values of `expression` or `length`, which remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters '+' and '-', and `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and 1 <= `length` <= 5000; `count` is 0.**
