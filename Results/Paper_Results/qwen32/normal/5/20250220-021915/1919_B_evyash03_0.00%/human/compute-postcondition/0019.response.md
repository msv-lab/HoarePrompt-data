The code snippet `count += 1` simply increments the value of the variable `count` by 1. The other variables (`expression`, `length`, `char`, and `balance`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the only change in the output state is the value of `count`.

Output State: **`expression` is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters '+' and '-', `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`. `char` is the next character in `expression`. If `char` is '+', `balance` is increased by 1. If `char` is '-', and `balance` was originally 0 or positive, `count` is set to 1 and `balance` is set to 0. If `char` is '-' and `balance` was already negative, `balance` is decreased by 1. If `char` is not '-', `count` remains 0 and `balance` retains its original value. If `balance` is less than 0 at any point, `count` is set to 1 and `balance` is set to 0. `count` is incremented by 1.**
