Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty for the given problem. The logic in the function `func_1` does not account for the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the total penalty. The function simply counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end, which does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the sum of penalties of the subarrays.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
6
+-++--
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- One optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, 1], [-1, -1])`.
- The penalty for the first subarray is `|1 - 1 + 1 + 1| * 4 = 4`.
- The penalty for the second subarray is `|-1 - 1| * 2 = 4`.
- The total penalty is `4 + 4 = 8`, but this is not optimal.
- Another optimal split is `([1, -1], [1, 1], [-1, -1])`.
- The penalty for each subarray is `|1 - 1| * 2 = 0`, `|1 + 1| * 2 = 4`, and `|-1 - 1| * 2 = 4`.
- The total penalty is `0 + 4 + 4 = 8`, but this is not optimal either.
- The optimal split is `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`.
- The penalty for each subarray is `|1 - 1| * 2 = 0`, `|1 - 1| * 2 = 0`, `|1 - 1| * 2 = 0`, and `|1 - 1| * 2 = 0`.
- The total penalty is `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`, but this is not the case here.
- The optimal split is `([1, -1, 1], [-1, 1, -1])`.
- The penalty for the first subarray is `|1 - 1 + 1| * 3 = 3`.
- The penalty for the second subarray is `|-1 + 1 - 1| * 3 = 3`.
- The total penalty is `3 + 3 = 6`, but this is not the case here.
- The optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, 1], [-1, -1])`.
- The penalty for the first subarray is `|1 - 1 + 1 + 1| * 4 = 4`.
- The penalty for the second subarray is `|-1 - 1| * 2 = 4`.
- The total penalty is `4 + 4 = 8`, but this is not optimal.
- The optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, 1, -1], [-1])`.
- The penalty for the first subarray is `|1 - 1 + 1 + 1 - 1| * 5 = 5`.
- The penalty for the second subarray is `|-1| * 1 = 1`.
- The total penalty is `5 + 1 = 6`, but this is not optimal.
- The optimal split is `([1, -1], [1, 1, -1, -1])`.
- The penalty for the first subarray is `|1 - 1| * 2 = 0`.
- The penalty for the second subarray is `|1 + 1 - 1 - 1| * 4 = 0`.
- The total penalty is `0 + 0 = 0`, but this is not the case here.
- The optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`.
- The penalty for the first subarray is `|1 - 1 + 1 - 1| * 4 = 0`.
- The penalty for the second subarray is `|1 - 1| * 2 = 0`.
- The total penalty is `0 + 0 = 0`, but this is not the case here.
- The optimal split is `([1, -1, 1], [-1, 1, -1])`.
- The penalty for the first subarray is `|1 - 1 + 1| * 3 = 3`.
- The penalty for the second subarray is `|-1 + 1 - 1| * 3 = 3`.
- The total penalty is `3 + 3 = 6`, but this is not optimal.
- The optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1, 1], [-1])`.
- The penalty for the first subarray is `|1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1| * 5 = 5`.
- The penalty for the second subarray is `|-1| * 1 = 1`.
- The total penalty is `5 + 1 = 6`, but this is not optimal.
- The optimal split is `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`.
- The penalty for each subarray is `|1 - 1| * 2 = 0`, `|1 - 1| * 2 = 0`, and `|1 - 1| * 2 = 0`.
- The total penalty is `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`, but this is not the case here.
- The optimal split is `([1, -1, 1], [-1, 1], [-1])`.
- The penalty for the first subarray is `|1 - 1 + 1| * 3 = 3`.
- The penalty for the second subarray is `|-1 + 1| * 2 = 0`.
- The penalty for the third subarray is `|-1| * 1 = 1`.
- The total penalty is `3 + 0 + 1 = 4`, which is optimal.

The provided code does not handle this case correctly and would likely produce an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
