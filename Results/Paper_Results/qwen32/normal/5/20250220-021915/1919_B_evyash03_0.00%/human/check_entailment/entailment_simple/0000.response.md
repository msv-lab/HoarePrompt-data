### Reasoning:

The given Python program aims to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays, where the penalty for each subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

Let's break down the program's logic and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Splitting Logic**:
   - The program initially splits the string `s` by the character `'-'` and calculates the sum of lengths of the resulting parts. This step is not directly related to the optimal splitting process described in the problem.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes the string `s` by maintaining a `balance` variable which is incremented for each `'+'` and decremented for each `'-'`.
   - Whenever the `balance` becomes negative, it resets the `balance` to 0 and increments the `count`.
   - After processing the entire string, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`. This suggests that it counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the final balance is positive.

The logic in `func_1` is intended to count the minimum number of splits needed to ensure that no subarray has a negative sum. However, the provided logic does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty as described in the problem. The penalty involves the absolute value of the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length, which is not accounted for in the current implementation.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the third test case from the example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  6
  +-+-+-
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  0
  ```

The optimal way to split this string is into subarrays `([1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1])`, each with a penalty of `0` because the sum of each subarray is `0`. The total penalty is `0`.

However, the function `func_1` would process this string as follows:
- `balance` starts at `0`.
- `balance` becomes `1` after `'+'`.
- `balance` becomes `0` after `'-'`.
- `balance` becomes `1` after `'+'`.
- `balance` becomes `0` after `'-'`.
- `balance` becomes `1` after `'+'`.
- `balance` becomes `0` after `'-'`.

The `count` would be `0` because the balance never goes negative, and the final balance is `0`. Therefore, the function would return `0 + (0 > 0) = 0`, which is correct for this specific case.

However, consider the fourth test case:

- **Input**:
  ```
  10
  --+++++++-
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  4
  ```

The optimal way to split this string is into subarrays `([-1,-1],[1],[1],[1],[1],[1],[1],[1],[-1])`, each with a penalty of `2`, `1`, `1`, `1`, `1`, `1`, `1`, `1`, and `1` respectively. The total penalty is `4`.

The function `func_1` would process this string as follows:
- `balance` starts at `0`.
- `balance` becomes `-1` after `'-'`.
- `balance` becomes `-2` after `'-'`.
- `balance` becomes `-1` after `'+'`.
- `balance` becomes `0` after `'+'`.
- `balance` becomes `1` after `'+'`.
- `balance` becomes `2` after `'+'`.
- `balance` becomes `3` after `'+'`.
- `balance` becomes `4` after `'+'`.
- `balance` becomes `3` after `'-'`.

The `count` would be `2` because the balance goes negative twice, and the final balance is `3`. Therefore, the function would return `2 + (3 > 0) = 3`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided program's logic in `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum penalty as described in the problem. It only counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the final balance is positive, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum penalty.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
