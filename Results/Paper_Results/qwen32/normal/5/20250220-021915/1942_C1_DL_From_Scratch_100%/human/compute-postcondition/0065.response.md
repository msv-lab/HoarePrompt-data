Output State: **`T` is 1, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`, `count` is 3 if `num` is 1, otherwise `count` is 1, `n` and `y` are integers read from the input, `list0` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, `x` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `i` is `x - 2`**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1. If `num` was initially 1, `count` was 2 and is now 3. If `num` was not 1, `count` was 0 and is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
