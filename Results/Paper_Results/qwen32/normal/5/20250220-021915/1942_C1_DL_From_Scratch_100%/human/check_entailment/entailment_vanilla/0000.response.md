Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:

The task is to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing diagonals between vertices of a regular polygon. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n, and Bessie has already chosen x vertices. We can choose up to y additional vertices, but in this version (easy version), y is always 0. The output should be the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.

### Key Points:
1. **Vertices and Diagonals**: The vertices are part of a regular polygon. Diagonals can be drawn between chosen vertices to form triangles.
2. **Non-intersecting Triangles**: The triangles must not intersect with each other.
3. **Bessie's Chosen Vertices**: Bessie has already chosen x vertices, and we cannot choose any more vertices (y = 0).
4. **Counting Triangles**: The key is to count the number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using the x vertices already chosen.

### Program Analysis:

Let's go through the provided program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)
```

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `T`. For each test case, it reads the number of sides `n`, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen `x`, and `y` (which is always 0 in this version).
2. **Sorting Vertices**: The vertices chosen by Bessie are read into a list and sorted.
3. **Counting Triangles**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of vertices and checks the gap between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap between two consecutive vertices is exactly 1 (meaning they are adjacent in the polygon), it increments the `count` by 1.
   - It also checks the gap between the first and the last vertex in the sorted list, considering the polygon is circular.
4. **Output**: The program outputs `count + x - 2` for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:

The logic in the program seems flawed. The program counts the number of adjacent pairs of vertices and adds `x - 2` to this count. However, this does not correctly compute the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed.

#### Issues:
1. **Counting Triangles**: The program only counts adjacent vertices, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles.
2. **Non-intersecting Triangles**: The program does not ensure that the triangles formed are non-intersecting. For example, if the vertices are chosen in such a way that they form a star pattern, the program might incorrectly count triangles that intersect.
3. **Example Mismatch**: The program does not produce the correct output for the provided examples. For example, in the first test case, the output should be 2, but the program might not correctly compute this.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to account for the requirement of forming non-intersecting triangles and does not correctly count the maximum number of such triangles.

**Correctness: False**
