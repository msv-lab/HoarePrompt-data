The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `mid`, and `n` is the input integer.

Since the loop iterates from `mid` to `n-1`, we need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration. There is no need to adjust `n` as it remains the same throughout the loop.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `mid + 1`.

State: **`right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `count_zeros_first_half`; `leftOne` is `count_ones_first_half`; `tleftZero` is `count_zeros_first_half`; `tleftOne` is `count_ones_first_half`; `i` is `mid + 1`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is `1` and `trightZero` is `1`. Otherwise, `rightOne` is `2` and `trightOne` is `2`.**
