The code snippet `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `trightZero` by 1. Given that the initial value of `trightZero` is `3`, after the execution of the code, `trightZero` will be `4`.

The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `count_zeros_first_half`; `leftOne` is `count_ones_first_half`; `tleftZero` is `count_zeros_first_half`; `tleftOne` is `count_ones_first_half`; `i` is `mid + 2`; `rightZero` is `3`; `trightZero` is `4`. If `s[i]` is '0', `rightOne` is not defined; otherwise, `rightOne` is `3` and `trightOne` is `4`.**
