Based on the initial state provided, the variable `right` is explicitly given the value 2. The `print(right)` statement will output this value directly.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state specifies that `right` is set to 2.
2. The `print(right)` statement directly prints the value of `right`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is the value of `right`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
