Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is 2; `s` is "10"; `mid` is 1; `left` is 1; `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `left - 1` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is -1 and `rightZero` is 2, `leftOne` is 1 and `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0 and `trightZero` is 1, `tleftOne` is 1 and `trightOne` is 0. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 0 and `rightZero` is 1, `leftOne` is 0 and `rightOne` is 1, `tleftZero` is 0 and `trightZero` is 1, `tleftOne` is 1 and `trightOne` is 0.**
