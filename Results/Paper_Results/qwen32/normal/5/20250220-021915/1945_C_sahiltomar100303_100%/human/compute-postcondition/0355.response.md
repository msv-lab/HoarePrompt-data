The value of `trightZero` is decremented by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= 0`, `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`, `right` is `mid` and `mid < n`, `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2` plus 1, `trightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`, and `trightZero` is `trightZero - 1`. Additionally, the character at position `right` in the string `s` is '0'.**
