The code calculates the integer division of `n` by 2 and assigns the result to `mid`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input; `s` is a string read from input; `mid` is `n // 2`.**
