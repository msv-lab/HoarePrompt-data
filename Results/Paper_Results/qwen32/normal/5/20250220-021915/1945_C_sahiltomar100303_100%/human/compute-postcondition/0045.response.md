The given code snippet increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input such that `n` >= 2; `s` is a string read from input; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 2 and `trightZero` is 1, otherwise `rightZero` is 0 and `trightZero` is 0. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` is 2 and `trightOne` is 1, otherwise `rightOne` is 0 and `trightOne` is 0; `i` is `mid + 1`; `rightOne` is incremented by 1.**
