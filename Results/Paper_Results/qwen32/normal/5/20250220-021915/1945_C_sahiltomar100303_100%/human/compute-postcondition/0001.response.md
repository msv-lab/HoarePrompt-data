In the provided code snippet, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used in the loop body. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `_`, but since it is not used, adjusting its value does not affect the loop's execution.

However, the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The state of `t` is already given as an integer read from input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\), which ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the loop head variables. The state of `n` and `a` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4**
