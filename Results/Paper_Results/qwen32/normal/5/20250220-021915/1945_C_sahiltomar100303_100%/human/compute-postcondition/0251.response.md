Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the counts `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` remain as described in the precondition. If `right` is equal to `n`, then `trightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` with no additional changes, or `trightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`.**
