Postcondition: **`right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is at least 4; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2`; `rightOne` is less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`; `left` is `mid`; `leftMove` is 0; `s[left - 1]` is not '0'**
