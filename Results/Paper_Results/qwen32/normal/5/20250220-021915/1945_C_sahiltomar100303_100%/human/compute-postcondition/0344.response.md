Output State: **`right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is at least 4; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `left` is `mid - 2` and `left > 0`; `leftMove` is 0; `rightZero` is incremented by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is incremented by 1; if `s[left - 1]` is '0', `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2` minus 1; otherwise, `rightOne` is incremented by 1 and `leftOne` is decreased by 1; `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`; `leftZero` is decremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `leftZero` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables retain their previously described states.
