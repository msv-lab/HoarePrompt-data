Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: right is the smallest index where both tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2 and trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2 are true; n is the input integer; s is the input string; mid is n // 2; leftZero is count_zeros_first_half; leftOne is count_ones_first_half; tleftZero is count_zeros_first_half; tleftOne is count_ones_first_half; i is n - 1; rightZero is count_zeros_second_half; rightOne is count_ones_second_half; trightZero is count_zeros_second_half; trightOne is count_ones_second_half; left is mid; leftMove is 0.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is at least 4; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2` minus 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2`; `rightOne` is less than `(n - left + 1) // 2` plus 1; `left` is `mid - 1`; `leftMove` is 0; `rightZero` is incremented by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is at least 4; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `left` is `mid - 2` and `left > 0`; `leftMove` is 0; `rightZero` is incremented by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is incremented by 1; if `s[left - 1]` is '0', `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2` minus 1; otherwise, `rightOne` is incremented by 1 and `leftOne` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is at least 4; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `left` is `mid - 3` and `left > 0`; `leftMove` is 0; if `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is decremented by 1 and `rightZero` is incremented by 1; if `s[left - 1]` is '1', then `leftOne` is decremented by 1 and `rightOne` is incremented by 1; `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
