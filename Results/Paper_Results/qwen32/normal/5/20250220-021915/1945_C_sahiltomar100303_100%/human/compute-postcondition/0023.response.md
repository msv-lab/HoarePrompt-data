Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input and must be at least 2; `s` is a string read from input; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is 1; `leftZero` is 2 if the current character of `s` at index `i` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 1; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0 if the current character of `s` at index `i` is '0', otherwise `leftOne` is 1; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 2 if the current character of `s` at index `i` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` is 1; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 0 if the current character of `s` at index `i` is '0', otherwise `tleftOne` is 1; `trightOne` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `tleftZero` has been incremented by 1. If the current character of `s` at index `i` was '0', `tleftZero` was initially 1 and is now 2. If the current character of `s` at index `i` was '1', `tleftZero` was initially 0 and is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
