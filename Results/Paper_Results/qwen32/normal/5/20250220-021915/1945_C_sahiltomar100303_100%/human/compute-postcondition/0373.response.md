Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= 0`, `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`, `right` is `mid + 2` and `mid < n - 1`. If `s[right] == '0'`, then `tleftZero` is `tleftZero + 1` and if `tleftZero + 1` is not less than `(right + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2` and `trightZero` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2` and if `tleftZero` is not less than `(right + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2` minus 1, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.**
