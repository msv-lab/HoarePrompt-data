Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input such that `n` >= 2; `s` is a string read from input; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 3 and `trightZero` is 1, otherwise `rightZero` is 1 and `trightZero` is 0. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` is 2 and `trightOne` is 1, otherwise `rightOne` is 0 and `trightOne` is 0; `i` is `mid + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `rightZero` is incremented by 1, so if `s[i]` was '0', `rightZero` becomes 3 (from 2), otherwise `rightZero` becomes 1 (from 0). The values of other variables remain unchanged.
