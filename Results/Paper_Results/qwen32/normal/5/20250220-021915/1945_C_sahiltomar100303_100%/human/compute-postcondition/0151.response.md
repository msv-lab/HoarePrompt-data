Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 1; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 0; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is 1; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0; the current character at index `i` of `s` is '0'**.

Explanation: The value of `tleftZero` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
