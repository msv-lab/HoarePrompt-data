Output State: **`right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is at least 4; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `left` is `mid - 3` and `left > 0`; `leftMove` is 0; if `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is decremented by 1 and `rightZero` is incremented by 1; if `s[left - 1]` is '1', then `leftOne` is decremented by 1 and `rightOne` is incremented by 1; `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `left` is decremented by 1, so `left` changes from `mid - 2` to `mid - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
