Output State: **`right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `count_zeros_first_half`; `leftOne` is `count_ones_first_half`; `tleftZero` is `count_zeros_first_half`; `tleftOne` is `count_ones_first_half`; `i` is `mid + 2`; `rightOne` is `4`; `trightOne` is `5`.**

Natural language description: The value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1, making it 4, and `trightOne` is incremented by 1, making it 5. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the precondition.
