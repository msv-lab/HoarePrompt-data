Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input and must be at least 2; `s` is a string read from input; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 3, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 2, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is '1', then `leftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is either 1 or 2, `trightOne` is 0.**

The value of `leftZero` is incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their previous values.
