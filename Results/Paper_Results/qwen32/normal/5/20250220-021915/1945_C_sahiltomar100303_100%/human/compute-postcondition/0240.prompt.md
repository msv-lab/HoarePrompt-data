Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` after all iterations; `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` after all iterations; `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s` after all iterations; `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` after all iterations; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is `mid`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` after all iterations; `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` after all iterations; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s` after all iterations; `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` after all iterations; `left` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a string, `right` is an index within the bounds of `s` increased by 1. If `s[right - 1]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and `trightZero` is decreased by 1. If `s[right - 1]` is not '0', then `tleftOne` is increased by 1, and `trightOne` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `s` is a string, `right` is increased by 1 and must be less than `n`. If `s[right]` is '0', `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and `trightZero` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 and `trightOne` is decreased by 1. In both cases, either `tleftZero` or `trightOne` is increased to satisfy the loop condition.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `s` is a string, `right` is increased by 1 and must be less than `n-1`. If `s[right]` is '0', `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and `trightZero` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 and `trightOne` is decreased by 1. In both cases, `tleftZero` must be less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` must be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
