Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4 to ensure `mid` is greater than 2; `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1` and must still be less than `(left + 1) // 2`; `rightZero` is `rightZero + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `rightZero` has been incremented by 1. The preconditions for `n` and `leftZero` remain unchanged.
