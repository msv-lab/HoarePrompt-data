Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4 to ensure `mid` is greater than 2. If `s[left - 2]` is '0', `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is increased by 1, with `leftZero` still being less than `(left) // 2`. Otherwise, `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is increased by 1, while `leftZero` remains less than `(left) // 2`. `left` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `left` is decreased by 1. The conditions regarding `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, and the relationship with `left` are updated accordingly to reflect the new value of `left`. The other variables (`n`, `mid`, `s`, etc.) remain unchanged.
