Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is 2; `s` is "10"; `mid` is 1; `left` is 1; `leftMove` is 0; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is either 1 or 2; `leftOne` is either 0 or -1; `rightOne` is either 1 or 2; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 1; `tleftOne` is 1; `trightOne` is 0. Specifically, if `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 2 and `leftOne` is 0. Otherwise, `rightZero` is 1 and `leftOne` is -1.**
