The code snippet `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 1; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` including the current character if it is '0'; `rightZero` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 0, now incremented by 1; `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `rightOne` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 0; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` including the current character if it is '0'; `trightZero` is 2 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `trightZero` is 0, now incremented by 1; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `trightOne` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `trightOne` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`**.

In simpler terms, `rightZero` and `trightZero` are both incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
