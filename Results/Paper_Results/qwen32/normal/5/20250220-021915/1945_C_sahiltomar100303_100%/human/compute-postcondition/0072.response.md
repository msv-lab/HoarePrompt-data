The code snippet `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Given the initial state, `left` is 1, so after decrementing, `left` becomes 0. The value of `rightZero` and `leftOne` depends on the character at the index `left - 1` in the string `s`. Since `left` is now 0, we need to check `s[left - 1]` which is `s[-1]` or the last character of the string `s`.

Given that `s` is "10", the last character `s[-1]` is '0'. According to the conditions provided, if `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 2 and `leftOne` is 0. Therefore, `rightZero` is updated to 2 and `leftOne` is updated to 0.

No other variables are affected by this change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is 2; `s` is "10"; `mid` is 1; `left` is 0; `leftMove` is 0; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 2; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is either 1 or 2; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 1; `tleftOne` is 1; `trightOne` is 0.**
