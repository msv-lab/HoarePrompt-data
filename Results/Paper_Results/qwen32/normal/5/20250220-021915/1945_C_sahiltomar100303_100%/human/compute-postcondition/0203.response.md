The code snippet provided increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Therefore, the value of `rightZero` will be its previous value plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2` minus 1; `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1; `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`; `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s`; `left` is `mid - 1`.**
