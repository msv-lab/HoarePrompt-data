The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the provided code snippet. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `t` retains its initial value, and `n` is assigned the new integer value read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input**.
