The code snippet `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Given the initial conditions, the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2` is still valid after the increment, as long as the increment does not violate this condition. Since the exact values of `right` and `tleftZero` are not specified, we cannot definitively state whether the condition is still satisfied, but we can express the new state of `tleftZero`.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= 0`, `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`, `right` is `mid + 2` and `mid < n - 1`, `tleftZero` is `tleftZero + 1`, and if `tleftZero + 1` is not less than `(right + 1) // 2`, then `trightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`**.
