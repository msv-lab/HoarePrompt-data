The given initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables. The statement simply prints the string 'Bob'.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `s` is a new string input by the user.
- `a` and `b` are integers derived from splitting the string `s` by whitespace.
- The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even.
- `i` is set to 5.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is:

```python
print('Bob')
```

This statement will output the string 'Bob' irrespective of the values of `t`, `s`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

Output: **Bob**
