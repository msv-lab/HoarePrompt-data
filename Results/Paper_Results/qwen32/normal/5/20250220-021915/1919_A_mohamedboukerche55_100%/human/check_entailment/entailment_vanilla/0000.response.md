### Reasoning:

To determine the winner of the game given the rules, let's analyze the game mechanics:

1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns, starting with Alice.
   - In each turn, the player can choose to swap wallets or keep the current one.
   - After choosing, the player must remove one coin from the current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., when both wallets have 0 coins) loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will make the move that maximizes their chances of winning.
   - The key insight here is that the game is essentially about the parity (odd/even) of the total number of coins (a + b).

3. **Winning Strategy**:
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is **even**, Bob will win.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is **odd**, Alice will win.
   - This can be reasoned as follows:
     - If the total number of coins is even, Alice will always be in a position where Bob can mirror her moves and force her into a losing position.
     - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of coins for Bob, putting Bob in a losing position.

### Program Analysis:

The given program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
- It checks the parity of the sum of coins (a + b).
- If the sum is even, it prints "Bob", otherwise, it prints "Alice".

Since the program correctly follows the optimal strategy derived from the game mechanics, it is correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
