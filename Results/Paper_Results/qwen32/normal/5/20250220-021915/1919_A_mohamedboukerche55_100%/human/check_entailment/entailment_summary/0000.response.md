### Reasoning:

The given problem can be analyzed using the concept of game theory, specifically the idea of a "winning" and "losing" position. In this game, the losing position is when a player is forced to make a move when both wallets are empty. The game can be reduced to understanding the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of coins in both wallets.

Here's the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Base Case**: If the sum of coins in both wallets (a + b) is 1, Alice will take the only coin and win because Bob will have no coins left to play with.
2. **General Case**: If the sum of coins is even, Alice will always be able to force Bob into a position where the sum of coins is odd, and vice versa. This is because:
   - If Alice starts with an even sum, she can always make a move that results in an odd sum for Bob.
   - If Bob starts with an odd sum, he can always make a move that results in an even sum for Alice.
3. **Winning Strategy**:
   - If the sum of coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position. This is because she can always make the sum even after her move, and eventually, she can force Bob to play with an odd sum, leading to his loss.
   - If the sum of coins is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position. This is because he can always make the sum odd after his move, and eventually, he can force Alice to play with an even sum, leading to her loss.

Given this understanding, the program checks the parity of the sum of coins (a + b):
- If the sum is even, Bob wins.
- If the sum is odd, Alice wins.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of (a + b) and printing the appropriate winner for each test case.

### Correctness:

The provided program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins in both wallets. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
