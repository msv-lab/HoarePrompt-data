The code snippet `b = int(list(s.split())[1])` reassigns the value of `b` to be the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting the string `s` by whitespace. The values of `t`, `s`, `a`, the sum of `a` and `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is the new string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting the new `s` by whitespace; `b` is the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting the new `s` by whitespace; The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even; `i` is 5.**
