The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases, and it is specified that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The values of `a` and `b` for each test case are not affected by this code snippet and remain as integers between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ \(10^9\).**
