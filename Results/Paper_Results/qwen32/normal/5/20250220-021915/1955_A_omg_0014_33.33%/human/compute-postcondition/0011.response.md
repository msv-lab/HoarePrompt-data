The code snippet provided updates the value of `d` to be `c / 2`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input; `d` is `c / 2`. If `a * b < a * d`, the condition is satisfied as is. Otherwise, `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d`.**
