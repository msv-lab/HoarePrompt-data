The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input.**
