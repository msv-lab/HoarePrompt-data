The code snippet assigns the value of `c / 2` to the variable `d`. Therefore, `d` will now hold the value of `c` divided by 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input; `d` is `c / 2`.**
