Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input; `d` is `c / 2`. The condition `a * b < a * d` is checked, and regardless of whether it is true or false, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.**
