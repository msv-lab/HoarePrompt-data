Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given problem description. Let's analyze why it is incorrect:

1. The input parsing is incorrect. The problem states that the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, and each subsequent line contains three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, the code reads the first integer as `n` (number of test cases) and then tries to parse the next three integers as `a`, `b`, and `c`. This will lead to errors because `c` is not defined in the problem description and `b` is incorrectly used in the calculations.

2. The logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed. The code attempts to calculate the cost by comparing `a * b` and `a * d`, where `d` is `c / 2`. However, this does not correctly account for the promotion price `b` for two yogurts.

3. The program does not handle the case where buying yogurts in pairs is more cost-effective than buying them individually. For example, if `n` is odd, the program should buy `(n // 2)` pairs and one individual yogurt, or `(n // 2)` pairs if `n` is even.

Let's consider a test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5 9
```

**Expected Output:**
```
14
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
15
```

The program incorrectly calculates the cost as `15` instead of `14` because it does not correctly handle the promotion price for buying two yogurts.

To fix the program, it should correctly read the inputs and calculate the minimum cost based on the promotion price for two yogurts. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of pairs and the remaining yogurt
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        # Calculate the minimum cost
        cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        print(cost)

func()
```

This corrected version reads the inputs correctly and calculates the minimum cost by considering the promotion price for two yogurts and the cost for any remaining yogurt.
