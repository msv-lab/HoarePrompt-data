Reasoning:  
The provided code contains a logical error in the way it calculates the minimum cost for buying the yogurts. The code incorrectly calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is not relevant to the problem. Instead, it should determine the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price and calculate the cost accordingly.

Here's a breakdown of the correct approach:
1. Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price, which is `n // 2`.
2. Calculate the cost of these pairs, which is `(n // 2) * b`.
3. Determine if there is an odd yogurt left over after buying the pairs, which is `n % 2`.
4. If there is an odd yogurt left over, add the cost of one yogurt (`a`) to the total cost.
5. Compare this total cost with the cost of buying all yogurts individually (`n * a`) and print the minimum of the two.

The provided code does not follow this logic. Instead, it incorrectly compares `a * b` (which does not make sense in this context) with `round(a * d)` and prints the result, which leads to incorrect outputs.

Correctness: **False**
