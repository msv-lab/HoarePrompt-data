In the given task, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the state of the objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n):`, which means the only variable we can adjust is `n` to determine if the loop will execute.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
2. **Given State**: Before the loop starts, `n` is provided as an input integer, and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. However, `t` is not directly related to the execution of the loop, it seems to indicate the number of test cases or iterations of some outer process that provides `n`.
3. **Adjustments Needed**: To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0**

This state ensures that the `for` loop will execute at least once.
