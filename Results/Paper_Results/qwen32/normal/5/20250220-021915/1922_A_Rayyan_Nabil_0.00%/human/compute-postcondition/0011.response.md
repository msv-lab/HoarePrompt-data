The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration of the loop. Given that `i` is the current index, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Here are the details:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`).
- Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `l`) are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is an input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is an input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `l` remains unchanged**.

Since `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it to say `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is an input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is an input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is `i + 1`, `l` remains unchanged**.
