The code snippet provided does not change any of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. It only assigns the string `'YES'` to the variable `l`, which already holds the value `'YES'`. Therefore, the value of `l` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is an input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is an input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `l` is 'YES'. At the current index `i`, `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`.**
