To determine the output state after all executions of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations. 

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, the loop reads the integer `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. It then checks each index `i` from 0 to `n-1` to see if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such an index `i` is found, the variable `l` is set to 'YES'. If no such index is found, `l` is set to 'NO'. After this check, `l` is printed.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be the result of the last iteration of the loop. The state of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` changes with each iteration, but the final output state will be determined by the last set of inputs.

Since the loop prints the value of `l` for each iteration, the output state after all the executions of the loop is simply the output of the last iteration.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **the value of `l` after the last iteration**.

In natural language, this means that the output state after all executions of the loop is the result of the last test case: 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` in the last test case such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, otherwise 'NO'.
