Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**

The value of `t` has been updated to the integer value obtained from the input. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain as described in the initial state since they are not affected by the provided code snippet.
