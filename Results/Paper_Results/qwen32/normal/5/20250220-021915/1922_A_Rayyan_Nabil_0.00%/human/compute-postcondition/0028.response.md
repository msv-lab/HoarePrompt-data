The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to prepare for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain greater than the new value of `i`.

The value of `l` is determined by the condition inside the loop and does not affect the loop's continuation. Therefore, `l` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
