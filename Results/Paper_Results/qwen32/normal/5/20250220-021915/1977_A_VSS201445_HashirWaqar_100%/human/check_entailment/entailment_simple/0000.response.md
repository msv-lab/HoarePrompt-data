### Reasoning:
The problem statement describes a scenario where Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move. Given `n` moves, we need to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

The key observation is that:
- If `m` is greater than `n`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves because the maximum number of cubes we can have is `n` (if we add one cube in each move).
- If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, we can reach `m` cubes if the difference `n - m` is even. This is because we can balance the number of additions and subtractions to end up with `m` cubes. Specifically, if `n - m` is even, we can perform `(n - m) / 2` removals and the rest (`n - (n - m) / 2`) additions.

The provided code correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.
- If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly determines whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the described logic. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
