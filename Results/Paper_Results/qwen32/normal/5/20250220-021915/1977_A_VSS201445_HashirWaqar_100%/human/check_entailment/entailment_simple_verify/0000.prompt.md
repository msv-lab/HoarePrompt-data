You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the integer provided initially. For each of the `t` iterations, the program has read two integers `n` and `m`, and printed "YES" if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even; otherwise, it printed "NO". The values of `n` and `m` are determined by the input provided for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube from the tower in one move. We need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, starting from 0 cubes.

### Key Points:
1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Operations**: Each move can either add or remove 1 cube.
3. **Goal**: After `n` moves, the tower should have exactly `m` cubes.
4. **Constraints**: `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`.

### Conditions for a Valid Solution:
- **Parity Check**: Since each move changes the number of cubes by exactly 1, the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes (`n - m`) must be even. This is because an even number of moves (additions and/or subtractions) is required to reach an even difference.
- **Non-Negative Cubes**: The number of cubes `m` must be non-negative, which is inherently satisfied since `m` is at least 1.
- **Feasibility**: The number of cubes `m` must be reachable within `n` moves, which means `m` should not exceed `n` (since we can't remove more cubes than we have).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check:
- **Condition 1**: `n >= m` ensures that we do not attempt to remove more cubes than we have.
- **Condition 2**: `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the number of moves required to reach `m` cubes is feasible given the constraints.

### Example Test Cases:
1. **Input**: `3 3`
   - `n = 3`, `m = 3`
   - `n >= m` is True
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is True
   - **Output**: "YES" (Correct)
   
2. **Input**: `2 4`
   - `n = 2`, `m = 4`
   - `n >= m` is False
   - **Output**: "NO" (Correct)
   
3. **Input**: `5 3`
   - `n = 5`, `m = 3`
   - `n >= m` is True
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is True
   - **Output**: "YES" (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly checks the necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, which are the necessary conditions for the problem. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the output is correct for all valid inputs.
