### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
- **Operations**: Each move can either add or remove 1 cube.
- **Goal**: After `n` moves, the tower should have exactly `m` cubes.
- **Constraints**: `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`.

#### Key Conditions for a Valid Solution:
1. **Parity Check**: The difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes (`n - m`) must be even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by exactly 1, and an even number of such changes is required to reach an even difference.
2. **Feasibility**: The number of cubes `m` must be reachable within `n` moves, which means `m` should not exceed `n` (since we can't remove more cubes than we have).

#### Program Analysis:
The program checks two conditions:
- `n >= m`: This ensures that we do not attempt to remove more cubes than we have.
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This ensures that the number of moves required to reach `m` cubes is feasible given the constraints.

Let's validate these conditions with the annotated code and example test cases.

#### Annotated Code Review:
```python
#State of the program right before the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the integer provided initially. For each of the `t` iterations, the program has read two integers `n` and `m`, and printed "YES" if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even; otherwise, it printed "NO". The values of `n` and `m` are determined by the input provided for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it prints "YES" if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even; otherwise, it prints "NO".
```

#### Example Test Cases:
1. **Input**: `3 3`
   - `n = 3`, `m = 3`
   - `n >= m` is True
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is True
   - **Output**: "YES" (Correct)
   
2. **Input**: `2 4`
   - `n = 2`, `m = 4`
   - `n >= m` is False
   - **Output**: "NO" (Correct)
   
3. **Input**: `5 3`
   - `n = 5`, `m = 3`
   - `n >= m` is True
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is True
   - **Output**: "YES" (Correct)

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly checks the necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

**Final: True**
