Given the initial state, we have the following conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, then the conditions specified in the if part hold.
- Otherwise, either `n` is less than `m`, or the difference between `n` and `m` is not even, as specified in the else part.

However, the provided Python code snippet is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `m` or any conditions related to them. It will always print the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
