The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not hold any state that needs to be adjusted. The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`, which is not part of the loop head but rather the loop control expression. 

Given the information, the state at the start of the next iteration does not change in terms of the loop head variables. However, the loop will execute one more time if there are more iterations left based on the input.

Since the loop head does not have any variables to adjust, the state remains the same except for the implicit decrement in the number of iterations left, which is controlled by the input and not directly reflected in the provided state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, either `n` is less than `m`, or the difference between `n` and `m` is not even, as specified in the else part.**
