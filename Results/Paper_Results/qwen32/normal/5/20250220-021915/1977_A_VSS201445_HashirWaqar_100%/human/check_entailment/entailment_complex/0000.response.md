### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to end up with a tower of `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding or removing exactly one cube from the tower. 

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program:

1. **Initial Conditions**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Moves Allowed**: Each move can either add a cube (+1) or remove a cube (-1).
3. **Objective**: After `n` moves, the tower should have exactly `m` cubes.

To achieve this:
- The net effect of the moves should be to have `m` cubes. If `m` is positive, we need more additions than subtractions.
- The difference between the number of additions and subtractions must be `m`.
- Since each move changes the number of cubes by Â±1, the total number of moves `n` must be sufficient to achieve this difference.
- The difference `n - m` must be even because each pair of an addition and a subtraction cancels out to a net change of 0, and any remaining moves must either all be additions (if `m > 0`) or all be subtractions (if `m < 0`), which means the total number of moves must be able to be split into pairs plus possibly one more addition or subtraction.

The provided program checks these conditions:
- It verifies that `n` is at least `m` (since we can't have more cubes than moves).
- It checks that the difference `n - m` is even (since the net effect of the moves must be an even number of moves to achieve the exact number of cubes).

If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Conclusion:

The logic in the program correctly determines whether it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the conditions outlined. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
