Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the integer provided initially. For each of the `t` iterations, the program has read two integers `n` and `m`, and printed "YES" if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even; otherwise, it printed "NO". The values of `n` and `m` are determined by the input provided for each iteration.**

In simpler terms: The loop has finished executing for all `t` test cases. For each test case, it checked if `n` is at least `m` and if their difference is even, printing "YES" if true, otherwise "NO".
