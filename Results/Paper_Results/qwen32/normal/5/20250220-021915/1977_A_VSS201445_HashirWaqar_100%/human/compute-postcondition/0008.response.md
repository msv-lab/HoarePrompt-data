The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies the conditions based on the values of `n` and `m`, but these conditions are not directly affected by the input operation itself. The input operation simply updates the values of `n` and `m` to the values provided by the user.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, then the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, either `n` is less than `m`, or the difference between `n` and `m` is not even, as specified in the else part.**

In simpler terms, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the input. The conditions based on `n` and `m` are still valid but need to be re-evaluated with the new values of `n` and `m`.
