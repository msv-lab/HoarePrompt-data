### Reasoning:

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. We need to determine if, after `n` moves, it's possible for the tower to have exactly `m` cubes.

Here's the key insight:
- If `m` cubes are to be the final count, and `n` is the total number of moves, the difference `(n - m)` must be even. This is because each addition or removal of a cube is a single move, and to end up with a specific number of cubes, the number of additions must balance the number of removals (or vice versa) in such a way that the net effect is the desired number of cubes.
- Additionally, `n` must be at least `m` because if `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves since each move can only add or remove one cube.

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
- It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
- It checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even by using the modulus operation `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.

If both conditions are met, it prints "YES", indicating that it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the provided logic and handles all the test cases as described in the problem statement.
