The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, but `t` is not used in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the value of `t` remains unchanged. The variables `n` and `m` are newly assigned values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input.**
