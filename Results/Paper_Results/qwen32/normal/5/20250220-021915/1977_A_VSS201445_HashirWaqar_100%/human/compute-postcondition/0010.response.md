The code snippet provided is a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. According to the initial state description, the value to be printed does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `m`. The `print` statement is unconditional and will always output `'NO'`, regardless of the conditions involving `n` and `m`.

Let's break it down:
- The initial state describes conditions related to `n` and `m`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is straightforward and outputs `'NO'` without any conditional logic.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
