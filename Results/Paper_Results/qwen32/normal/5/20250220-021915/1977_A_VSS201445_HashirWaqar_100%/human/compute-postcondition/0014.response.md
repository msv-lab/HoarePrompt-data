The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The precondition describes a set of conditions related to the integers `n` and `m` but does not affect the content of the `print` statement itself. Regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`, the `print` statement will always output `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided and does not depend on any variables or conditions.
3. The initial state describes conditions related to `n` and `m`, but these conditions do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
