The code snippet sorts the dictionary `d` based on the values of its items. The sorting is done primarily by the value of the cumulative counts (i.e., the second element of each key-value pair, `x[1]`), in ascending order. If there are ties (i.e., two items have the same cumulative count), it then sorts by the keys (i.e., `x[0]`), in descending order.

This means `d` will no longer be a dictionary but a list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair from the original dictionary. The list is sorted according to the specified criteria.

Output State: **`d` is a list of tuples sorted by the cumulative count of opening parentheses minus closing parentheses (in ascending order), and by the keys (in descending order) in case of ties.**
