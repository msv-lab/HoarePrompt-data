The code snippet `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1` increments the value at index `i + 1` in the dictionary `d` by adding 1 to the value at index `i`. 

Given the initial state, `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has already been incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed). Therefore, the code is effectively setting `d[i]` to `d[i-1] + 1`.

The values of `s`, `n`, and the initial value of `i` remain unchanged. The only change is the value in the dictionary `d` at index `i`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `d[i]` is `d[i-1] + 1`**.
