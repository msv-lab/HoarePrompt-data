### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to perform the "balanced shuffle" operation on a balanced parentheses sequence as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the steps and verify if the program meets the requirements:

1. **Initialization and Balance Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty dictionary `d` and sets `d[0] = 0`.
   - It then iterates over the input string `s` (a balanced parentheses sequence) and calculates the cumulative balance of parentheses up to each position. This balance is stored in the dictionary `d` where the keys are positions (starting from 1) and the values are the corresponding balance.
   - If the character is '(', it increments the balance by 1. If the character is ')', it decrements the balance by 1.
   - After the loop, the balance at the last position `n` is removed from the dictionary, as it is guaranteed to be zero (since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence).

2. **Sorting**:
   - The dictionary `d` is converted to a list of tuples and sorted. The sorting is done first by the balance value in ascending order and then by the position in descending order (to break ties).
   - This sorting ensures that the characters are ordered first by their prefix balance and then by their position in reverse order when balances are the same.

3. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The function then constructs the result string `ans` by concatenating characters from the original string `s` in the order specified by the sorted list of tuples.
   - The final result `ans` is returned.

### Verification:
- The program correctly calculates the balance of prefixes and sorts them as required.
- The sorting criteria ensure that the resulting sequence maintains the balance property and is a valid shuffle.
- The program handles the constraints (length of `s` up to 500,000) efficiently, as the operations (dictionary updates, sorting) are linear with respect to the length of the string.

### Conclusion:
The program implements the balanced shuffle operation correctly and efficiently according to the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
