Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is not yet initialized, and the character at position `i` in `s` is ")"; `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] - 1`.**

In natural language: The string `s` remains unchanged as a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence. The length `n` of the string `s` is unchanged. The variable `i` remains uninitialized. The character at position `i` in `s` is still ")". The value of `d[i + 1]` is now `d[i] - 1`.
