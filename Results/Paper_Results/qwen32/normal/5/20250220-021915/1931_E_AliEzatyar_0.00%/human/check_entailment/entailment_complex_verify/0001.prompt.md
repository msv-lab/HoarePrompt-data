You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of test cases, where each test case is represented as a list containing two integers n and m, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The integers n and m satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6, and each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: counter is the number of trailing '0's in the last test case of num.
    return counter
    #The program returns the number of trailing '0's in the last test case of num.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of a list containing two integers `n` and `m`, followed by a list of `n` integers. The function returns the number of trailing '0's in the last element of the last test case in the list, assuming that element is a string representation of a number.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Mechanics**:
    - **Anna's Turn**: She reverses the digits of a chosen number.
    - **Sasha's Turn**: He concatenates two numbers and replaces them with the concatenated number.
    - The game ends when there is only one number left.
    - **Winning Condition**: Sasha wins if the final number is at least \(10^m\).

2. **Key Observations**:
    - **Anna's Optimal Strategy**: Anna will choose to reverse numbers to minimize the final number, potentially reducing the number of digits.
    - **Sasha's Optimal Strategy**: Sasha will concatenate numbers to maximize the final number, especially if he can avoid concatenating numbers that would reduce the digit count significantly.
    - **Leading Zeros**: Reversing a number can introduce leading zeros, which are removed. This affects the number of digits.
    - **Game Progression**: The number of elements decreases by 1 with each of Sasha's turns, so there will be \(n-1\) turns for Sasha.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
    - For each test case, it reads the number of integers \(n\) and the threshold \(m\), followed by the list of integers.

2. **Main Logic**:
    - **Total Digits Calculation**: The program calculates the total number of digits in the list.
    - **Leading Zeros Calculation**: It uses `func_1` to count trailing zeros in each number (which become leading zeros after reversal). These are stored in the `zeros` list.
    - **Sorting and Pairing**: The `zeros` list is sorted in descending order, and every second element is summed up to `subtract_zero`. This suggests that Sasha might be able to avoid adding these zeros back into the final number.
    - **Winning Condition Check**: The program checks if the difference between the total number of digits and `subtract_zero` is at least \(m+1\). If true, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
    - This function counts the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of a number.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Output String**: The program outputs `'Sashah'` instead of `'Sasha'` when Sasha wins.
2. **Logic for Winning Condition**: The logic for determining the winner seems flawed. The program does not correctly simulate the game dynamics, particularly how Sasha and Anna's moves affect the final number of digits.
3. **Handling Leading Zeros**: The program does not fully account for how leading zeros affect the final number after concatenation.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the game logic and has an incorrect output string. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program does not correctly simulate the game dynamics and has an incorrect output string.
Correctness: **False**
