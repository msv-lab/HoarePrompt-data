#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of test cases, where each test case is represented as a list containing two integers n and m, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The integers n and m satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6, and each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: counter is the number of trailing '0's in the last test case of num.
    return counter
    #The program returns the number of trailing '0's in the last test case of num.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of a list containing two integers `n` and `m`, followed by a list of `n` integers. The function returns the number of trailing '0's in the last element of the last test case in the list, assuming that element is a string representation of a number.
