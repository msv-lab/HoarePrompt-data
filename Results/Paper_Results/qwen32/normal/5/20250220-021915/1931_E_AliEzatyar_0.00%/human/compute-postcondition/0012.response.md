The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not specify the value of `counter`, so we can only say that it has been increased by 1. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `i` is `i`, `counter` is increased by 1**.
