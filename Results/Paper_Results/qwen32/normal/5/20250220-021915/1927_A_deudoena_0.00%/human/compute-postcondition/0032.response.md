To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and how it affects the variables involved in the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of the character 'B' in the string `inpstr`. If 'B' is not found, `ind1` would be the result of `inpstr.find('B')`, which is `-1`.
- `ind2` is the index of the first occurrence of the character 'B' from the end of the string `inpstr`. If 'B' is not found, `ind2` is set to `0`. This can be achieved using `len(inpstr) - inpstr[::-1].find('B') - 1` if 'B' is found, otherwise `0`.
- `outind` is set to `0` (though it is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is the length of the string `s` (though it is not used in the print statement).
- `s` is the original string (though it is not used in the print statement).
- `t` is the length of the string `inpstr`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `ind1`:**
   - `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`. If no 'B' is found, `ind1` is `-1`.

2. **Determine `ind2`:**
   - `ind2` is the index of the first 'B' from the end of `inpstr`. If no 'B' is found, `ind2` is `0`.

3. **Calculate the Expression:**
   - The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` calculates the difference between the length of the string and the sum of `ind1` and `ind2`.

### Scenarios:
- **If `inpstr` contains no 'B':**
  - `ind1` will be `-1`.
  - `ind2` will be `0`.
  - The expression evaluates to `len(inpstr) - 0 - (-1) = len(inpstr) + 1`.

- **If `inpstr` contains at least one 'B':**
  - Let's assume the first 'B' is at index `x` from the start and at index `y` from the end.
  - `ind1` will be `x`.
  - `ind2` will be `len(inpstr) - y - 1`.
  - The expression evaluates to `len(inpstr) - (len(inpstr) - y - 1) - x = y - x + 1`.

### Final Output:
The output depends on whether 'B' is present in `inpstr` and its positions.

- If `inpstr` contains no 'B', the output will be `len(inpstr) + 1`.
- If `inpstr` contains at least one 'B', the output will be the number of characters between the first 'B' from the start and the first 'B' from the end, inclusive.

Output: **len(inpstr) + 1 if no 'B' is found in inpstr, otherwise the number of characters between the first 'B' from the start and the first 'B' from the end, inclusive (where ind1 is the index of the first 'B' from the start and ind2 is the index of the first 'B' from the end)**
