The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is placed within, but it does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, none of the variables `ind1`, `ind2`, `outind`, `n`, `s`, `t`, `inpstr`, or `i` will be modified.

Output State: **`ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is 1, `outind` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is the original string, `t` is the length of `inpstr`, `inpstr` must have at least 1 character, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
