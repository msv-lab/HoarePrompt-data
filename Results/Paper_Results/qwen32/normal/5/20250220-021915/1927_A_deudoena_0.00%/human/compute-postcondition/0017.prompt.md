Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string; `inpstr` is the input string; `ind1` is 0; `ind2` is 0; `outind` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i, j in enumerate(inpstr):
    if j == 'B':
        ind1 = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is a character. If `j` is 'B', then `ind1` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` is not 'B' and `ind1` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is the character at the new index `i` in `inpstr`. If `j` is 'B', `ind1` is set to the incremented value of `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to `ind1` and the loop or if statement continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is the character at index `k + 1` in `inpstr`, and `j` is not 'B'. Since the if condition `j == 'B'` is not met, the code does not execute the if block and there is no else block to execute, so the state remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
