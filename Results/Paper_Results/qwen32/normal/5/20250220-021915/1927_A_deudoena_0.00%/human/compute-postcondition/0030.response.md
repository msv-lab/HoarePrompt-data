Postcondition: **`ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is 2 if the second-to-last character in `inpstr` is 'B', otherwise `ind2` remains 0, `outind` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is the original string, `t` is the length of `inpstr`, `inpstr` must have at least 1 character, and `i` is 2. If the second-to-last character in `inpstr` is 'B', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
