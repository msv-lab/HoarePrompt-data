The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement that it is contained within. The values of the variables `i`, `j`, and `ind1` do not change as a result of the `break` statement.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `j` is the character at the new index `i` in `inpstr`, `ind1` is equal to the incremented value of `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
