Postcondition: **`ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is 1 if the last character before the `i`-th character from the end of `inpstr` is 'B', otherwise `ind2` remains 0, `outind` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is the original string, `t` is the length of `inpstr`, `inpstr` must have at least 1 character, `i` is 1. If the last character before the `i`-th character from the end of `inpstr` is 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
