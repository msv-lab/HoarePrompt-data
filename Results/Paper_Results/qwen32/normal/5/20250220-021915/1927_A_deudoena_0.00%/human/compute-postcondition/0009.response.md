The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `j`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `inpstr`. If there are more characters in `inpstr` after the current index `i`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is a character. If `j` was 'B', the loop would have broken, and we wouldn't be considering the next iteration. Since we are considering the next iteration, `j` must not have been 'B'. Therefore, `ind1` remains unchanged, and we need to move to the next character in the string.

The index `i` should be incremented by 1 to point to the next character in `inpstr`. The character `j` will take the value of the character at the new index `i`.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `j` is the character at the new index `i` in `inpstr`**
