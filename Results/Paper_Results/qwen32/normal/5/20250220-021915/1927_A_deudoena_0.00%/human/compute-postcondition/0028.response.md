The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `ind2`. Given that `i` is 2, `ind2` is now assigned the value 2. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is 2, `outind` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is the original string, `t` is the length of `inpstr`, `inpstr` must have at least 1 character, `i` is 2**.
