Functionality: **The function reads a string `inpstr` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B'. It calculates and prints the number of characters between the first 'B' from the start and the first 'B' from the end of the string, inclusive. If no 'B' is found (which is not possible as per the problem statement), it would print `len(inpstr) + 1`.**
