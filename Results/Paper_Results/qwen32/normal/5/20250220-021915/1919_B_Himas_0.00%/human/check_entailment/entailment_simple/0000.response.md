Reasoning:  
The given program is incorrect for the problem described. The program reads the input and calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` for each test case. It then prints this difference, which does not correspond to the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.

The correct approach to solve the problem involves calculating the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the total penalty. The key is to find segments where the sum is zero, as these segments will have a penalty of zero. If the entire array cannot be split into such segments, we need to find a way to minimize the penalties of the remaining segments.

The provided program does not implement any logic to find such optimal splits and instead just computes the difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which is not related to the penalty calculation.

Correctness: **False**
