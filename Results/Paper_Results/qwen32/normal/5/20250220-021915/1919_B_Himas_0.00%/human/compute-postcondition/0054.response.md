Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `s` is the new input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in the string `e`, `P` is increased by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `P` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `e`, and `q`) retain their initial values.
