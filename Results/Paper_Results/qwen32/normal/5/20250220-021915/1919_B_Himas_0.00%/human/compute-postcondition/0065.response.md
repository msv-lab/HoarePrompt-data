Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only '+' and '-' characters. For each test case, it calculates the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and prints this difference.**
