To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the entire string `e` and how the loop processes each character in it.

The loop iterates over each character `q` in the string `e`. For each character:
- If `q` is '+', it increments `P` by 1.
- Otherwise, it increments `M` by 1.

The loop will execute for each character in the string `e`. Therefore, after all iterations, `P` will be the count of '+' characters in the string `e`, and `M` will be the count of all other characters in the string `e`.

The variables `t`, `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged throughout the loop, as they are not modified in the loop body.

### Output State:
- `t`: Remains the same as the initial state.
- `n`: Remains the same as the initial state.
- `s`: Remains the same as the initial state.
- `e`: Remains the same as the initial state.
- `P`: The count of '+' characters in the string `e`.
- `M`: The count of all other characters in the string `e`.
- `i`: `i + 2` (This increment only happens once, not per iteration of the loop, so it's `i + 2` from the initial state).

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `s` is the new input integer, `e` is the new input string, `P` is the count of '+' characters in `e`, `M` is the count of all other characters in `e`, `i` is `i + 2`.**

In simpler terms, the final state is the same as the initial state for `t`, `n`, `s`, and `e`, except that `P` and `M` are updated to reflect the counts of '+' and other characters in `e`, respectively, and `i` is incremented by 2.
