To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so it can be ignored for this task.
2. **n**: An integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\). This variable is also not used in the provided code snippet, so it can be ignored for this task.
3. **s**: An input integer. This variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so it can be ignored for this task.
4. **e**: An input string. This variable is used in the code snippet to calculate \(P\) and \(M\).
5. **P**: The number of '+' characters in the string \(e\).
6. **M**: The number of non-'+' characters in the string \(e\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(P - M)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate \(P\)**: \(P\) is the count of '+' characters in the string \(e\).
2. **Calculate \(M\)**: \(M\) is the count of characters in the string \(e\) that are not '+'. This can be calculated as the total length of the string \(e\) minus the count of '+' characters (\(P\)).
3. **Compute \(P - M\)**: The expression \(P - M\) will yield an integer value. This value will be the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of non-'+' characters in the string \(e\).

### Description of Output:
The output of the `print` statement will be the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of non-'+' characters in the string \(e\).

### Final Output:
Output: **P - M (where P is the number of '+' characters in the string e and M is the number of non-'+' characters in the string e)**
