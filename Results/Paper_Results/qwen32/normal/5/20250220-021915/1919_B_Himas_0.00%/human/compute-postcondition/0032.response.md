The only object in the loop head is the variable `q`, which iterates over the string `e`. According to the code, the loop will execute once for each character in the string `e`. At the end of the previous iteration, `q` has taken on the value of the current character in the string `e`.

To execute one more time, `q` must take on the value of the next character in the string `e`. The variables `t`, `n`, `s`, `i`, `P`, and `M` are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted.

Given that `q` is the only variable we can adjust and it iterates over each character in the string `e`, the next state should reflect `q` being the next character in `e`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `s` is the input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `i` is `i + 1`. If `q` equals '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1. `q` is the next character in `e`**.
