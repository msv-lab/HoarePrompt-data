Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an input integer, `e` is an input string, `P` is 0.**

In this output state, the variables `t`, `n`, `s`, and `e` retain their initial values, and a new variable `P` is introduced with the value 0.
