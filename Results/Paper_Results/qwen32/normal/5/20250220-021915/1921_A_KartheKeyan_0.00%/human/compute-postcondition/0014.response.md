The loop provided runs exactly 4 times, as it is defined by `for i in range(4)`. This means it will read and process 4 pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the final state after the 4th iteration. 

- After the 1st iteration, `coord` contains one pair of coordinates.
- After the 2nd iteration, `coord` contains two pairs of coordinates.
- After the 3rd iteration, `coord` contains three pairs of coordinates.

Therefore, after the 4th and final iteration, `coord` will contain four pairs of coordinates. The variables `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

Output State: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), n is a non-zero integer, coord is [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)], res is 0, i is 3.**

In natural language: After all iterations are complete, `t` remains the same integer representing the number of test cases, `n` remains the same non-zero integer, `res` remains 0, and `coord` contains a list of four tuples, each representing a pair of coordinates read from the input. The loop variable `i` will be 3 at the end of the last iteration, but it is important to note that `i` is a loop control variable and its value is not typically used after the loop ends.
