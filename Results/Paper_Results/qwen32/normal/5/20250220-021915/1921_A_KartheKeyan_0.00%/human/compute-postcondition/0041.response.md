Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]))`, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

Explanation: The `coord` list is emptied by the code, but the other variables remain unchanged. Note that the expressions for `res`, `p1`, and `p2` are now based on an empty list, which would typically cause an error if accessed directly, but the state is described as it is.
