The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and whether it is less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero value, `coord` is a list with at least 6 elements (the original 5 elements plus the new tuple `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are the input integers), `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer.**
