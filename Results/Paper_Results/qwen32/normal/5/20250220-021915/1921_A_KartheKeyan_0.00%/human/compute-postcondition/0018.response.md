Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero integer, `coord` is the sorted list of tuples [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)], `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
