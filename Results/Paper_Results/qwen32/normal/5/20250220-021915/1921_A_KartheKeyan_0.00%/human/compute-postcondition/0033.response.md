Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is 1, `coord` is `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

### Explanation:
The loop runs for 4 iterations, as indicated by `for i in range(4)`. After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `coord` will contain 4 tuples, each representing the coordinates `(x, y)` obtained from the input. The variable `i` will have the value 3, which is the last value it takes in the loop (since the loop iterates over the range 0 to 3). The variables `p1` and `p2` are defined after the loop completes because they depend on having at least 2 and 4 elements in `coord`, respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
