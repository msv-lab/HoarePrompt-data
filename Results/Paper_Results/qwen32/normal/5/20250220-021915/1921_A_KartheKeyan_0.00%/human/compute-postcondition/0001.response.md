Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are four lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of an integer input. The values of `t`, `x_i`, `y_i`, and the structure of the input remain unchanged.
