The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `coord`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero value, `coord` is a list with at least 4 elements, `res` is 0, `i` is 3 (or any value, as it will be set to 0 by the loop), `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**
