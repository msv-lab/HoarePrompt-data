Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero integer, `coord` is `[(x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input, `i` is 4**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `coord`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The `coord` list now includes a tuple `(x, y)` as its first element, where `x` and `y` are the newly read integers.
