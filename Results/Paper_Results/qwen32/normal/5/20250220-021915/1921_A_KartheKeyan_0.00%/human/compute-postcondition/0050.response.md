Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero value, `coord` is a list with at least 6 elements (the original 5 elements plus the new tuple `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are the input integers), `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer.`**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `coord` now includes the new tuple `(x, y)` as its sixth element.
