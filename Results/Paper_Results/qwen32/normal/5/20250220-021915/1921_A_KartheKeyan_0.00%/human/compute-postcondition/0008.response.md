The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range `4`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 (since the loop runs from 0 to 3). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4. However, since the range is 4, when `i` is 4, the loop will not execute again.

Given that the loop will not execute again when `i` is 4, we do not need to modify any other variables in the loop head, and the loop will terminate after `i` reaches 4.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero integer, `coord` is `[(x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input, `i` is 4**
