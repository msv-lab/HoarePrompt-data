Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been changed to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values or expressions.
