You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program: 
a = []
n = int(input())
sa = input()
na = sa.split()
for ai in na:
    a.append(ai)
func_1(len(a))

def func_1(c):
    m = 0
    if c == 2:
        print(f'4 1')
        print(f'1 2')
    else:
        print(f'13 0')
    return



- Annotated Code: 
a = []
n = int(input())
sa = input()
na = sa.split()
for ai in na:
    a.append(ai)
func_1(len(a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a list of integers where 1 <= len(c) <= 18 and 0 <= c[i] <= 10^7 for all i in the range of the length of c.
def func_1(c):
    m = 0
    if (c == 2) :
        print(f'4 1')
        #This is printed: 4 1
        print(f'1 2')
        #This is printed: 1 2
    else :
        print(f'13 0')
        #This is printed: 13 0
    #State: `c` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(c) <= 18 and 0 <= c[i] <= 10^7 for all i in the range of the length of c; `m` is 0. If `c` contains exactly one element and that element is 2, then `c` is a list containing a single element, 2. Otherwise, `c` is not equal to 2.
    return
    #The program returns nothing (None)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Input Parsing:** The program reads the input but does not convert the list of strings (`na`) to integers. This will cause issues when trying to perform arithmetic operations on the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Logic for Computing MEX:** The program does not actually compute the MEX or perform the operations described in the problem. Instead, it has hardcoded outputs based on the length of the array, which is incorrect and does not follow the problem's requirements.

3. **Handling Different Cases:** The program only handles two specific cases (when the length of the array is 2 and when it is not 2). It does not provide a general solution for arrays of length 1 to 18.

4. **Output:** The program does not compute the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the operations. It just prints hardcoded values, which are not necessarily correct for all inputs.

Given these issues, it's clear that the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It fails to consider the actual values in the array and the operations needed to maximize the sum.

Correctness: **False**
