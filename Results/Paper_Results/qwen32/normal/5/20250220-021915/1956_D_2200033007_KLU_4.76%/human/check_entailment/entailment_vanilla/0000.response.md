Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Input Parsing:** The program reads the input but does not convert the list of strings (`na`) to integers. This will cause issues when trying to perform arithmetic operations on the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Logic for Computing MEX:** The program does not actually compute the MEX or perform the operations described in the problem. Instead, it has hardcoded outputs based on the length of the array, which is incorrect and does not follow the problem's requirements.

3. **Handling Different Cases:** The program only handles two specific cases (when the length of the array is 2 and when it is not 2). It does not provide a general solution for arrays of length 1 to 18.

4. **Output:** The program does not compute the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the operations. It just prints hardcoded values, which are not necessarily correct for all inputs.

Given these issues, it's clear that the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It fails to consider the actual values in the array and the operations needed to maximize the sum.

Correctness: **False**
