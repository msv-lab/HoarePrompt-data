### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate and correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Data Type Issue**:
   - The program reads the input array `a` as strings and does not convert them to integers. This will cause issues when performing arithmetic operations, as the program is expected to compute the MEX value and manipulate the array elements numerically.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` does not implement the logic to compute the MEX value for any subarray or perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array.
   - The function only handles two specific cases:
     - If the length of the array is 2, it outputs `4 1` and the operation `1 2`. This is correct only for the specific case where the initial array is `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`, but it does not generalize to other arrays of length 2.
     - For all other lengths, it outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect for most cases. For example, for the input `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the correct output should involve operations to maximize the sum, not just outputting `13 0`.

3. **Generalization Issues**:
   - The function does not generalize to handle all possible lengths of the array and all possible initial values within the array. It lacks the logic to compute the MEX for any subarray and to perform operations that maximize the sum.

4. **Test Case Verification**:
   - The original assessment provides a specific test case (`4 1 2 3 4`) to illustrate the incorrectness of the program. The program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect. The correct approach would involve setting subarrays to their respective MEX values to maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing the allowed operations. It fails to handle various input cases correctly and lacks the necessary logic to compute the MEX value and perform operations on the array.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
