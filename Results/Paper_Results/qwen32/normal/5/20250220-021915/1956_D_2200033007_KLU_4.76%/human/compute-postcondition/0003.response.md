The given print statement is `print(f'1 2')`. This is a formatted string literal (f-string) in Python, but it does not include any variables from the initial state. It simply prints the string "1 2" as it is written.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state describes `c` as a list containing a single element, 2, and `m` as 0.
- However, these variables are not used in the print statement.
- The print statement directly outputs the string "1 2".

Output: **1 2**
