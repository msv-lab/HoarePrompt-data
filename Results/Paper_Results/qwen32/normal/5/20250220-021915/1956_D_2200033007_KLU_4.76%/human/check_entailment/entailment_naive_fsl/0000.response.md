Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing the allowed operations. The function `func_1` only handles two specific cases (when the length of the array is 2 and when it is not 2), and it does not generalize to all possible inputs. 

Here are some issues with the code:
1. The array `a` is being populated with string values instead of integers, which will cause issues when performing arithmetic operations.
2. The function `func_1` does not compute the MEX value for any subarray and does not perform any operations to maximize the sum.
3. The function does not handle all possible lengths of the array correctly. For example, it incorrectly outputs `13 0` for all arrays with a length other than 2, which is not always the correct maximum sum.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
Input:
```
4
1 2 3 4
```
The program will output:
```
13 0
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
12 2
1 4
1 4
```
Explanation: The MEX of the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is `0`, so setting the entire array to `0` would not maximize the sum. Instead, the MEX of the array is `0`, and the optimal strategy involves setting the array to a higher MEX value that maximizes the sum, which can be achieved by setting subarrays to their respective MEX values.

Thus, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all possible cases.
