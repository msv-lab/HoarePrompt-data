Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. It only handles specific cases (when the length of the array is 2, it outputs a fixed result, and for all other cases, it outputs another fixed result). The program does not implement the logic required to compute the MEX and perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.

Here's a brief explanation of what the program should do:

1. Compute the MEX of the current subarray.
2. Replace the subarray with the MEX value.
3. Repeat the process until no more beneficial operations can be performed.

The current implementation does not follow these steps and does not consider the actual values in the array or the operations needed to maximize the sum. Therefore, it is incorrect for the general problem as described.
