To determine what will be printed by the `print(right)` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and identify the value of the `right` variable.

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is 2.
- `right` is not equal to 2.
- The current value of `right` is not equal to `n`.

However, the initial state does not provide an explicit value for `right`. It only states that `right` is not equal to 2, but it does not specify what `right` actually is. Since no other information is given about the value of `right`, the most precise description we can provide is that `right` is some value that is not equal to 2.

Given the constraints, the most precise description of what will be printed is that `right` is a value not equal to 2. Since we don't have more specific information, we can't determine an exact numerical value for `right`.

Output: **right (where right is a value not equal to 2)**
