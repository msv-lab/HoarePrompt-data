The code snippet `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `trightZero` by 1. The initial state specifies that `mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `rightZero` is incremented by 1. However, the code snippet only affects `trightZero`. Therefore, `trightZero` is increased by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged in terms of their conditions or relationships.

Output State: **`mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `i + 1`, `rightZero` is incremented by 1, `trightZero` is incremented by 1.**
