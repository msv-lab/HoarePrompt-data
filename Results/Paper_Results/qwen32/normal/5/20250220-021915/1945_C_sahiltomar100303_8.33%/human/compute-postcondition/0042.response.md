The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `mid`, `n` is greater than `0`, and `mid` is `n // 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be less than `n`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`. If the current character `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 2 and `trightZero` is 2. If the current character `s[i]` is '1', then `rightOne` is 1 and `trightOne` is 1, `i` is `mid + 1`**
