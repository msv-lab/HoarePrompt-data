The code `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `trightOne` by 1. The other variables `mid`, `i`, and `rightOne` are not directly affected by this statement, so their values remain as per the initial state.

Given:
- `mid` must be less than `n`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`

After executing the code, the value of `trightOne` increases by 1.

Output State: **`mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `i + 1`, `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`, `trightOne` is `trightOne + 1`**
