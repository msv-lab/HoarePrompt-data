To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables `i`, `mid`, and `n` as these are the only ones mentioned in the loop head. 

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `mid` must be less than `n`.
- The loop iterates over `i` starting from `mid` up to, but not including, `n`.

The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`.

Since `mid` and `n` do not change within the loop, they remain the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `i_end + 1`**

However, since we don't have the specific value of `i_end`, we can generalize it as:
State: **`mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**

Given the provided information, the final state can be written as:
State: **`mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is incremented by 1**

Since we do not have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can't provide a specific number, but we know it is incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `i + 1`**

However, to match the format of the previous examples, we can assume `i_end` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and the state would be:
State: **`mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `i_end + 1`**

Since we don't have the specific value of `i_end`, the most accurate general form is:
State: **`mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is incremented by 1**

But to be specific in the context of the format provided:
State: **`mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `i + 1`**
