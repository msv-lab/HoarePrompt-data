The code snippet `right += 1` increments the value of the variable `right` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `right` becomes `mid + 2`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 2) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid) // 2`, `leftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s` after adjustments, `rightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` after adjustments, `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s` after adjustments, `rightOne` is the total number of '1's in the second half of `s` after adjustments, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `mid + 2`.**
