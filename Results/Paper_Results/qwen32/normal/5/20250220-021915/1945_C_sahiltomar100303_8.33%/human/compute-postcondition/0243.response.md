Given the initial state, we need to determine the value of the variable `right` when the `print(right)` statement is executed.

From the precondition, we have the following information:
- `n` is the user's input.
- `right` is equal to `n`.
- The condition `left == 0` is true, and `right` is equal to `n`.

Since `right` is explicitly stated to be equal to `n`, and there are no operations or changes to `right` mentioned in the precondition, the value of `right` remains `n`.

Therefore, the `print(right)` statement will output the value of `n`.

Output: **n (where n is the user's input)**
