Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if `s[left - 2]` is '0', otherwise it is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s` minus 1 if `s[left - 2]` is not '0', otherwise it is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s` minus 1, `rightOne` is 3, `tleftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if `s[left - 2]` is '0', otherwise it is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `left` is `n // 2 - 1`, and `leftMove` is 0.** 

The only change is that `rightOne` has been incremented by 1, making its value 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
