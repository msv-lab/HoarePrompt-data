The code snippet only initializes `trightZero` to 0. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0.**
