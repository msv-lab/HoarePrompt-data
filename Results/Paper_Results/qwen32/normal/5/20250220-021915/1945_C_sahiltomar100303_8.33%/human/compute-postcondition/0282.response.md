The code `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` remains `t`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input string, `mid` remains `n // 2`, `left` is either 0 or not 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is 0, `tleftZero` remains 1 if `s[0]` is '0', otherwise 0, `tleftOne` remains 1 if `s[0]` is '1', otherwise 0, `trightZero` remains 0, `trightOne` remains 0, `leftZero` is incremented by 1, `leftOne` remains 1 if `s[0]` is '1', otherwise 0, `rightZero` remains 0, `rightOne` remains 0**.
