Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logic flaw. The code checks if the cumulative difference between the current sum of elements and the expected mean sum ever goes negative, which is not a sufficient condition to determine if the water can be evenly distributed.

Here's a detailed explanation of why the code is incorrect:

The logic in the `func_1` function is based on the idea that if the cumulative difference (`curr`) ever goes negative, it means that we cannot balance the water using the allowed operations. However, this is not always true. The code does not correctly account for the possibility of redistributing water from later containers to earlier ones, which could potentially balance the water levels.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 12
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Explanation:
- The total sum of water is 18, and 18 is divisible by 4, so the mean is 4.
- We can redistribute the water as follows:
  - Pour 3 units from the 4th container to the 1st container: [4, 2, 3, 9]
  - Pour 2 units from the 4th container to the 2nd container: [4, 4, 3, 7]

However, the provided code will output "NO" for this input because the cumulative difference will go negative at some point.

Thus, the code is
