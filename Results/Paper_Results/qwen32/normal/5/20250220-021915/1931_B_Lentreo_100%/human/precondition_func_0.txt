nums is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) is the number of containers, and the following n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n. The total number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is given in the first line of the input, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
