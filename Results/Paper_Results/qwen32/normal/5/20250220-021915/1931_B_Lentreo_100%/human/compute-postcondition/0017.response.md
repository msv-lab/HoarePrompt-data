The code snippet `curr += nums[i] - mean` updates the value of `curr` by adding the difference between the `i`-th inner list of `nums` and the `mean`. 

Given the initial state, `curr` was already defined as `curr + nums[i] - mean` and was ensured to be greater than or equal to 0. After the code execution, `curr` will be further updated to reflect the new addition.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers; `n` must be greater than 0; `total` is the sum of all integers in all inner lists of `nums`; `mean` is the integer result of `total // n`; `curr` is updated to `curr + nums[i] - mean` and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language: The output state remains the same in terms of the structure and conditions of the variables, except that `curr` has been updated by adding the difference between the `i`-th inner list of `nums` and the `mean`. The value of `i` is still `i + 1` as per the initial state description.
