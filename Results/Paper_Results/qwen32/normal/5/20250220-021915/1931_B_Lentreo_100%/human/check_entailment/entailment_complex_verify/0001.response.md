Let's carefully analyze the problem, the provided program, and the annotations to determine the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using a specific operation: pouring water from the i-th container to the j-th container where i < j. The sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, which means there exists a target amount of water each container should have.

### Key Observations:
1. **Total Water Divisibility**: The sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, n. This means the target amount of water for each container is `total_sum // n`.
2. **Operation Constraints**: Water can only be transferred from a container with a smaller index to one with a larger index.
3. **Feasibility Check**: To ensure feasibility, we need to check if we can maintain a non-negative balance of water as we iterate through the containers. If at any point the balance goes negative, it means we cannot achieve the target distribution.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`mean`).
2. It iterates through the list of containers, maintaining a running balance (`curr`) of water.
3. If at any point the running balance (`curr`) becomes negative, it returns "NO".
4. If the loop completes without the running balance going negative, it returns "YES".

### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call, `nums` is a list of integers representing the water amounts in the containers for a single test case.
- Inside the function, `n` is the number of containers, `total` is the sum of water in all containers, and `mean` is the target amount of water per container.
- `curr` is the running balance of water as we iterate through the containers.

### Correctness:
The annotations and the program logic seem to align with the problem requirements. However, there is a subtle issue in the annotations that needs to be addressed:
- The annotation states, "The program returns 'NO' if the total is not divisible by n." This is incorrect because the problem guarantees that the sum of water in each test case is divisible by n.
- The annotation also incorrectly states, "State: `nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers." This is incorrect because `nums` is a list of integers representing the water amounts for a single test case.

### Evaluation:
The logic of the program is correct based on the problem constraints and the annotations should be corrected to reflect the actual state of the program. The program correctly checks if the running balance of water is non-negative throughout the iteration, ensuring that the water can be redistributed to achieve the target amount in each container.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in terms of logic and meets the problem requirements. The original assessment was accurate in its reasoning and conclusion.

Final: **True**
