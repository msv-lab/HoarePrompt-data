To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and what conditions lead to a return value of 'NO'. The loop iterates over each test case in the `nums` list, updating `curr` by adding the difference between the current test case and the mean of all test cases. If `curr` ever becomes less than 0, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the loop continues until all iterations are completed.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we infer that `curr` has been non-negative throughout these iterations. Therefore, the loop will continue until `i` reaches `n`, the total number of test cases.

Here's the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations:

- `nums` remains the same list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains `n+1` integers.
- `n` remains the number of test cases.
- `total` remains the sum of all integers in all inner lists of `nums`.
- `mean` remains the integer result of `total // n`.
- `curr` will be the accumulated sum of `nums[i] - mean` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

The loop will not return 'NO' if `curr` never becomes less than 0 during any iteration. Therefore, the final value of `curr` will be the sum of the differences between each test case and the mean.

Output State: **`curr` is the sum of `nums[i] - mean` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and the function does not return 'NO'.**
