You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using a specific operation: pouring any amount of water from the i-th container to the j-th container, where i < j.

### Key Observations:
1. **Total Water Divisibility**: The sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, n. This means that the target amount of water in each container, if we could achieve it, would be `total_sum // n`.

2. **Operation Constraints**: The operation allows water to be transferred only from a container with a smaller index to one with a larger index. This means that once water is transferred to a container at a higher index, it cannot be transferred back to a container at a lower index.

3. **Feasibility Check**: To check if it's possible to balance the water, we need to ensure that at any point in the process of transferring water, we do not end up with a negative amount of water in any container. This can be checked by maintaining a running balance of water as we iterate through the containers.

### Program Analysis:
The given program follows a straightforward approach to check if it's possible to balance the water:
- It calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`mean`).
- It then iterates through the list of containers, maintaining a running balance (`curr`) of water.
- If at any point the running balance (`curr`) becomes negative, it returns "NO", indicating that it's not possible to balance the water.
- If the loop completes without the running balance going negative, it returns "YES".

### Correctness:
The logic of the program is correct because:
- The running balance (`curr`) ensures that we are not taking more water than is available from the containers we have processed so far.
- If the running balance is non-negative throughout the iteration, it means we can always transfer water in such a way that each container ends up with the target amount of water.

Therefore, the given program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
