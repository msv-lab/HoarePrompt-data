### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. Let's break down the program and its logic to see if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1(nums)`:**
   - **Total Calculation:** The function calculates the total amount of water `total` in the containers.
   - **Divisibility Check:** It checks if `total` is divisible by `n`. If not, it would return 'NO'. However, based on the problem description, we know that the sum of `a_i` for each test case is already guaranteed to be divisible by `n`, so this check is redundant but does not affect correctness.
   - **Mean Calculation:** It calculates the mean amount of water per container, `mean = total // n`.
   - **Balance Check:** It then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a running balance `curr` which is the sum of the differences between the current container's water amount and the mean. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it returns 'NO'. This is the key part of the logic:
     - If `curr` becomes negative, it means that the cumulative excess water in the previous containers is not enough to compensate for the deficit in the current container, making it impossible to balance the water levels with the given operation constraints.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Positive Balance:** If `curr` never becomes negative during the iteration, it means that the cumulative excess water in the previous containers can compensate for any deficits in the current and subsequent containers, allowing for equal distribution.
   - **Operation Constraint:** The operation constraint (pouring water from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed container) is respected by ensuring that any deficit encountered can be covered by previous excesses.

### Conclusion:

The logic implemented in `func_1(nums)` correctly determines if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same under the given constraints. The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
