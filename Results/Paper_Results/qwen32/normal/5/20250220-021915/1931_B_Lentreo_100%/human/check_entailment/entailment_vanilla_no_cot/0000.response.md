Correctness: **False**

The given program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function. The program checks if the cumulative deviation from the mean ever becomes negative, which is not the correct condition to determine if the water can be evenly distributed using the given operation (pouring water from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed container).

The key insight for solving this problem is that, for each container, the total amount of water that needs to be moved to the right (to higher-indexed containers) should never exceed the total amount of water that can be moved from the left (from lower-indexed containers). This means that the cumulative sum of the deviations from the mean should never be negative.

However, the program does not correctly implement this logic. Specifically, the check `if curr < 0` is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of moving water from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed containers later, which is not allowed by the problem constraints.

The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum of deviations from the mean is non-negative at all times, which the current implementation does correctly. However, the program's correctness is dependent on the assumption that the input constraints are strictly followed and that the sum of water is divisible by `n`, which is already guaranteed by the problem statement.

The main issue is the function `func_1` being called after the loop where it is defined, which is a syntax error in Python. The function definition should come before its call. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))
```

With this correction, the program should work as intended. However, the initial version provided in the question has the function call before its definition, which is a syntax error. Therefore, the initial version is incorrect.
