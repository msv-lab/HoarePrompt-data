Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains `n+1` integers; `n` is greater than 0; `total` is the sum of all integers in all inner lists of `nums`; `mean` is the integer result of `total // n`; `curr` is updated to `curr + nums[i] - mean` and the current value of `curr` is less than 0.**
