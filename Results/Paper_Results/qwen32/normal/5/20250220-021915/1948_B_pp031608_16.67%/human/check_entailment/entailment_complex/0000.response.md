### Reasoning:

The provided Python program attempts to determine if a given list of integers can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the list `n` and then the list of integers `list1`.

2. **Sorting Check**:
   - The program uses a helper function `func_1` to check if the list is already sorted. This function works correctly by comparing the list to its sorted version.

3. **Transformation Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the list, and if it finds an element that is out of order and greater than or equal to 10, it splits that element into its digits and inserts them back into the list.
   - The logic for splitting and inserting the digits is incorrect and incomplete. It only checks the current element and the one before it and only splits the previous element if it is greater than 10 and out of order. However, it does not handle the case where the split operation might affect the order of elements further down the list.
   - Moreover, the program does not guarantee that all elements will be checked and potentially split multiple times, which is necessary to fully transform the list into a sorted one.

4. **Output**:
   - After attempting to transform the list, the program checks if the list is sorted using `func_1` and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

### Issues:
- The program only checks and splits the previous element when it finds an out-of-order element, but it does not handle the case where the split operation might affect the order of elements further down the list.
- The program does not iterate multiple times to ensure that all elements are checked and potentially split until the list is sorted.
- The logic for splitting and reinserting elements is flawed and does not guarantee a correct transformation.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly implement the required transformation logic and cannot be guaranteed to produce the correct output for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
