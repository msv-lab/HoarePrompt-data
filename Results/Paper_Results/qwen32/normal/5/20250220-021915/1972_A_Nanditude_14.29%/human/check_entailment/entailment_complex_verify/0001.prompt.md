You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains three elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a list a of length n (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), and a list b of length n (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). The first element of arr is the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns the list `arr` sorted in reverse order. Each sublist (test case) in `arr` is considered as a single element during the sorting process, and the sorting is done based on the default lexicographical order of the sublists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists `arr`, where each sublist represents a test case with three elements: an integer `n`, a list `a` of length `n`, and a list `b` of length `n`. It returns the list `arr` sorted in reverse lexicographical order, treating each sublist as a single element.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the given program and compare it to the problem requirements step by step:

### Problem Requirements:
1. We have two lists `a` and `b` of equal length `n`, both sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. We need to ensure that every element in `a` is less than or equal to the corresponding element in `b`. If not, we can insert a new problem with a difficulty level `w` (which can be any value) into `a`, sort `a` again, and remove the most difficult problem (the last element in the sorted list).
3. We need to find the minimum number of such insertions required.

### Program Analysis:
- The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, the lists `a` and `b`.
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of insertions.
- It uses two pointers `i` and `j` to iterate over the lists `a` and `b`, respectively.
- The logic in the while loop checks if `b[j] < a[i]`:
  - If true, it means the current problem in `a` is more difficult than expected (`b`), so it replaces the current problem in `a` with `b[j]` and increments the counter `cnt`. It also increments `j` to move to the next expected difficulty.
  - If false, it simply moves to the next problem in both `a` and `b` by incrementing both `i` and `j`.
- After the loop, it prints the counter `cnt`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not sort `a` after inserting `b[j]`. Sorting is required as per the problem statement.
- The program replaces the problem in `a` with `b[j]` and then increments `j`, but it does not consider the possibility that `b[j]` might be greater than the next element in `a` after the replacement.
- The function `func_1(arr)` is defined but not used in the program.

### Correct Approach:
- We should iterate over both lists `a` and `b` simultaneously.
- If `a[i] > b[i]`, we need to insert a new problem with a difficulty level less than or equal to `b[i]`. This means we increment the counter `cnt` and continue checking the same `b[i]` with the next element in `a` after sorting.
- We should sort `a` after each insertion to maintain the non-decreasing order.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem requirements because it does not sort `a` after inserting `b[j]` and does not handle the scenario where `b[j]` might be less than the next element in `a` after replacement.
