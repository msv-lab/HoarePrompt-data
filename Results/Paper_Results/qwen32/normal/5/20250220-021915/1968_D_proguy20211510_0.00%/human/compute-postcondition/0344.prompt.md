Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k])]`, `sb` is `k*maxa`, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k])`, `i` is `k-1`, `ptsb` is `[preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1], ..., preb[k-1]]`, `ptss` is `[pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0], pres[1] + (k-2) * s[1], ..., pres[k-1]]`, `maxs` is `max(ptss)`, `maxb` is `max(ptsb)`, `maxa` is `max(a)`, `b` is `[]`, `s` is `[]`, `foundb` is `False`, `founds` is `False`, `n` is the first value from the input as an integer, `k` is the second value from the input as an integer, `pb` is the third value from the input as an integer, and `ps` is the fourth value from the input as an integer. `p` is a list of integers read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`. `sb` is `k*maxa`. `i` is `0`. `ptsb` is `[preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1], ..., preb[k-1]]`. `maxa` is `max(a)`. `n` is the first value from the input as an integer. `k` is greater than 0. `pb` is the third value from the input as an integer if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, otherwise `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`. `ps` is the fourth value from the input as an integer if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, otherwise `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`. `p` is a list of integers read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `foundb` is `True`. If `founds` is `True`, `pres` is recalculated based on the new `s` which includes `maxa` at the end, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k]) + maxa`, `ptss` is recalculated based on the new `pres`, `maxs` is recalculated based on the new `ptss`, and `s` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k]), maxa]`. If `founds` is `False`, then if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k]), ss + maxa]`, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k]) + maxa`, `ptss` is recalculated based on the new `pres`, `maxs` is recalculated based on the new `ptss`, `founds` is `True`, and `s` is `[s[0], s[1], ..., s[k-1], maxa]`. Otherwise, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k+1])]`, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k+1])`, `ptss` is recalculated based on the new `pres`, `maxs` is recalculated based on the new `ptss`, `founds` is `False`, and `s` is `[s[0], s[1], ..., s[k-1], a[ps - 1]]`. `maxb` is recalculated based on the new `ptsb`. `b` includes either `a[pb - 1]` or `maxa` as an additional element. `b` and `s` are not both `[(k - 1) * maxa]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`. `sb` is `k*maxa`. `i` is `1`. `ptsb` is recalculated based on the updated `preb` and `b`. `maxa` is `max(a)`. `n` is the first value from the input as an integer. `k` is greater than 0. `pb` is the third value from the input as an integer if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, otherwise `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`. `ps` is the fourth value from the input as an integer if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, otherwise `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`. `p` is a list of integers read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `foundb` is `True`. If `foundb` is `True`, `b` includes `maxa` as an additional element. If `founds` is `True`, `s` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k]), maxa]`. If `founds` is `False` and `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `s` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k]), a[ps - 1]]`. If `founds` is `False` and `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `s` is `[s[0], s[1], ..., s[k-1], a[ps - 1]]`. `maxb` is recalculated based on the new `ptsb`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both `True`, `b` includes `(k - 2) * maxa` and `s` is `[s[0], s[1], ..., s[k-1], (k - 2) * maxa]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, otherwise `s` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k]), (k - 2) * maxa]`. Otherwise, `b` and `s` remain unchanged as described above.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`, `sb` is `k*maxa`, `i` is `2`, `ptsb` is recalculated based on the updated `preb` and `b`, `maxa` is `max(a)`, `n` is the first value from the input as an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` is the third value from the input as an integer if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, otherwise `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the fourth value from the input as an integer if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, otherwise `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `foundb` is `True`. If `foundb` is `True` and `founds` is `True`, `b` includes `(k - 2) * maxa` and `s` is recalculated to include `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `foundb` is `True` and `founds` is `False`, `b` includes `maxa` and `s` is recalculated based on `founds` and `maxa`. `s` includes `maxa` if `founds` is `True`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, then `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` is included in `s`. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, then `ps` is the fourth value from the input as an integer. `maxb` is recalculated based on the new `ptsb`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
