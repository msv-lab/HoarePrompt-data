The code snippet `b.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the element at index `pb - 1` of the list `a` to the list `b`. 

Given the initial state, `pb` is an integer, and `a` is a list of integers. The value of `b` will now include the element `a[pb - 1]` as its new last element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` is a boolean value; `foundb` is True; `i` is 2; `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`; `s` includes an additional element `(k - 3) * maxa` if `foundb` and `founds` are both True, otherwise `s` includes `a[ps - 1]`.**
