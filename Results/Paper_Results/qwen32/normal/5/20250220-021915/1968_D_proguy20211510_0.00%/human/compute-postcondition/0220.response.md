The code snippet provided resets the values of `sb` and `ss` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is [], `pres` is [], `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `ptsb` is adjusted based on the elements in `b`, `ptss` is recalculated based on the elements in `s`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is `[maxa, maxa, ..., maxa]` (k times), `s` is `[a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1], ..., a[ps - 1]]` or `[a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1], ..., maxa]` if `founds` becomes `True`, `foundb` is `True`, and `founds` is a boolean that can be either `True` or `False`.**
