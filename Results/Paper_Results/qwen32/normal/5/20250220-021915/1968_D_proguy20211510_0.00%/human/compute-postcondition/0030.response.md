Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `b` and `s` are lists, where if both `foundb` and `founds` are True, `b` and `s` each contain one element `[(k - 1) * maxa]`; `founds` and `foundb` are boolean values, and if both are True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `i` is 0.**
