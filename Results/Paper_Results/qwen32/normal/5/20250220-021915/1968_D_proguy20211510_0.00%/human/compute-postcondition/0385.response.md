Postcondition: **`preb` is the cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is the cumulative sums of `s`, `sb` is `sum(b)`, `ss` is `sum(s)`, `i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `ptsb` is a list of `len(pres)` elements where each element is `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `ptss` is a list of `len(pres)` elements where each element is `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, and `maxs` is not greater than `maxb`. If `maxs` is less than `maxb`, the condition is met as stated. Otherwise, `maxs` is greater than or equal to `maxb`.**
