Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game in all cases. The main issue arises from the assumption that once a player reaches the maximum value in the array `a`, they will always stay there and gain the maximum score. However, this assumption is incorrect because the players can choose to move to different positions based on the permutation `p`, and the optimal strategy might involve moving to different positions to maximize their scores.

Here is a detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Optimal Strategy**: The program assumes that once a player reaches the maximum value in the array `a`, they will always stay there. However, the optimal strategy might involve moving to different positions based on the permutation `p` to maximize the score. The program does not consider this possibility.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**: The program calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha by appending the maximum value to the scores once a player reaches it. However, this does not correctly simulate the game where players can choose to move to different positions.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Cycles**: The program does not handle cycles in the permutation `p` correctly. Players can get stuck in cycles, and the program does not account for this possibility.

4. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Moves**: The program calculates the remaining moves incorrectly. It assumes that once a player reaches the maximum value, they will stay there for the remaining moves. However, this is not always the case, and the program does not consider the possibility of moving to different positions.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game for both players and calculate their scores based on their optimal strategies. This involves considering the cycles in the permutation `p` and calculating the scores for each player based on their movements.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def calculate_score(start):
            visited = [False] * n
            score = 0
            cycle_length = 0
            cycle_score = 0
            i = start - 1
            steps = 0
            
            while not visited[i]:
                visited[i] = True
                score += a[i]
                steps += 1
                if steps == k:
                    return score
                i = p[i] - 1
            
            cycle_start = i
            cycle_length = 1
            cycle_score = a[i]
            i = p[i] - 1
            
            while i != cycle_start:
                cycle_length += 1
                cycle_score += a[i]
                i = p[i] - 1
            
            remaining_steps = k - steps + cycle_length
            full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
            remaining_steps_in_cycle = remaining_steps % cycle_length
            
            score += full_cycles * cycle_score
            i = cycle_start
            for _ in range(remaining_steps_in_cycle):
                score += a[i]
                i = p[i] - 1
            
            return score
        
        bodya_score = calculate_score(pb)
        sasha_score = calculate_score(ps)
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version of the program simulates the game for both players and calculates their scores based on their optimal strategies, taking into account cycles in the permutation `p`.
