Output State: **`b` and `s` will contain the values appended in each iteration until either `k` iterations are completed or both `foundb` and `founds` are `True`. If both `foundb` and `founds` are `True` before `k` iterations, the final elements appended to `b` and `s` will be `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, and `maxa` remain unchanged. `preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list. `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0.**

In simple terms, the variables `sb` and `ss` have been initialized to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
