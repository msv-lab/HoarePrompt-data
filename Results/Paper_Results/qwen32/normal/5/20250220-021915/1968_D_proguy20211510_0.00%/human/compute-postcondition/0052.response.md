Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` and `foundb` are boolean values; `i` is 0. If `founds` is True, `s` contains `[(k - 1) * maxa, maxa]` if `foundb` is True or if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`. If `founds` is True and `foundb` is False and `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `s` contains `[(k - 1) * maxa, a[ps - 1]]`. If `founds` is False, `s` is not modified. If `foundb` is True, `b` is a list containing `[(k - 1) * maxa, maxa]`. If `foundb` is False, `b` is a list containing `[(k - 1) * maxa, maxa]` if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `b` is a list containing one element `a[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` is False and `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` is False, `pb` is always updated to `p[pb - 1]`.**
