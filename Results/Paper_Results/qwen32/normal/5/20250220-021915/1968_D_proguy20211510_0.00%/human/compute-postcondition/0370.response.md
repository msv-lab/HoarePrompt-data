The code snippet appends a new element to the list `ptsb`. The new element is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `len(s) + 1`, so the new element is `preb[len(s) + 1] + rem * b[len(s) + 1]`.

Since `rem` is defined as `k - (i + 1)`, and `i` is `len(s) + 1`, `rem` can be rewritten as `k - (len(s) + 1 + 1)` or `k - (len(s) + 2)`.

Therefore, the new element appended to `ptsb` is `preb[len(s) + 1] + (k - (len(s) + 2)) * b[len(s) + 1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`preb` is the cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list with at least `len(s) + 1` elements, `sb` is `sum(b)`, `ss` is `sum(s)`, `i` is `len(s) + 1`, `ptsb` is `ptsb` with an additional element `preb[len(s) + 1] + (k - (len(s) + 2)) * b[len(s) + 1]`, `ptss` is `ptss` with an additional element `pres[len(s)] + rem * s[len(s)]`, `rem` is `k - (len(s) + 2)`**.
