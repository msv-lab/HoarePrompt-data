Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are both equal to `maxa`, then the condition `a[pb - 1] == a[ps - 1] == maxa` holds. Otherwise, if `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, then `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`. If `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, then `a[ps - 1]` can either be equal to `maxa` or not equal to `maxa`. `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is False, `foundb` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` and `foundb` are boolean values; `i` is 0. If `founds` is True, `s` contains `[(k - 1) * maxa, maxa]` if `foundb` is True or if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`. If `founds` is True and `foundb` is False and `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `s` contains `[(k - 1) * maxa, a[ps - 1]]`. If `founds` is False, `s` is not modified. If `foundb` is True, `b` is a list containing `[(k - 1) * maxa, maxa]`. If `foundb` is False, `b` is a list containing `[(k - 1) * maxa, maxa]` if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `b` is a list containing one element `a[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` is False and `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` is False, `pb` is always updated to `p[pb - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` and `foundb` are boolean values; `i` is 1. If `founds` is True, `s` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, then `founds` becomes True and `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`. Otherwise, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` and `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` is True, then `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If both `foundb` and `founds` are True, then `s` includes an additional element `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `foundb` is False and `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, then `foundb` becomes True and `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. If both `foundb` and `founds` are True in this case, then `s` includes an additional element `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, then `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` and `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. In all cases where `foundb` and `founds` are not both True, `s` remains unchanged except for the addition of `a[ps - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` and `foundb` are boolean values; `i` is 2. If `foundb` is True, `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]` or `maxa`. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa` and both `foundb` and `founds` are True, `s` includes an additional element `(k - 3) * maxa`. Otherwise, `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]` or `maxa`. If `founds` is True, `s` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `founds` is False, `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
