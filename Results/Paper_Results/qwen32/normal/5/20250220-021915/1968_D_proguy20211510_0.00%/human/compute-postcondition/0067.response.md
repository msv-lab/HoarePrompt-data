The code snippet provided appends the value at index `ps - 1` of the list `a` to the list `s`. This means that the list `s` will now include an additional element, which is `a[ps - 1]`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` is True; `foundb` is a boolean value; `i` is 1. If `foundb` is True, then `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` is True and `founds` is also True, then `s` includes an additional element `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `foundb` is False, then if `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `foundb` becomes True and `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both True in this case, `s` includes an additional element `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` and `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. In all cases where `foundb` and `founds` are not both True, `s` remains unchanged. Additionally, `s` now includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`.**
