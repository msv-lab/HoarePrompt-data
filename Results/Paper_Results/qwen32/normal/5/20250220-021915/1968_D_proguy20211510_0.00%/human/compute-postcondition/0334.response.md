Output State: **`preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`, `sb` is `k*maxa`, `i` is `2`, `ptsb` is recalculated based on the updated `preb` and `b`, `maxa` is `max(a)`, `n` is the first value from the input as an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the fourth value from the input as an integer if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, otherwise `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `foundb` is `True`, `maxb` is recalculated based on the new `ptsb`, `b` includes `a[pb - 1]` appended to it.`**

Explanation: The value of `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
