Postcondition: **`preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, then `pres` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k]), ss + maxa]`, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k]) + maxa`, `founds` is `True`, and `s` is `[s[0], s[1], ..., s[k-1], maxa]`. Otherwise, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k+1])]`, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k+1])`, `founds` is `False`, and `s` is `[s[0], s[1], ..., s[k-1], a[ps - 1]]`. In both cases, `sb` remains `k*maxa`, `i` is `0`, `ptsb` is `[preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1], ..., preb[k-1]]`, `ptss` is recalculated based on the new `pres`, `maxs` is `max(ptss)`, `maxb` is `max(ptsb)`, `maxa` is `max(a)`, `n` is the first value from the input as an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` is the third value from the input as an integer if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, otherwise `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the fourth value from the input as an integer if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, otherwise `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `foundb` is `True`, and `b` includes either `a[pb - 1]` or `maxa` as an additional element. `b` and `s` are not both `[(k - 1) * maxa]`.**
