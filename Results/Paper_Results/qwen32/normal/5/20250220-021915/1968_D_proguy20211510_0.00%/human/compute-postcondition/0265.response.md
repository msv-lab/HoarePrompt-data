The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This operation does not affect any of the previously mentioned variables (`preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `i`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `foundb`, `founds`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`). The only change is the introduction of the new list `a`.

Output State: **`preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k])]`, `sb` is `k*maxa`, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k])`, `i` is `k-1`, `ptsb` is `[preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1], ..., preb[k-1]]`, `ptss` is `[pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0], pres[1] + (k-2) * s[1], ..., pres[k-1]]`, `maxs` is `max(ptss)`, `maxb` is `max(ptsb)`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `foundb`, and `founds` remain unchanged. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is strictly greater than `maxb`. If `maxs` is less than `maxb`, then `maxs` is strictly less than `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` is equal to `maxb`. `n` is the first value from the input as an integer, `k` is the second value from the input as an integer, `pb` is the third value from the input as an integer, and `ps` is the fourth value from the input as an integer. `p` is a list of integers read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
