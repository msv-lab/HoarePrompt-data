The code snippet `s.append(maxa)` appends the value of `maxa` to the list `s`. 

Given the initial state, `s` is initially `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k])]`. After appending `maxa` to `s`, the new list `s` will be `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k]), maxa]`.

Since `s` has changed, `pres` and `ptss` will also be affected because they are sums of elements in `s` up to each index. Specifically, `pres` will now include the cumulative sum up to the newly added `maxa` value, and `ptss` will be recalculated based on the new `pres` values.

However, the problem statement does not specify how `pres` and `ptss` are recalculated after `s` changes. Therefore, we will only update `s` and note that `pres` and `ptss` will need to be recalculated, but we won't specify their new values.

Additionally, `ss` (which is `sum(s[0:k])`) will also change as it includes the sum of all elements in `s` up to the `k`-th element. Since `maxa` is appended to `s`, `ss` will increase by `maxa`.

The variables `preb`, `sb`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `maxa`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `foundb`, and `founds` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`, `pres` is recalculated based on the new `s`, `sb` is `k*maxa`, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k]) + maxa`, `i` is `0`, `ptsb` is recalculated based on the new `pres`, `ptss` is recalculated based on the new `pres`, `maxs` is recalculated based on the new `ptss`, `maxb` is recalculated based on the new `ptsb`, `maxa` is `max(a)`, `n` is the first value from the input as an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` is the third value from the input as an integer if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, otherwise `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the fourth value from the input as an integer, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `foundb` is `True`, and `founds` is `True`. `s` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k]), maxa]`.**
