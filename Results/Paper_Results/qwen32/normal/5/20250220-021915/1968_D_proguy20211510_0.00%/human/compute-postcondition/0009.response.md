Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. The value at index `pb - 1` in `a` is equal to the value at index `ps - 1` in `a` and both are equal to `maxa`.**
