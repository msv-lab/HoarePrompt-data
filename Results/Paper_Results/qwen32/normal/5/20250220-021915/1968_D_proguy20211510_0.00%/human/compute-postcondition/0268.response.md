The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop structure provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, none of the variables are affected, and the state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k])]`, `sb` is `k*maxa`, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k])`, `i` is `k-1`, `ptsb` is `[preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1], ..., preb[k-1]]`, `ptss` is `[pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0], pres[1] + (k-2) * s[1], ..., pres[k-1]]`, `maxs` is `max(ptss)`, `maxb` is `max(ptsb)`, `maxa` is `max(a)`, `b`, `s`, `foundb`, and `founds` remain unchanged. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is strictly greater than `maxb`. If `maxs` is less than `maxb`, then `maxs` is strictly less than `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` is equal to `maxb`. `n` is the first value from the input as an integer, `k` is the second value from the input as an integer, `pb` is the third value from the input as an integer, and `ps` is the fourth value from the input as an integer. `p` is a list of integers read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
