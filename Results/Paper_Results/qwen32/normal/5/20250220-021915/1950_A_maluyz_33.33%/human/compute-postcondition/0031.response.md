Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input. If the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`, no changes are made to `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c`.**

This postcondition indicates that the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged regardless of whether `b` is the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`.
