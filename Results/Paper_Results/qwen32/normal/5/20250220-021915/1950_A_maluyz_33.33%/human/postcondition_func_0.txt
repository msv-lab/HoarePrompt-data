The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` each ranging from 0 to 9. For each test case, the function prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum of the three integers, and 'NONE' otherwise.
