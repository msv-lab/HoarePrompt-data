Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input.
- It is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`.
- It is not the case that `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is equal to `c`.
- The maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('PEAK')
```

From the initial state, we know the following:
- The value of `t` does not affect the print statement.
- The value of `i` does not affect the print statement.
- The conditions on `a`, `b`, and `c` do not affect the print statement directly.
- The print statement simply outputs the string `'PEAK'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, or `t`.

Output: **PEAK**
